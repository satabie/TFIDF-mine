A36UKFV79879MD,B00000DMAT,BX Lounger,5,5,"In the year 1997, Goldeneye was released for the Nintendo 64 by Rare, an unknown company and new 2nd party developer. Rare had already made several games for the NES and enters the Nintendo 64 market with this release based on the classic James Bond movie of the same title. You can ask anyone who had a Nintendo 64 if they ever played this game and why it was so popular. You're guaranteed to hear 2 reasons in particular why this game is so revered.REASON #1: This game is a prime example of how a developer took its time to make this game. It was more than 2 years since the movie it was based on came out and Rare had access to everything concerning the movie from the original orchestral music, likeness of the main characters and locations to the bonus villains of other James Bond movies such as Oddjob and Mayday. They didn't rush this out the door like some developers do when they wanted their games released alongside the films it was based on and it always guaranteed to be a huge mistake. This game was a huge success and is still played by many video gamers.REASON #2: Nintendo had no idea that the multi-player section of this game would be just as popular to play in or more popular than the single player mode. Rare admitted in an interview after the game was released that they had no intentions of putting together a multi-player mode until later in its development stages. Though it may be limited by today's standards, you had the basics: several stages based on the single player mode, all of the weapons were available, all of the main characters plus the enemy soldiers and classic Bond villains and several game modes such as free for all death match, team death match, you only live twice (2 lives) etc. and you can select the weapons in group categories along with time limits per match. This added a lot of re-playability after you finished the single player mode.If you don't have a Nintendo 64, this game is reason enough to get it. This game helped Nintendo sell so many systems and it is a title I highly recommend getting if you can find it. It's a great game to play by yourself and an absolute blast to play with 3 of your friends. Peace. :)",5,This is how all movie based video games should be made,2010/8/24 0:00

ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B00000DMAX,Micheal Hunt,2,1,"I played this game for week's years ago against a friend or 2 and it was great fun on multi-player. However when I played it one player I hated it. I thought it was too slow and real dodgy. But that was before I actually sat down and gave it a real go. And once you master the sliding/skid turn booster trick, it becomes a lot better.To do that; you just hold the R button down when going around bends and corners and tap the analogue stick in the opposite direction 3 times. The smoke goes from white, yellow to red then you let go the R and you have a slight boost. Once I had learned that it plays a lot faster.Overall, the graphics good and the levels are much bigger then the previous SNES version. But it lacks the same competitiveness and fun of the original version. But don't get me wrong, it is great for playing with friends, but it is a different feel from the original.In my opinion the best Mario Kart out is the GBA version because it is the SNES version with more tracks! (the original SNES tracks are unlockable in the GBA version!) But none the less, this version stands out on it's own.This version I didn't find to be as fun as the SNES one for a few reasons. They should have had more racers to choose from. And I miss my favourite driver the little Koopa Trooper, instead he's been taken out to make way for a slower Wario. But once I'd mastered that thing to take corners with, it was easy to place 1st in the 150cc.Overall, I give the one-player game 3 stars and the multiplayer 4.Cons: Not enough tracks and courses. Once you've mastered the courses on 150cc, there is no further challenges for you in single player mode.- Not enough drivers to choose.- The sound effects can be very annoying after a while (like Toads Whoa-Whoa-Whoa-Whoa sound)- No way to turn the objects off (like banana peels and the hazards of the coarse... it is really unfair sometimes)",3,Mommamia,2005/7/20 0:00

A2582KMXLK2P06,B00000F1GM,B. E Jackson,14,6,"I'm pretty sick and tired of people calling Super Mario 64 a classic.  It's not.  Just because it's significant and influential in helping pave the way for future Mario titles doesn't mean Super Mario 64 is deserving of its classic status, or that it's any fun to actually play.  Super Mario Galaxy came along and pretty much improved every single aspect of Super Mario 64 so you basically no longer have to play this game other than to get a dated taste of mid 90's gaming history.  The only other possible reason someone would play Super Mario 64 is because they desperately seek open world exploration, and this is basically the only Mario platformer that can at least attempt to satisfy gamers with that particular appetite.  Not that I personally believe the game succeeds at the exploring aspect either.The biggest problem is that so much of the land you explore consists of emptiness.  Oh sure you'll see trees, ramps, castles, buildings, enemies such as goombas, chain chomps, badly and laughably animated thwomps lifting up and slamming down, pokeys, rolling boulders, and other things that have become a trademark of the Mario series, but the amount of items to find and collect is *extremely* limited to coins (both yellow and red ones) and the occasional power-up that enables Mario to either fly (which admittedly is pretty fun) or obtain the incredibly boring metal cap that makes Mario invincible.  An alternative to the starman perhaps, with lousy side effects (Mario can't jump as high or far while wearing the metal cap).When you're not experiencing the endless disappointment that is running across empty and boring lands and basically doing nothing but wasting time, you're jumping across a series of unspectacular and very ordinary-presented platforms over and *over* again.  This stuff seriously resembles a beginners course for developing platforms.  It's extremely basic game design.  The platforms are generic square-shaped tiles for you to jump across that quite often are all the same exact size.  It gets monotonous almost immediately.  Only unreasonable Nintendo fans would eat this stuff up, seriously.  Anybody else would obviously be able to detect flawed, repetitive gameplay.  The 2D Mario games move at such a swift pace that you don't even have time to stop and notice the platforms (unless you're an extremely slow gamer).  This is mainly because you don't have to stop and situate Mario a certain way for the purpose of making the perfect jump which is what severely ruins Super Mario 64's gameplay.  And don't EVEN say my skills are horrible when it's obvious through countless youtube videos that several gamers have the same exact issue.While I'm by no means someone who cares about the best graphics available, you gotta admit the ones here have dated horrendously with embarrassing blocky shapes pretty much occupying most areas of the game.  The buildings, water and trees in particular are just awful for the eyes.  Nothing appealing whatsoever about any of the graphics- even the bright inviting colors don't lure me in but rather rub me the wrong way and force some of us older gamers to recall the unpleasant days of Mario Paint.You have to collect 120 stars in order to complete the game 100% but guess what?  Many of the stars are flat out boring to collect due to being pathetically easy and basically being handed to you within minutes.  What kind of challenge is that?  The one where you have to swim around and open treasure chests in a certain order is baby-ish, and the one where you swim around collecting 8 predictably located red coins inside a basic building near the beginning of the game is offensive.  Or how about simply stomping a post into a ground to release a gate and thus, release the star?  Don't even *think* about mentioning the ones where you walk up to Toad and he simply hands you the star.  Granted, the game seems to always alternate easy star-collecting challenges with longer and more drawn out ones as a way to balance things out but that's the problem- the stars are either too easy or too long.  There is one star mission so awful it makes your inevitable death seem like something to anticipate- the one where you have to jump across a series of moving poles.  You have to jump at *just* the right moment while making sure you're positioned in the right spot.  This takes forever and is dreadfully annoying.Also, what's up with all the little baby games?  Grab a baby penguin and slide down a snowy hill?  Chase the bunny so he doesn't hop away?  These are not suitable for anyone who recalls the challenging portions of previous 2D gaming such as Super Mario Bros. 3 or Super Mario World (and yes, these bunny grabbing missions are flaws in Super Mario Galaxy too, in case you think I'm intentionally favoring Super Mario Galaxy for no reason).  At least the cannon-shooting parts are cool.  It's fun figuring out where to launch Mario so he can land safely on upper grounds.I can't help but feel the red star collecting is overrated.  When you collect red stars in Yoshi's Island, you feel like you're given a really elaborate and perfectly executed assignment since you also have to collect flowers and stars to 100% complete a stage.  It's a lot to do not to mention really darn exciting and satisfying once you've acquired all these items, and constantly keeps your attention span in check while searching for them.  Super Mario 64 basically takes that one red coin-collecting element of Yoshi's Island and makes it a main priority here.  You often have to collect 8 red coins per stage (opposed to 20 in Yoshi's Island) to obtain one of the 120 stars.  Ugh.But nothing NOTHING is worse than the fact you have to re-enter stages over and over again just to grab all the stars that are located throughout.  To me this is unquestionably lazy game design.  How can it be anything else?  Who in their right mind would actually *want* to keep going back to the same exact stage ad nauseam?  Super Mario World was guilty of this too granted but not NEARLY to this exaggerated extent.  A terrible idea that gives a false impression a game has replay value but it's exactly the opposite- once you go through the same stage a bunch of times and finally accomplish everything there is to offer, you won't want to repeat these same objectives ever again.  So... you probably won't want to play Super Mario 64 ever again.  Even worse- when you often have to search for 100 coins to obtain a star.  This can take up to 20 minutes and bore you the entire time.  Being forced to collect 100 coins is a lazy way of assuring gamers don't leave any stone unturned because you basically have to thoroughly search every nook and cranny of a stage to even *find* 100 of them.I also dislike how many of the classic enemies aren't included here such as the hammer brothers, buzzy beetles, bloopers, and cheep cheeps.  Even the koopa troopa is nowhere to be seen (well, other than that one race in the beginning).  You can ride a koopa shell like a skateboard but that doesn't count as an enemy appearance.  He's not a true enemy here.  Why is that?  Why not include all the familiar and well-loved enemies that have become a trademark to the Mario series?  They ruin the pirahna plants by the way.  Why is he sleeping?  Granted he comes alive when you get near, but it's a really weird concept.  At least Nintendo got the boos and haunted house right- a surprising and exciting maze-like high point of the game.  It's a lot of fun sorting through each room of the haunted house stages.  *That's* how you design a memorable stage.  Obviously if you weren't busy running around through several vast and average-designed empty fields of grass, there could have EASILY been room for the inclusion of more enemies.  Hey I'm all for open world exploration, but you have to actually fill in those areas with exciting, creative items that are both fun and rewarding to collect for the player, and enemies that present threatening encounters and a rush of excitement.  Simply throwing Mario into a big 3D world because it's his first grand 3D adventure truthfully isn't going to get the job done I'm afraid.  More needs to be done.Constantly having to rearrange the camera so you can see where you're actually going is a nuisance.  Nobody likes dealing with a camera while jumping around trying to play a video game, but granted, several games back in the mid to late 90's were guilty of the same camera problems since developers were still getting their feet wet so to speak, and figuring out the best way to help players accurately and conveniently see what's ahead.  Still, you'll lose more than a few lives due to bad camera angles in Super Mario 64.  I guarantee it.  One thing I *do* like about this game is how fast Mario runs.  It's a fast-moving game, which helps going from point A to point B more convenient. Also some of the wall jumps and triple jumps are fun to execute.  Reminds me of Super Metroid in that respect.  Yoshi is teased in this game (I won't spoil how) but he's not actually playable which doesn't make sense.  Why make an appearance if he's not going to be playable?The music is either extremely good (the brilliant peaceful moodiness of the water theme and the intimidating and exciting heavy metal-like Bowser fights) or downright horrendous (everything else, which consists of annoying nursery rhyme children's themes inappropriate and painfully skull-smashing for the rest of us).  I can't STAND the theme songs that play in Whomp's Fortress and Rainbow Ride- two unforgivable themes that make me want to smash my brains in whenever I play Super Mario Galaxy 2 where they return in all their overbearingly annoying glory.  Rainbow Ride in particular reminds me of a county hayride where kids ride around on tractors (not to mention the stage itself is extremely tedious and overlong).  The snowy mountain stage with the Italian accordion music is sickening and out of place.  Just mute the volume on your TV to make life easier for yourself.  The boss fights are incredibly simplistic- grab Bowser's tail, spin him around and toss him, or pick up/stomp other bosses.  Basic, boring stuff.A few stages that are actually fun include Lethal Lava Land where the platforms convincingly feel like an upgrade into the 3D world from the original Super Mario Bros. castle levels (not to mention better/more interesting use of platform jumping compared to the rest of the levels in SM64), Shifting Sand Land since it's packed with obstacles and enemies (and reasonably challenging overall), and Tall Tall Mountain's tricky climb to the top (involving a vine climbing portion).  In fact, to be fair, Tall Tall Mountain is one of the best levels ever in a 3D Mario game.  It's *that* good.  Bowser's castle levels are pretty solid as well, mostly due to the fast-paced nature of them.Several things feel tacky- the 1-ups and coins are small, dark, ugly looking, and clumsily made due to less than spectacular graphics and game design, and overall Super Mario 64 is just a really lackluster and highly overrated game.  If not for influence, this game would have been forgotten and the superior Super Mario Galaxy series would have prevailed even more dominantly than they already do.  Oh and don't even mention the cake-eating storyline.  It's atrocious.  The fact they brought it back for the Galaxy series makes me want to vomit.",2,Mario's first jump into the land of 3D platforming stinks,2006/6/26 0:00
A36UKFV79879MD,B00000F1GM,BX Lounger,1,1,"For anyone who was a fan of video games, they remember the year of 1996:The Playstation made waves and drew many Nintendo fans away with its 32-bit graphics and CD based games. For the first time, Nintendo was being challenged on its own ground and they had to answer Sony with a console of its own. After they put the Super Nintendo system to rest, they went to work and released the Nintendo 64 to the public. The odds were against them because with only two launch titles to choose from, early adopters had to either pick Pilotwings 64 (a good game) or Super Mario 64. This game was the reason Nintendo's console immediately flew off the shelves and showed that Mario can make the jump to 3D and it was fun doing so.I'll make my review short because other reviewers had covered the basics and importance of Super Mario 64. It stars Mario in an open world where each stage is contained within various paintings scattered through Princess Peach's castle. The storyline is pretty typical by now: King Bowser kidnaps the princess and you jump in to rescue her. The graphics are colorful, bright and were a breakthrough in video game technology at the time. The controls are perfect and take almost no time to get used to. It's a pretty challenging game so expect to replay certain stages over and over again. So why did I give it 4.5 stars? The camera is not perfect but back then, getting the camera to work in any open world style game was difficult to program. It always centers behind you but sometimes gets a little wacky when you go up ledges or around corners. It gets annoying after awhile but you learn to tolerate it.What made this game groundbreaking was that games of this type proved to be a challenge to make and to make it fun as well is really the main goal. Super Mario 64 exceeds this and was a commercial success with gamers and gained much critical acclaim from reviewers of virtually every gaming publication. Those who say didn't like were in the minority and for reasons that were just too petty and silly. While gaming has changed tremendously since 1996, this game shows that the platform genre was at one point the kind of games that everyone wanted to play. And now, you can either track down the cartridge or get this for the Nintendo DS. So if you haven't played this, take a look for yourself as to why many gamers loved to play this game.

Now Mario has far more of an offense rather than just stomping enemies, he can now throw punches, kicks and slide into enemies, making full use of the 3D plane. The enemies come to life in 3D, such as huge chain chomps, menacing goombas and annoying koopas The graphics could have been better, because they make enemies out of simple colors rather than textures like more recent games have.

The first game that the system ran on was also a scream. It just sometimes comes to me as a surprise that a lot of these newer games that run on CD-ROM like the Playstation 2, and the XBOX may have faster and better graphics, but not likely with the actual loading time.Nintendo's Super Mario 64, remains as the most dynamic staple of any N64 system to date. The graphics are just completely amazing, and so strong from one angle to another. In Super MArio 64, you guide Mario through 15 terrific stages with exciting adventure around every corner. The object of the game is to try collect as many stars as possible that are hidden in the game. Each star is very vital inorder to help you save Peach, whom is still known as Princess Toadstool, from the vile Bowser. Each course takes you from all depths of the secret kingdom, from Sea, to the firey sky, and even in a spooky ghost-filled house. The load up time for this, and every other N64 game is much faster than the CD-Rom games for the PC, and the other CD-Rom console games.It is kind of sad Nintendo stopped making fantastic games on cartridge like this, and traded it for a CD-ROM gaming factory, with the Gamecube.

Having said that, it must be stated that SM64 is the greatest videogame to date, and one which all games, regardless of genre, will be judged henceforth. Nintendo set itself a nearly impossible goal and achieved it with SM64. Look closely, Mario's lineage is 2D -- not ideal material upon which to base the most intensely scrutinized 3D videogame ever. But videogames are, in the end, meant to entertain. And entertainment is at the heart of this fantastic title.Like many previous Mario games, experimentation is integral to the experience of playing. You must explore everything, leave no rock unturned, no mushroom mute, no door unopened. Mario himself has so many possible movements, and the environment is so intensely interactive, that even the least experimental players will spend hours on the first level without achieving anything in particular. The game is initially less accessible than previous Mario titles, although the three-pronged analog controller isn't really where the difficulty lies -- the joypad itself performs excellently. Overall, the biggest obstacle in the game is finding the correct viewpoint. The camera, which moves on its own (unless directed manually by using the four gold buttons), tries to find the optimal angle to view the action, though occasionally you're simply not able to see where you're going. Additionally, frustration sets in as you spin the camera around while simultaneously attempting to run across a moving plank or tip-toeing across a tiny ledge. But getting the hang of SM64 is all a matter of practice , and as soon you catch on, you will execute these skills unconsciously. The variety of levels and scale each world is simply breathtaking. The game consists of 15 massive courses in which Mario can attain seven stars per course, with numerous secret areas and bonuses, including 15 extra stars (for a total or 120 stars). It'll surely take the average gamer 60 hours to reach the third and final Bowser and free the princess (not to mention find Yoshi), so the game's replay value is bountiful. And despite all of their saccharin-sweet cuteness, the graphics are magnificent. Shigeru Miyamoto's dream of producing an interactive cartoon has been fully realized -- the animation is lavish, the textures rich, and even the most superfluous touches have been completely executed. SM64 is not perfect, however. Despite the efficiency of the hardware's Load Management, draw-in is noticeable, and occasionally gamers will look right through walls or objects. Still, this is as close to perfection a game has ever been (64-bit, no less). Super Mario 64 also puts Nintendo's preference of &quot;silicon over CDs&quot; to the test, with pleasingly familiar results. Most owners of either a Saturn or a PlayStation (or both), have by now acclimated to long load times, though grumblingly. Super Mario 64 will remind them of how gaming used to be: load time is nil, and reaching a playable level is only a matter of seconds. From the time you switch on the unit until you're done, the flow is seamless, and moving from one game area to another is instantaneous. Nintendo's musical prodigy, Koji Kondo, turns in an inspired performance, somehow finding room on the small cartridge to create the appropriate music for each world. Even though some tracks are cheesy, others, like the sitar-laden score of the first fire level, are more than effective in setting the mood for the level, and are as atmospheric as any Redbook audio. Also impressive are the sound effects: Mario's onscreen antics are matched by grunts, whoops, and hollers, fleshing out his spunky personality. As a whole, the flagship N64 game more than makes up for any painful delay (or delays) imposed upon the unit's release. SM64 is complete in every way, and the challenging experience of working toward each new level is far greater than the game's minimal flaws. Nintendo's craftsmanship and zeal for creating fantastically enjoyable games has never shown through more than in Super Mario 64. Nintendo 64's early flagship title demonstrates the power of the hardware as well as the creative genius of Miyamoto and team. Not only does the game obliterate every platformer before it in terms of visual finesse, it plays just as well if not infinitely better than previous 2D incarnations of the Mario franchise. 3D worlds are huge and cleverly laid-out so that there's never a dull moment. Secrets play a huge part of the experience, recapturing the classic gameplay style of the series. In fact, this game is exactly as one might hope it would be: Mario in 3D. More freedom, more space, more options, better graphics, improved and elaborated control schemes -- it's all there. Possibly the greatest videogame achievement ever. Don't rent.

A2LPJD19MGBNXJ,B00000JRSB,"Adrian Jenkins southerndudeman""""",2,1,"Wow, the reviews here run the gamut; while I am not surprised to see many bad reviews (sometimes, I think that people are just feeling spiteful, as I myself have another incarnation that does the same thing), it is odd to read such statements as &quot;This is destined to be the most disappointing RPG ever&quot; (and forgive me for ruining your writing for the sake of comprehensiblilty). FFVII was released in 1997, became possibly the best-selling RPG ever, has been lauded by most critics for years, and this is 2004. I think the ship of destiny has sailed.Anyway, I love this game. I have played it multiple times, and while it isn't my favorite FF title (that honor is shared by FFVI and FFVIII), it holds a special place in my heart. I read in the spotlight above that one reviewer gave up on the game because Aeris died; this seems odd (I mean, really, these are only video game characters, and can someone really get worked up that much over the merely-physical death of a single heroine?). I myself found this a bit silly (characters get killed all the time in RPGs; didn't Cloud have a Phoenix Down on hand?), but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the game. The gameplay, the sidequests, the graphics (for their time), the Chocobos - all come together quite well in this title. I particularly enjoyed the frustration (and ultimate satisfaction) of defeating Emerald and Ruby, and the storyline is OK as well. I'm sure that everyone has played this, but if you haven't, well, give it a try.",5,"Odd reviews, to be sure",2004/5/10 0:00
A2582KMXLK2P06,B00000JRSB,B. E Jackson,2,2,"People seem to forget the number one reason Final Fantasy 7 is loved so fondly and remembered all these years later- it was one of the first video games able to tell a story that MILLIONS of people cared about.  In fact, it's probably the first RPG to ever tell such an incredible story.  It was also groundbreaking back in the day having extremely-realistic cutscenes featured, along with a quest that carried over 3 discs.  That's why the game is remembered.However, I have no idea why the price for the game jumped up to almost 70 bucks these days.  I guess because everyone who owns the game refuses to give up their copy.",5,a great game,2007/3/18 0:00
A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B00000JRSB,blackaciddevil,7,6,"It wasn't until the Greatest Hits version came out that I ever really took an interest in Final Fantasy VII. I guess it was because I wanted to pursue the game in my own time. Besides, back when this game first came out, you hardly ever found a copy on the shelf to buy. I was always one of the unlucky ones, it seemed. Finally, after obtaining a copy for myself, I got to see what all the 'hoopla' was about.The story, itself(as you probably already know by playing it), is about Cloud Strife. Cloud is a mercenary who joins with a group of others(Avalanche) to stop a megacorporation callled Shinra. Shinra is draining the life of the planet to use as an energy source. Course, the story progresses and deepens when Sephiroth(the game's main antagonist) comes into play. Sephiroth's part in this story?...if the world is damaged, its' Lifestream will gather together in an attempt to heal the wound. Sephiroth plans to use a powerful spell called Meteor"" to cause this injury, and then merge with the planet's energy, allowing him to be reborn as a god. Then, he plans to rule over the planet.Final Fantasy VII has a long history behind it. FF7 was planned, first, as a new game for the SNES and was quickly moved to Nintendo's new system at the time, the Nintendo 64. Due to lack of catridge storage capacity, it eventually led to a dispute between Nintendo and Square that resulted in Square ending its long relationship with Nintendo.  Square decided, from that point, to release Final Fantasy VII for the Sony Playstation. The game has went on to sell well over 9.8 Million copies worldwide. It's spawned a series of other games under the FF7 name but none have quite reached the status that the original has. A remake has been rumored for quite some time now but, as of yet, no remake has been produced by Square. My opinion on the remake or lack thereof? Well, considering at to how they made a killing on fans buying the first game when it came out, it's almost guaranteed that they would make a killing a second time. I don't understand why they won't give the fans what they want. They'd come out alot better because of it. It would, definitely, put them back on top as the leader of RPGs..to be sure. Course, enough on the subject, right?Onto the meat of this review..What do I think of Final Fantasy VII?? First and foremost, it is quite an achievement in the RPG genre. It was the RPG where players found themselves in a three-dimensional world that, after playing the game, they actually felt like they'd went on an epic journey. It's the only game other than Legend of Zelda:Ocarina of Time where I ever felt that way. It was also the first RPG to really evoke some emotion out of me. The characters weren't two-dimensional, they had character and you could invest in that. It helped set the standard for all other RPGs to follow to this day. Too bad, though, you hardly see traditional turn-based RPGs like these anymore.  Sure, you may on the Nintendo DS and the Sony Playstation Portable but not much on any of the console systems these days. While it may seem dated in a time when everything is in 3-D and not 3-D on prerendered backgrounds, it still stands the test of time. The story holds up as well, even if it is a little hard to figure things out at times. The battles are engaging and the game is just fun! While I won't say it's my most favorite FF game; it's one of the games that got me hooked on RPGs. There's never a shortage of good things that can be said about this game.Do I have any gripes about the game? Just one thing...the ending.  The ending is kind of sudden and, as another reviewer stated elsewhere, it just ends. Not quite like Legacy of Kain:Soul Reaver did back in the day, though...nothing like that. The way it ends leaves you wanting more. Maybe it was intended to be that way...you think?All in all, Final Fantasy VII is a game that I highly highly recommend that everyone(and I do mean everyone) should play-at least once-even if you're not into RPGs. It'll definitely give you a better understanding of RPGs and why people love playing them so much.""",5,Final Fantasy VII.............,2010/8/18 0:00
A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B00000JRSB,"Christopher Barrett Evil Corgi""""",0,0,"Many years have passed since I first played this amazing title.  Love it or hate it, Final Fantasy 7 broke new ground in the RPG market, and games today have a lot to be thankful for that Final Fantasy 7 made possible.For those who haven't played this title, it is going to appear very dated, especially the hideously deformed polygon characters.  But the backgrounds are beautiful scenes based on hand drawn pictures.  The backgrounds are set, so they don't move.  Instead you move around them.  It was a style used extensively on the PS1 and still used in other games today (especially on the portable systems).  Granted, many of us would love to see a remake, and that might happen someday, but not likely any year soon.I will just sum up what I love about this game, even in today's market of amazing games (and a lot of terrible games or super easy games also).  First, the game was insanely easy.  I died once on my first play through (against Lost Number before I realized what to do), and I don't believe I saw a gameover screen since.  But the ease of the game is not an issue.  There is still some challenge, and part of what makes the game enjoyable is the lack of 'cheap' enemies.  But once you get the hang of things, it is super easy.The story is amazing, and only Final Fantasy 10 has really compared.  Final Fantasy 6 was such a great title, that I never thought anything could top it, but FF7 just drew me in and didn't let me go.  I couldn't believe the intrigue, the depth, the complexity of the story.  I found myself on edge at school (I was in high school when it first released) and I couldn't wait to get home to play it.  When Cloud goes against Rufus near the end of the Midgar arc, I knew I loved this game.  When it took over 2 hours of game play to get to a world map, I knew something was special.  And when the game cuts (in real time) to the CG of Junon's cannon, I was stunned.With the pretty games of this era, one might be unimpressed, but if you remember the era when this game was made, it broke ground that developers feared.  First true epic big budget RPG with cut scene CGI.  Low to zero loading times (so happy for that!).  A central character that is killed mid way through the game.  And an amazing depth of side quests and extras at the end of the game that were fun and rewarding.Going back, it may not match up against some more recent titles in every facet, but overall this is still a solid and spectacular game.  In my opinion only Zelda The Ocarina of Time and Super Mario World can compare with this title in overall quality and fun.  Though I have other personal favorites (big shout out for Ogre Battle!), I cannot argue that Final Fantasy 7 is among the three best games of all time, and easily the most ground breaking RPG ever.  As nostalgic as the earlier titles are (and I love them all), this game just proves that solid gameplay and an amazing story are timeless.",5,"Just played through it again, reinforces my love of this title ~",2010/8/5 0:00
A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00000JRSB,"Cloud ...""""",3,1,"My cousin was a HUGE RPG fan before I was and one day I got money for my birthday and I went uptown and he came along. He saw Final Fantasy VII on the shelves and bugged me to get it. So I eventually got it but found he was playing it more than me. So when he wasn't around, I sneaked and played his game and I got so wrapped up in the game I forgot I was still playing his game and he missed some plot elements. But I couldn't contain myself cause this was one of the best games I played, and still do, I'm currently on my 8th play.Story: Cloud, a former SOLDIER(kind of like an elite squad) member is recruited by Avalanche to help bring down the Shinra Corporation whose reactors are draining the planet of its energy. Where it goes from there involves a being from the sky, genetic experimentation and mind freak-outs.Music: Some of the best music ever is on the soundtrack. One track, Aeris's Theme is worth the price of it alone. This song can't be put into words, one of the most beautiful compositions I've ever listened to(and it's played in a sad scene but I won't spoil it). But this soundtrack also included a wide variety of music like rock(Boss Battle Theme)New age sounding(City of the Ancients), funk like(Wall Market) to ominous(Those Chosen By The Planet).Graphics: Back in 1997, these graphics were jawdropping. That opening sequence with Aeris, the entrance to Gold Saucer, and awakening of ancient beings were just amazing. They seem tame now but back then, they were gorgeous. It isn't flawless though: the characters look blocky"" like it'll have a big block for a hand and in some cases, you can see them without a mouth but it doesn't detract from the feel of the game.And one thing to note if you've haven't played a Final Fantasy before, yes it is Part VII but it's not like a saga where each part is a continuation of the story. It's all new story, characters, villains, worlds etc.For your spells and abilities, it includes the Materia System. While I'm not gonna spoil what a materia is, the basic function of it is to give you special abilities. Equip it on your weapon or armor and you can cast magic, summon beasts, counterattack, steal or give you some benefits. Master it and it'll create a new one. So awesome materia like Ultima, Knights of the Round or Mime can be replicated, giving you almost an endless string of summons.In VI and in VIII, certain special attacks can be accessed when a character was low health. Here it's a bar that fills up whenever you get attacked. Fill it up and you can unleash a string of powerful attacks, one big beam, or even cure party members. One flaw is that regular attacks can't be accessed so you can't save it for an approaching Boss, you either have to use magic or just defend.This is one of the best games you'll play and even though there's other games out currently that can distract, it always helps to go back to what started it all: what brought people into the RPG genre in a HUGE way: Final Fantasy VII.""",5,Best RPG Ever,2002/9/9 0:00

I never really liked RPG's, I'm more of an action gamer, but with all the hype surrounding this game, I figured what the [heck] and rented it a few days after it came out.  I was dumbfounded the first time I played it, I was speachless.  At the time I had never seen graphics like that, and the storyline was so engrossing that I felt a wave of depression actually set over me when I had to take it back.  As pathetic as that sounds, the day I returned it to the video store, I went out and bought Final Fantasy VII and kept playing for days.  Eventually I beat it, then a buddy of mine showed me his strategy guide and I realized I missed a lot of side stuff and extras, so I played through again using the guide, and the experience was even better.  If you have never played any Final Fantasy game before this one is worth picking up, even if you don't like RPG's you'll dig this, though I suggest picking up the BradyGames strategy guide to make the game even sweeter.

Rhodes,1,1,"Pros+A Very Deep, Engrossing and Heartfelt story+Memorable characters+Very Customizable game+Enriching soundtrack+Very detailed cinematics and incredible looking pre-rendered backgrouns+Tons and tons of optional things to doCons-The characters may be memorable, but the game does little to develop them beyond a certain point-There's no big incentive to use one character over another-It may very well be one of the easiest Final Fantasy games in the seriesAfter eleven years, Final Fantasy VII still manages to be a beast in the RPG field.  Boasting a colossal story and a few memorable characters.  Final Fantasy VII is the game which made the JRPG genre big in the West and eleven years later it still ranks as one of the greatest games of all time.Final Fantasy VII centers on Cloud Strife.  A mercenary who has joined the rebelious group known as AVALANCHE, who are taking on the Shinra Corporation, that is slowly draining the planet of its life.  The story all comes together by Cloud's mysterious past, a terrifying villain and some heartfelt characters.  The story of Final Fantasy VII spans so much more than just an evil Corporation.  You'll eventually find yourself on a journey that involves you saving the world.  Even compared to today, Final Fantasy VII is an RPG that breaks the rules of traditional storytelling.  Rather than being a band of teenagers out to stop some evil adults (as the JRPG has been drowned out in in recent years), Final Fantasy VII puts you in the role of characters about something more.  If there were any criticism of the story, it would be that it's a lot to take in.  Some things never really come together in the end and you'll be left with a lot of burning questions.  Much of this, you can bet, is due to some of Final Fantasy VII's shoddy translation.  There were some pieces in the localization process that were left out entirely and make the story come off as a little more sloppy than it was intended to.  Another small criticism comes with its characters.  While they're memorable, they often times take a backseat to some of the stories progression.  Once we learn what we need to learn about certain characters, the game never really touches them or makes them integral to the plot itself again.  If it weren't for their stark personalities, funny quips and own charms, you might forget them.Ever since Final Fantasy IV, the series has used the ATB battle system and Final Fantasy VII is no exception.  Every character has an ATB gauge that lets them take action once it's filled.  Pretty basic, but Final Fantasy VII gets a bump by being very customizable.  The Materia system allows for nearly endless possibilities for its characters.  There are several different kinds of Materia.  There's your basic magic materia that give you spells to cast, but there is also materia to give you more battle commands such as being able to steal or throw items at an enemy.  There are other materia there just to boost your stats and others that enhance your spells by giving you the ability to hit all the enemies at once or to absorb health from your enemies.  There are far more in each category and they give you infinite ways to play Final Fantasy VII.Without materia, though, your characters are naked and can only attack.  This brings about small problem.  The first being that there's is no incentive to use any one character above another.  Final Fantasy VII remedies this by givng its character ultra powerful limit breaks.  Every character has a limit gauge and when it fills up as they take damage.  When full they can let forth a brutal attack.  Characters also have limit levels for different limit breaks and the higher the Limit Level the more damage you have to take before its full.  Unfortunately, this is all that makes any character different in battle.  Materia gives them legs, but you can always transfer over anyone else's materia to anyone else.  In the long run this won't bother anyone, but it leads to a lack of variety in the characters and you more than likely won't need limit breaks that much to begin with.  Final Fantasy VII's pros more than outnumber the cons.  The amount of customization is great, but it still would've been nice to need one character's ability over another.Final Fantasy VII is by no means a hard game.  It is arguably one of the easiest games in the series.  In particular, the final battle turns out to be one of the easiest fights in the game against someone who has often been labeled one of the most threatening in history.  Yet Final Fantasy VII makes for that with several hidden goodies.  You won't find too many optional dungeons in Final Fantasy VII, but you will find an incredible number of optional things to do off the beaten path.  From breeding and racing Chocobos, to finding hidden materia, to taking on ultra powerful bosses and even finding hidden characters who have more than just a face, but actually play into the story itself.  There are more secrets in Final Fantasy VII than even most RPGs of today.Graphically Final Fantasy VII is a mixed bag.  In 1997 these graphics were phenominal.  the pre-rendered backgrounds are still incredible looking even to this day.  The seventh Final Fantasy has a lot of style.  The polygons are charming though they don't look as cool as the rest of the environments.  The FMVs are still amazing and wonderfully detailed for its time.  There are a couple of moments of slowdown with Final Fantasy VII, however, and some of the summon animations can get lengthy and repetitive.  But they don't take away from its wildly detaile environments.The music score may actually be the most rewarding thing for Final Fantasy VII.  The music score manages to fill the situations for the right moment.  But it also isn't afraid to showcase a lot of emotion either.  There are some moments where it can be dark and others where it's very light.  In particular, the character themes are really nice and memorable.  Final Fantasy VII doesn't have the best soundtrack within the series, but it has some of the most memorable music numbers of the entire series.After eleven years Final Fantasy VII is still a force to be reckoned with.  There are a few gaps in its storyline that you may have to read a bit more deeply to learn about (as not all of it is within the game itself, but if anything confuses you there have been countless FAQs written as well as spin-offs and sequels) and it shuns some of its characters at points, but the package is still one of the best Playstation outings of all time, and every gamer should pick up and play Final Fantasy VII at least once.",5,One of the Finest RPG Outings,2008/9/14 0:00

A2582KMXLK2P06,B00000K2R4,B. E Jackson,54,8,"Finally, Sega releases a video game system that rises above mediocrity!  Sega is famous for all kinds of failed (and embarrassing) video game consoles they brought to the world, but this time they actually kind of"" got it right with the Dreamcast.Unfortunately, Sega made a gigantic mistake that almost immediately brought down any chance of the Dreamcast becoming a success.  They chose to release the Dreamcast in late 1999.  Gaming fans vividly remember what happened to the Sega Saturn just a couple years before, and people weren't going to be fooled again.  This was now or never for Sega.  If the Dreamcast failed, Sega would be gone from the hardware market forever.The release date for the Dreamcast was getting closer and closer.  It was in September of 1999.  People were still very happy with their Playstation One because 1999 was one of Sony's highlights for spectacular and revolutionary gaming.  That wasn't the only thing going on.  Sony fans were also anticipating the release of the Playstation 2, which was guaranteed to become the dominant console thanks to the relentless power and popularity the Playstation One was responsible for.  It was during this time Sony was far and away the most powerful company in the video game business.  Sega saw trouble ahead but continued to move forward with the expected Dreamcast release date.Nintendo was also very much alive and in the big picture with the Gamecube.  Nintendo was content on making sure their fans would NOT be disappointed with the Gamecube the way they were with the N64.  Nintendo fans are loyal.  *Nothing* can knock out Nintendo.  Nintendo recognized their mistake with the N64 and knew they could make it right again.  They knew they could give the Playstation 2 a run for its money (and looking back, Nintendo did just that).And so, the release date for the Dreamcast arrived.  With Nintendo and Sony on top of their game, what would happen?  What would happen to Sega?  The Dreamcast would hit the market and... nothing.  No sound.  No noise.  So little was said about the Dreamcast on the release date that it was like Sega had died right then and there.  An eerie silence for a company that gave the world Sonic the Hedgehog.The Dreamcast failed because there were already more than enough successful gaming consoles on the market in 1999, and people didn't want the Dreamcast to interfere with the superior, soon-to-be-released Sony and Nintendo gaming systems.  Sega also failed because of their long, frustrating history of ripping people off with unsatisfactory video game systems (such as the Sega CD and Sega Saturn).  Sega would fool people into thinking they had something extraordinary in the works... only to end up not supporting it.  They had trouble supporting the video game consoles they created and would often leave people with failed attempts and false hopes.  Sega would always fall asleep on the job.  This would happen time and time again, with Sega hoping the brain-dead masses would buy their average, incomplete gaming consoles.  It's like the people who worked for Sega would always say ""let's start something and not finish it"".When Sega failed YET AGAIN with the Saturn, people finally couldn't TAKE anymore.  Anyone who was still a Sega fan by that point pretty much lost all hope.  Sega was now the enemy and they had to go.  A gaming console needs a giant selection of games, and unfortunately Sega only understood that ONE TIME in their lackluster history (with the Genesis).  Every other console they released only had a few classics to choose from among a bunch of average games.In the case of the Dreamcast, Sega tried to support it but it was too late.  Sony had defeated them.  Sony had defeated BOTH the Saturn and the Dreamcast with the overpowering success of the Playstation One.  Hard to believe but it's true: the Playstation One knocked out BOTH the Saturn and the Dreamcast  off the market, making both of those consoles nothing more than a disappointing memory for Sega fans.In 1999, Sega knew they wouldn't be able to compete with the Playstation 2, so they finally did the right thing in early 2001 by announcing that they would never again make another video game console.  Sega was DONE.  They admitted defeat.  That, my friends, made milions and millions of people very happy.  No more junk on the market.  That announcement was the best thing that could have happened, and if you happened to glance outside that day you would have noticed the sun smiling down on everyone.That meant no more arrogant Sega promotion.  I used to hate the way Sega would always promote their games by putting down Nintendo and Sony.  Now I can laugh at it.  Sega really thought they could trick people into buying their crappy games by constantly making fun of Nintendo and Sony.  Didn't work.  Nintendo and Sony fans are too smart and considerate for that immature nonsense.  I bet everyone responsible for the Playstation's creation were laughing in piles of money over the ""fly, play thing, fly"" commercial that Sega created in an attempt to make Sony look second-rate.  Ha!  That ugly, gray-colored box destroyed both the Saturn and the Dreamcast, and I hope Sega fans never forget it.It's almost 2007 and people are STILL talking about the Gamecube and Playstation 2.  Why?  Because they are successful video game consoles.  People will look back and REMEMBER them as successful consoles.  No one remembers that the Dreamcast tried to compete with them at one point.  People forgot the Dreamcast even EXISTED when the year 2002 came around.  Sega's video game consoles immediately became dated and forgettable once companies stopped making games for them.  If Sega had put less energy into putting down the competition and more energy into offering their customers *complete* and enjoyable gaming consoles, maybe they'd still be around today.  As it stands, they deserved to watch Nintendo and Sony destroy them.  Nintendo and Sony didn't have to stoop to dirty tactics to win over fans and the world is now a better place.With the release of Nintendo's new revolutionary Wii system coming to America this November, along with the Playstation 3, we don't have to laugh at Sega's silly attempt to compete only to end up being the laughing stock of the world.

With Dreamcast, Sega moves beyond Sonic into a heavily graphic and net-savvy arcade machine.Probably the biggest difference between the Dreamcast and its competitors is the built in 56k modem. This allows Dreamcast owners to log on to the net, surf the web, and fight other opponents head to head. This opens up a HUGE opportunity for finding playmates that until now was restricted to computer gamers. The web surfing ability only sweetens the deal, although like WebTV, there is no ability to download.It's not for free - ... - but for a household that is currently not on the Internet, the price gets both the web access and unlimited gameplay. You also need to buy a keyboard if you wish to do any web work.Like the Sony Playstation, the Dreamcast will play audio CDs. Unlike the Playstation 2, it will not play DVDs, however. Also, while the Playstation 2 can play all Playstation games (since both are CD based) the Sega Dreamcast cannot play older Sega games.Popular Sega games tend to be arcade or fighting games - Rayman 2, Street Fighter Alpha 3. The incredibly high polygon draw rate (three million polygons per second) means that these games fly, giving great gameplay.Even though this is equipped with a 12x CD player, it's still slower than a cartridge system like the N64. On the up-side, CDs are cheaper than cartridges, and can hold a lot more information on them, leading to more involved games.I'm personally not a huge Dreamcast fan - the types of games available on it aren't ones that tend to appeal to me - but my arcade and fighting loving friends enjoy it a great deal.Specifications: CPU: 128-bit RISC Clock Speed: 200 MHz  Sound: CD quality, 64 voices Connector: standard 3-plug video/audio connector 1600 x 1200 resolution",4,"Great arcade and fighting appeal, plus internet play!",2000/11/22 0:00

Now I have a stunning 119 games for the SNES alone, meaning it has the biggest selection of games of any of my other systems. NO ONE SHOULD DISLIKE THIS GAME IN ANY WAY, IF YOU DO, YOU MUST REALLY DISLIKE CLASSICS IN GENERAL. It is one of the wildest and insane games ever made, and that is a clear signature of the originality of Nintendo. The game is basically about Mario and Luigi battling their way through the island while defeating the forces of Bowser yet again and rescuing the damsel in distress YET AGAIN. As you beat the different sections of the island you move to larger and much more challenging sections of the island which get crazier as you move from stage to stage. The boss battles can be challenging and funny because of how the bosses are designed. No retro gamer should miss out on this hilarious and original game that is still a lot of fun to play despite its release almost 20 years ago (in a few more years it's going to hit 20). One problem is the fact this game can be quite challenging and confusing in some areas. And the Game Boy Advance version of this game lets you play either Mario or Luigi (it doesn't make you stay exclusive to one during segments of the game). Still, if you don't have a SNES, you can easily find this game on Game Boy Advance and it looks and plays the same as the original classic.",5,"A QUIRKY, ENTERTAINING, WILD, AND FUN ADVENTURE  8.75 OUT OF 10",2007/12/28 0:00
A2582KMXLK2P06,B00002STXQ,B. E Jackson,14,3,"(This review was updated on July 10th, 2006)I've changed my mind about Super Mario World and actually think it deserves 4 stars.  I was just in a bad mood when I originally gave the game a 2-star rating.  It turns out Super Mario World is not just a game you can enjoy growing up in the early 90's.  It actually has a lot of replay value and years later our children can enjoy Super Mario World the same way WE did.I still stand by what I say in the original review: The Donkey Kong Country series, for example, came along with a similar idea and made it more exciting IMO, so, if I were you I'd go with one of those games instead of Super Mario World.  For the most part the levels in the DKC series feel different from each other (plus, they feel more creative and memorable).  Unfortunately, many of the levels in Super Mario World are all basically the same and, as a result, I feel exhausted after playing the game for two hours.To put it another way- in Super Mario World it feels like you're going through the levels simply to collect coins and extra lives.  In the Donkey Kong Country series, you pretty much do the same thing (except bananas instead of coins) but it seems like the DKC series offers more creativity in the level design, which allows you to look forward to each stage and think to yourself ""I wonder what cool thing I get to do in THIS stage"".  It's not like that in Super Mario World.""I still believe that, but I've recently come to change my mind a little and think that, even though most of the levels in Super Mario World feel the same, that's not necessarily a BAD thing.  I also don't think the graphics in SMW are as nice as many reviewers think.  They sort of look blocky but, to their credit, Nintendo games have always had plenty of pretty colors, which is a plus.So go ahead and buy Super Mario World if you want to experience the joy of old-school Mario (the games MY generation grew up with).  After all, it's Mario and Mario games always have something decent going for them (except Mario Is Missing, but with time we've come to realize that game never even existed!)Super Mario World is basically Super Mario Bros. 3 (but without all the cool Mario suits and less creative worlds).  I like in Super Mario Bros. 3 how you have water, desert, air, plant and ice worlds (in addition to more).  In Super Mario World you just have UNUSUAL worlds such as Chocolate Island and Forest of Illusion.  Those aren't as neat as the worlds in Super Mario Bros. 3.  Super Mario World should have been the best Mario game yet but Nintendo took a few steps back (but with a MONSTER like Super Mario Bros. 3 I guess it would have been difficult to make a better Mario game right after it).Another problem in Super Mario World is that if you want to get a perfect score (96) you not only have to reach the goal in every single level, but you also have to find and grab a key in certain levels (but not all levels have keys).  This means you have to go through many levels a SECOND time.  It's sort of boring.  Once is enough.  The concept of collecting keys wasn't a good one.  I guess the good part is that if you are wearing a cape, you can quickly fly through the levels (except for water levels, and any level where the screen pushes you to the right) but that's not fun either because all you do is continue flying and pushing the back button to stay up high in the air until you reach the goal (or the key).  However, at the end of the day none of this is really enough to make the game bad in any way.  I just get tired of it.Go ahead and get it.  Yes, it's a classic.""",2,good game... but maybe not quite a classic,2003/12/30 0:00

It was a great time to be a video gamer. For the past 5 years, the NES was on top of the world and home to so many memorable games. While the Sega Master System was its rival, it enjoyed more of a cult following as the majority of video games were released for the NES. But like all good things, they come to an end as Sega ushered in a brand new console. The Sega Genesis, released in 1989, featured new technology and more horsepower to display flashier games and brought a new video games icon to rival Mario and Nintendo. Nintendo responded by releasing the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and a brand new Mario game (Super Mario World.) This was the game packed in with the console and was responsible for maintaining the large fan base the original NES had built up for years.To say this made an impact to gamers would be an understatement.Hot off the heels of the excellent Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World was the sequel that showcased the SNES's graphical prowess and ability to display new effects. 8 new worlds to explore (plus the hidden star portals) and 99 levels lie in wait for gamers to explore. It introduced new enemy characters as well as the lovable dinosaur Yoshi. And above all, it was extremely fun to play. From the graphics to the music and the easy to get into controls, this game continued the proud tradition of the revered Mario games and set standards for all future platform games to come.While there are many ways to track down this title (the original SNES cartridge, the Game Boy Advance title and through Nintendo's Virtual Console service for those who have a Wii that is online), any true gamer has played this many, many times and can tell you that it was one of the finest games to ever come out from Nintendo.****HIGHLY RECOMMENDED***",5,Mario's first venture into the 16-bit console wars,2010/12/21 0:00

So when news broke that it was coming out for the SNES and Genesis consoles, everyone rejoiced and the bragging rights for best version of this game was up for grabs. When the dust cleared, it was obvious each version had its pros and cons.For the SNES this was, for the most part, a faithful port of the arcade game. It had all the stages and the Test Your Might"" mini-games, the original music, the original characters plus the secret character and the end boss, Shang Tsung. The graphics were crisp and clear while the music sounded just like in the arcade game; controls were easy to get used like in the arcade game. However, the game came heavily censored; the blood was changed to look like sweat. Some of the fatalities were toned down considerably and replaced with ""non violent"" finishing moves (Kano, Sub Zero, Johnny Cage and Raiden.) They even went as far as to make sure you could not send anyone through the spikes at one stage that takes place on top of a bridge when you wanted to fulfill the requirement to fight the secret character, Reptile. The controls, while easy to get used to, were slightly changed from the arcade game and some of the basic moves were taken out entirely.So it was a major gamble for Nintendo that didn't pay off; the Genesis version, while regarded as inferior to the SNES version because of its fuzzy graphics and featured different music for the stages, had the gore and fatalities available as long as you entered a secret code. Sales wise, it beat out the SNES version as punishment for the backlash against Nintendo's family friendly policy.Pick this one up only for nostalgic reasons as Mortal Kombat II, is the sequel and better game and it came out fully uncensored.""",3,A tremendous achievment marred by gameplay,2010/8/16 0:00

Really if this was the only version I'd played, I would've never gussed what all the hype was about.Graphics and audio are pretty good, far surpassing what the Genesis version was offering and staying pretty true to the arcade version. Gameplay however, is a failure. Nevermind that the fatalities have been changed and the blood turned to sweat - the actual fighting is stiff and unresponsive, and it feels like the fighters have their feet glued to the floor. The only move that works well here is Scorpion's spear, and it's so smooth in its execution that it becomes the best way of landing cheap hits.Look at MK objectively: bad controls, less characters than Street Fighter, less moves, a limited number of environments with no background animation (though the Pit idea was rather cool). The first installment was truly one that sold based on the strength of its gore, and on the SNES we're deprived of that as well.MK fans might or might not want this version for completion purposes (since it looks graphically like the arcade but removes all the violent content).

Nintendo had handed over to them a well known but dormant franchise at the time and using ACM graphics, this stunning game wowed anyone who played this title for the first time back then. It was considered state of the art for its time and it made owning an SNES console even better.In Donkey Kong Country, you control Donkey Kong and his sidekick Diddy and set off to get back Donkey's Kong most prized possession: his banana hoard. King K Rool, the main villain and his army of animals, have taken over the island and to defeat him, you must travel through 6 worlds filled with stages and then confront King Rool on his pirate ship. There are many ways to earn extra lives and some of the local friendly animals lend DK and Diddy a hand from time to time. In addition to completing the stages, there are many secret rooms scattered through most of the stages just waiting to be discovered. In the one player game, you control both characters. In the 2 player game, you and another player can play together cooperatively. In the 2 player contest, you and another player take turns in playing the game. When you reach a certain character in each world, you are allowed to save your progress.The PROS: This game blew away gamers back in the 90's and it's one of the few retro games where it has aged well. A side scrolling platform game starring one of Nintendo's recognizable characters meant it was going to be a good time for all and it was. Thanks to the awesome graphics, sounds and music plus tongue in cheek humor, each themed world is filled with stages brimming with enough variety to keep it fun. To cram it all in into a cartridge is a remarkable achievement as nothing was sacrificed. It's fun by yourself and when you bring in another person and the game is hard enough to challenge you but not overwhelm you at the same time. Adding hidden areas and secrets gave it more replay value.The CONS: Nothing. It's a perfectly balanced game.The Donkey Kong Country trilogy began with this crowning achievement. This game sold millions and gathered praise and critical success and there was good reason for it. Thanks to the success of this game, Rare released two sequels and they too have sold well.

There is one company, however, named Nintendo, and it created Donkey Kong Country. Donkey Kong Country was a game that proved that you don't need CD-based technology to make games with flashy graphics. You just need to put in effort to fit it to your console.DKC's graphics were incredible on the Super Nintendo. The game almost looked like the characters came from a CGI movie. At least, at its time. Even the backgrounds had tons of details and neat movements.The sounds and music were memorable. Even when you defeat a Kremling (alligator enemy), his voice effect when he dies will always be remembered for a long time. As for the music, well, you can never go wrong with the sweet beats of Kongo Jungle and the King K. Rool boss battle.The game is one of those games that show the characters on a map before actually going into the levels. Once you go to a level, you're gonna be expecting barrel-blasting, Kremling-smashing, animal-romping fun! There is a lot to do in Donkey Kong Country. As a platformer, it doesn't disappoint with its gameplay. You can even ride atop an Animal Buddy, like a rhino or an ostrich. Rhinos can knock everybody out of its way, while the Ostrich guides you safely across the level. It can also float in the air like Racoon Mario in Super Mario Bros 3. The entire game is a bunch of fun.The multiplayer is pretty cool, too. While you can't REALLY play co-op like in the new DKC game that's out on Wii, your friend can cover in for you if you die. One player plays as Donkey Kong, and the other plays as Diddy Kong. Once one player is participating in the action, the other player can't really do anything. But if that one player dies or presses Select, then it's time for the second player to play. You can also compete against each other.To save, you must reach Candy's Save Point. Personally, I wish they added a save anytime kind of feature. But that is a minor complaint.Overall, this is a really great Super NES gem. It's worth the money.

This is especially appearant now that the game is over a decade old(!) and the flash no longer holds up as well on the GBA port.Still Rareware really did an excellent job, and their success here propelled the company to a strong supporting role on the Nintendo 64. Gameplay is on the easy side, but the levels are still a blast to play through. There are lots of varied environments and things to see, with no dull moments in sight. A fitting memorable soundtrack adds to the experience. Plus, Donkey Kong Country revitalized one of Nintendo's dormant characters, taking him from a pixelated barrel-throwing ape to a rendered, barrel-throwing ape with attitude.Overall there's a great experience here, just one that's a bit on the easy side. The two sequels ramp up the difficulty level considerably, and together the games form a fine trilogy on the SNES.",4,Donkey Kong reborn,2006/9/2 0:00

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000035Y6D,S. Rhodes,3,3,"Anyone who was around in the NES days knows how fun those games were. Nearly anyone around for the Super Nintendo generation will without a doubt call it: The Greatest System of the Gaming World.While many have updated to the PS2, GCN and XBOX, the SNES is still strong even to this day. The games are classics (and actually led to a lot of successful games found on the PSX and PS2) and don't depend so heavily on eye-candy and if you can believe it, PSX games like Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy VII made people WANT an SNES even more (so we could play Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy III/VI).So what makes the SNES so strong in not only Nintendo's franchise, but in gaming in general?  Well, to start off the controller is by far the most comfortable of any game system ever.  The controller has lead to other controllers that have copied the design (The PSX/PS2 controller is almost an exact duplicate).Second is these games are incredible!  The SNES has some of the greatest games of any series. Several FF fans call FFVI the best one, several Zelda fans call Link to the Past the best one, several Mario fans call Super Mario RPG the best one.  Not to mention we've had lots of gaming goodness.  The Donkey Kong Trilogy, Secret of Mana, Contra III, the Mega Man X series debuted here as well.  The Super Nintendo set the standard for gaming as we know it!  How many of us were blown away by Donkey Kong Country when it was released? A whole lot of us were! Compare the amazement DKC gave off to what DK64 gave off.Several different genres, the SNES provides great Action/Adventure, RPGs, Puzzles and more!  The SNES even has educational games.  It's the perfect family console!But there are a few problems.  The first one being the system is out of date and it's actually harder to find now. But you can get it at a cheap price (usually ranging from 25 to 50 bucks).The second con is...some of the games that are really popular, are sold for OUTRAGEOUS prices! Go to ebay and type in Chrono Trigger and you'll see that go for as much as 300 dollars!  Other games that are really popular have been released on the Gameboy Advance (Such as The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Donkey Kong Country).  So while the games are great, some you'll have to be willing to pay a lot for, others are re-released and can't rekindle the magic of the original.The Good:+Still strong after all these years!

E Jackson,4,3,"Younger Mega Man fans won't know just how popular and fun this game was back in the day, and how the years have gone by and the game is STILL a lot of fun.So many positive things can be said about Mega Man 2. The fantastic theme music, which is still the best music in a Mega Man game to date. Every single tune in this game is amazingly creative and memorable. If you don't think so you're crazy.Another thing that fascinates me is how people can never decide which of the first three Mega Man games is the best one. The first one I have never played, but they say it's extremely challenging, and because it only features 6 bosses, I don't think it's possible for me to prefer that one over Mega Man 2.Then we have Mega Man 3, which video game fans like to compete with Mega Man 2 to find out just which game delivers the ultimate Mega Man experience. Many people will try to say 3 is the best NES Mega Man game, while many others will say the clear winner is the 2nd one. Which one do I prefer? I have played 3, and while that one was also a fun, addicting action game, I think this one tops it. It doesn't smear it, it just beats it. The level design and the weapons Mega Man can equip just excite me more in this game. The creative juices were really flowing here.Mega Man 2, despite Capcom probably not completely sure if the Mega Man name will take off or not, marks where everything fell into place for the series and it feels SO MUCH like a classic because everything about this game feels so right. Mega Man 3 feels more like just another Mega Man game"" (though a great one- it just doesn't have that special feel, though of course many would disagree).Mega Man 4 is also a good game to own, and by the time Mega Man 5 was released it felt like players were thinking to themselves ""ok Capcom, that's enough!"". But really, all 5 of those NES Mega Man games are probably worth owning. I also have never played the 6th installment. People don't seem to like that one so you may want to avoid it. From the small amount of pictures I have seen of the game, it does look different from the previous 5. Though graphics aren't everything, so who knows if I'd like it or not.I really don't have any complaints with Mega Man 2. It's a lot of fun playing this game 15 years after I first rented and eventually bought. I can't remember where I bought it. Probably a yard sale. Back in the day you could buy NES games used at yard sales, garage sales and whatnot for extremely cheap prices. Just think, there was a point where I probably would have only had to pay a dollar for the first Mega Man game. Wow, it's definitely not like that today.I'm still angry that the video store in my town always had the Mega Man 1 cardboard box on the shelf, and when I took the box up to the man behind the counter so I could rent the game, I was always disappointed to find that the game was never available because someone never returned it, and to this day I never got to play it.Mega Man 2 offers a nice challenge, but unlike many NES games it's actually possible to beat this game with some practice. That's how a challenging game should be- hard at first, and the more you play the better you get. With practice you WILL beat this game, because there's really no place in any of the levels that can be called frustrating. Just a nice small challenge all the way through.This game has it all, folks. Great level design, fantastic music, weapons and bosses that make you want to keep coming back to it again and again. There's really nothing bad that can be said about it. It's Mega Man at his most Mega Man-y. As cheesy as that sounds, it's true!""",5,a classic indeed,2005/12/15 0:00
A36UKFV79879MD,B00004SVS3,BX Lounger,2,1,"If it wasn't for the underground buzz that Mega Man received, Capcom would had most likely not released the 1989 sequel for the NES outside of Japan. If anything, it set itself up for Mega Man 2 to be a success. But not even Capcom expected how much of a success it would turn out to be: millions of copies were sold across the world and Mega Man would be quickly recognized as much as Nintendo's mascot, Mario. And when Mega Man 2 was released, the Blue Bomber returned in the breakout NES sequel that had gamers in a frenzy. I never bought it because I borrowed it from my best friend numerous times and it was worth it.Mega Man 2 had Mega Man return to save his world. Dr. Wily was really upset that he lost to Mega Man before and he vowed to get his revenge. To show he was better than Dr. Light and to crush Mega Man, Dr. Wily invented eight Robot Masters and challenged Mega Man to beat them and to fight him again. You picked one of eight stages to play through and beat the Robot Master to gain its special weapon. In addition to the special weapons, you were able to acquire three adapters that helped you cross gaps, climb walls or reach platforms out of reach. Once you beat all eight stages, you were whisked off to Dr. Wily's castle. There you had to play through six more stages, filled with more enemies, boss characters, the same eight Robot Masters from before and finally, Dr. Wily and his new robot contraptions. The game provided passwords so you could save your progress and come back later to finish your game.The PROS: Capcom responded to those gamers who felt the first game was too hard to beat by offering easy and hard modes. Because of that move, Mega Man 2 was accessible to every gamer and that helped it gain popularity. You had new Robot Masters, new weapons and more stages to play through. Everything here was better: the graphics, music, stage layouts, enemies and boss characters. The sound effects were mostly the same from the first game but were still good and so were the controls. The new weapon adapters were pretty cool and helped out in certain sections of the game. Since the game was longer, the password system was a nice addition so that you could play for a bit, copy the password and then use it later on to finish the game. Mega Man 2 was the first game to introduce energy tanks"": a health power up that filled up your energy bar when you needed it (the only catch was that you could carry up to four at a time.)The CONS: Mega Man 2 went down in the franchise's history as the easiest game in the series to beat. If you played it through the easy mode, it was an absolute but enjoyable walk in the park. But if you played it through the hard mode, the game gave you a mild challenge but nowhere near what you saw in Mega Man. Some players wanted more of a challenge besides those two modes but Capcom wanted everyone to enjoy the game so that's why it wasn't as hard as the first game. When you use the passwords, they saved your progress as far as how many robots you beat. If you used it during one of the stages in Dr. Wily's castle, the game always brought you back to the first stage of the castle. Also, the passwords never let you kept the energy tanks or extra lives you collected; you started without any energy tanks and three lives.Mega Man 2 was and still is regarded as one of the best in the NES series. To this date, it stirs the debate as to which NES Mega Man game reigns supreme and it's always been between Mega Man 2 and Mega Man 3. No matter which game was your favorite, this one had a lot of fans and brought a lot of good memories to those gamers who were fortunate enough. If you're a Mega Man fan, you have this game in some form: the actual NES cartridge, the Mega Man Anniversary Collection released for the PS2 and Gamecube consoles, or downloaded it to your Wii from the Virtual Console Service (500 points.)

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00004SVS3,S. Rhodes,5,3,"Mega Man II is perhaps the best of the original series on the NES.  It may not have a fantastic plot, but those of us who remember the NES days weren't too concerned with plot anyway (remember, you were Mario going to rescue the Princess from the clutches of King Koopa).  Mega Man II introduced a few things to the series that the first one lacked.  The biggest new assest was perhaps the Energy Tank.  While you could only carry four, it was nice that for once I didn't have to go back and forth killing enemies for energy pellets.The gameplay was a step up for this.  Mega Man II also has more balanced difficulty.  It isn't just the energy tanks, it's that you're more likely to survive in cases where you can't.  There are eight robot masters as opposed to six, and the weapons are a little better.  The element of Robot Masters being weak to other Robot Master weapons is still there, and it works out even better here than it did in the first one.  It's a bit more unpredictable.The difficulty may be balanced, but it isn't by any means the hardest of the Mega Man series (the first one is).  It's actually one of the easier ones in the series.  The bulk of the difficulty may come from Quick Man's stage, and even that can be taken care of quite easily.  Taking on the robot masters a second time is also pretty easy when you've got all their weapons to use against them, and they always drop an energy pellet that restores probably more damage than they'll do to you.  In other words, the game is not a challenge.  There are still moments where it's difficult, but for the most part, unlike the first game, it seems more managable than the first game.The music is also a lot better, and so are the graphics.  There are fewer graphical glitches, and the music gets stuck in your head for a long time.  Mega Man II is a huge step above the original Mega Man in all respects.  It plays better, it's not nearly as difficult (even on the difficult setting) and has fantastic music to boot.

You can only play as Mario and Luigi.  In Super Mario Bros. 2 you can play as the Princess and Toad in addition to Mario and Luigi.  Not so here.  In this game, Mario and Luigi don't even have anything unique to separate the two, so they are basically the same exact person (except Mario is red and Luigi is green).  Remember how high Luigi can jump in Super Mario Bros. 2?  Well now he jumps just like Mario.  Absolutely no reason for this.  If anything, Luigi should have MANY more interesting things about him this time around since, after all, Super Mario Bros. 3 comes AFTER Super Mario Bros. 2 and you'd think the most logical thing would be to continue adding MORE things with each new series.  But in this case, you get less.  I guess Nintendo FORGOT to make Luigi stand apart from Mario.Another problem: this game is so freakin' predictable.  Gee, after the desert world I go to... a water world?  You don't say!  What?  There's an ICE world and a plant world coming up?  No way!  And what's THIS I see?  The final world will be BIG DARK EVIL FIRE WORLD?  I didn't see THAT coming.  Thanks Nintendo, for making Mario fans look like complete idiots.  Way to go.Other serious problems become noticeable after a couple hours of playtime such as the fact that you have to do so much boring jumping in this game.  You have to jump on top of (or over) SO many things that it becomes an absolute chore after world 3 (if you even MAKE it that far without shutting off the game, that is).  If you find anything exciting about jumping over pipes or jumping on top of goombas or picking up and kicking buzzy beetles, then I recommend seeking professional help.Ok, what else makes Super Mario Bros. 3 suck so much?  It can't get any worse, right?  Yes it can.  After you beat the game a message comes up on the screen that says ""Thank you, but our princess is in another castle.  Just kidding, hahaha"".  You mean to tell me, after all that long, hard and tedious work making it to the very end, Nintendo is going to joke around and make like the adventure isn't over yet?  Before the ""just kidding"" part, you might very well rip apart your controller or punch a hole in your TV screen all because Nintendo wants to play around and pretend there's still more to the adventure.  I can't even think of appropriate words to describe how angry this makes me.  Tears of anger are almost dripping down my face.  Nintendo NEVER should have done that.  I bet that most people who first seen that message really thought the princess was in another castle and came THIS close to killing the nearest living thing next to them.  Bad Nintendo.And guess what?  You have to face one of Bowser's kids at the end of every world.  I'm not kidding.  I was honestly expecting to fight Bowser's WIFE before fighting him, but it never happened.  That's probably for the better.  Who knows how horrific she looks.I'm still trying to figure out what everyone sees in this game.  It's old and forgettable.  Honestly, I think nowadays the only people who enjoy Super Mario Bros. 3 are older folks whose children have moved away to college or to start a family, and they left behind their NES and Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge so their parents had something to do.  All these older folks miraculously happen to enjoy the game so now EVERYONE acts like it's the best game of all-time.  Well it's not.""",1,bad game,2006/6/27 0:00
A36UKFV79879MD,B00004SVV9,BX Lounger,0,0,"Super Mario Bros. 3 came out in 1990 at the height of Nintendo mania. Many, many, many gamers loved the Mario games for being fun to play with and this game took the franchise to a whole new level. If you haven't played this particular NES game yet, shame on you. Back in the days, I rented this game out and was blown away by the graphics, sounds and variety of levels and its challenges.Super Mario Bros. 3 lets you take control of Mario as you guide him through 8 worlds of various themes. They were all packed with stages with plenty of various challenges to overcome with the main goal being reaching and beating Bowser. What made this game remarkable was taking the essence of Super Mario Bros. and expanding it in every way possible. At your disposable, you had numerous power ups to use and many coins to collect to earn extra lives. You even had the ability to save power ups to use later in the game, which proved to be very useful. There were many secrets to uncover so it was worth playing this game over and over even if you beat it already.Get this game and pass this on to those who never tried this out and get it if you, like me, missed out on purchasing the original cartridge back then. Or you can do this: take advantage of the Virtual Console Service up and running for the Wii and download this game for 500 points(US $5.00.) It's a great deal and perfect for the new generation of video gamers who missed out on playing games for the NES.  ******HIGHLY RECOMMENDED********",5,Mario's famous third adventure,2011/10/11 0:00

This is still an incredible game no matter how old it gets. You play as Mario or if you're the second player, you play as his brother Luigi. Together... or one at a time... you take on 8 worlds or areas or lands and each land / area / world has a specific theme like ice, desert, giant, pipe or water and each has several levels. The map of each land will lead you to levels where the real game is. Each level is a sidescrolling platformer where A button is the jump, holding B will make you run, left, right and down will make you move or duck. You will soon jump on enemies to defeat them and get powerups. First the super mushroom that makes you bigger and take a second hit, then you will get the racoon leaf or fire flower. The leaf will let you bat a tail with the B button and allow you to fly if you have enough of a runway. The fireflower belts out bouncing fireballs with the press of the B button. There are other special suits and powerups like the Takooni suit, Frog suit and Hammer brother suit all with special abilities.The levels feel brief when compared to later Mario games, but they're still very fun. The land map will lead you to levels, fortresses, toad houses, special mini games to get more lives and the airship where the boss of each land is hiding. Also in the map you can use items you've collected along the way to make walking into a level easier.When its all said and done, this game has memorable levels, enemies and bosses. Fun powerups, simple yet challenging gameplay. Good graphics for the time and a diverse set of foes.

New powerups, new levels, new experiences, etc!2-Player mode was incredible compared to the one in SMB1. As you both play as Mario and Luigi, you guys can clear levels for each other (Or just die on purpose so the other player can play the harder levels), and you can battle each other in a recreation of the Mario Bros arcade game.

Now that I've cleared that up let's talk about why this is not only essential for your PS2 but why it's so much better than the one we got on the PSOne.First, this memory card has 8,000KB of space! I don't know about you but that single memory card has lasted me longer than any PSOne memory card (which I had to buy four of because that was only 15 blocks!).  The second best part is that some games can save more than one file without taking up any extra space! Some games create a file soley for the game on the memory card and I can save 15 different files no problem!  So you won't have to purchase a second memory card anytime soon.Sports games (and Socom 2) can use quite a bit of space though. Some sports games can use up 1/4 of the memory card, so watch for that. Still, you'll only use that amount once.  Socom 2...that's a different story. That takes up more than 3,000KB (just thought I'd warn ya).The problems.  Well of course, there's the list price. I only need to pay $25 for my controller so why would I want to pay nearly $40 for the memory card? Again, I'm referring to the list price NOT Amazon's price. I think the price at Amazon is quite fair.The second problem is that you can't save PSOne data onto these cards. A PSOne game won't even read them! Yet you can still copy data from a PSOne memory card to this (NOT a good idea though because you can screw up your PS2 Memory Card).If you want to enjoy your PS2 you'll HAVE to buy this otherwise forget saving and all that stuff.

The realism and depth of even the Arcade races mean GT3 is definitely suited for serious drivers only. GT2's lineup of street and off-road courses is joined by two new tracks: a cool downtown Tokyo circuit and the renowned Grand Prix course at Monte Carlo. While the car lineup is smaller than GT2's, it's still vast, offering everything from Dodge Vipers to Cooper Minis. It's a shame that more European exotic cars like Ferraris didn't make the lineup, though. However, GT3's much-vaunted A.I. isn't quite the revolution it was touted to be. Sure, the cars no longer robotically follow the same racing line and they'll occasionally sideswipe you, which are great improvements. But the changes amount to nice tuning, rather than the promised new experience. The off-road rally racing has been greatly improved, though, offering a much more playable, enjoyable ride. It's a lot like playing Colin McRae Rally 2.0-the action is that sweet. But GT3 isn't perfect. The races could really use more cars on the track; depending on the circuit, you'll face between one and five opponents. More importantly, the total absence of wrecks and damage to the cars makes such a highly realistic experience ring false at times. These nagging flaws have persisted since the first GT, so rather than being surprising, it's more of a shame that they weren't addressed.

In 2001, Nintendo started their Super Mario Advance series with this title, an enhanced port of Super Mario Bros. 2 and released it on the Game Boy Advance. Basically, they enhanced the graphics and sounds, included an intro that was not shown on the original hit and included an enhanced port of the original Mario Bros. arcade game, which can be played separately.The PROS: Just like the original NES hit, Super Mario Advance is fun to play and a perfect fit for the GBA. The enhanced graphics and sounds are nice and the controls are spot on so it's very easy to get into. When you are done playing, you can check out the other game that is bundled, Mario Bros. Originally an arcade game ported to the NES years ago, this game pits you and up to 4 players to battle it out against enemies in an underground pipes system, complete with enhanced graphics and sounds. It's more fun to play with friends than by yourself.The CONS: Well nothing else has been added but for what it is, it's still a fun game to play.Super Mario Advance is a game that should be in anyone's GBA collection. It's a great port of a classic sequel that's spot on and with extra features added, you can take it on the go whenever you want. Track this down because it is worth it.

It really is wonderful to see older games feel fresh and newly exciting again. That truly has been the case for one lucky plumber, Mario. Nintendo really has done a remarkable job of reintroducing Mario games to the Game Boy Advance audience. It has done very much wonders for a lot of people, who are now enjoying the feeling of the most groundbreaking entertainment that has ever brought games to the home. Nintendo did it originally with Super Mario Brothers, and their sequel was opposite any of the classic Mario stories that had ever been told.Super Mario Advance: Super Mario Brothers 2, is a restored version to the classic video game from the late 80's. The game features your option of one of four characters to control, Mario or Luigi, Toad or Princess Toadstool. The game is located through seven dream world stages and 20 different levels. The gameplay focuses in on a nightmare Mario has as he and his pals stop Wart and his henchmen including Birdo, Mouser, Fryguy and many shyguys from ruining the dream world Mario is stuck in. The game doesn't feature the traditional Super Mario gameplay, where instead you dig deep to pick up items to hurl at your opponents.Yet, with all the goodsides, there really are a few downsides to this game. The graphics do seem a little bit out of tune, unlike their original NES gameplay, or even the remastered gameplay from the 1993 Super Mario All-Stars compilation for the Super Nintendo. Another problem is the controls. They sometimes can make it very difficult for you to hurl bombs and vegetables when need ed at your foes. Sadly, that does bring unfortunate problems in gameplay at times.All in all, Super Mario Advance: Super Mario 2 is a great exciting twist to the original Super Mario Brothers saga.

For those that don't know, Super Mario Bros. 2 was a departure from the classic, standard setting original game, as Mario now pulled radishes out of the ground to hurl at enemies among other changes (the reason behind these is because the original Super Mario Bros. 2 was deemed too difficult when originally developed, so another in-development game got a Mario facelift and was released as Super Mario 2 here in the states, while the other Mario sequel would see somewhat of a release as Super Mario All-Stars on the Lost Levels segment), but despite it all, the game still offered some solid platforming action and fun.  Choosing to play as Mario, Luigi, Toad, or Princess Peach; you hurl radishes and other items at enemies, look for secrets, and more besides.  The game is pretty simple to get into, and the graphics and sound have been updated for the GBA, but there are some flaws.  The controls aren't as tight as we've seen on Mario games before and after this, and there are moments where the game really doesn't feel like a Mario game (and it's really not, for reasons mentioned above), but despite it's flaws, the first Super Mario Advance is a fun diversion, even though it is the weakest of the four Super Mario Advance games that came out for the GBA over it's lifespan.

We forgot to make a Mario 2 for North America!""So they made one out of Japan-only game Doki Doki Panic. And everybody liked it...until they found out what was done to make it.Super Mario Bros 2 differed a lot from the first Mario game. Mainly because of its origin. You throw veggies at your enemies, there's a mini-boss at the end of every level, you get to choose from 4 characters, and Bowser isn't the main enemy. And you know what? All that was awesome. The music and sounds were kind of what you expected in a Mario game, but note: Doki Doki Panic had the same music and sounds. Just that this is in 32-Bit.This Game Boy Advance version is a great re-release of Mario 2. It featured lots of improvements over the original. First, notice the score system. Mario 2 never kept track of score, and neither did the Super Nintendo version (in Mario All-Stars). There are also new GIANT Pow Blocks and Shy Guys. Hearts now appear a lot more often. Of course, there are now voices.The biggest difference I know is the new Yoshi Challenge after you beat Wart for the first time. You have to go around all the levels of the game, looking for hidden Yoshi eggs (Don't worry, you can select the levels). Get all 40 and then you beat the whole game. The eggs, though, are hidden in the Subspace (Where you find the mushrooms), and they are not beside the mushrooms. The Yoshi Challenge made the game's replay value go up higher.There's also a version of Mario Bros (the arcade game) included with Super Mario Bros 2. This version is also pretty updated. You can do the Super Jump from SMB2 and you can also pick up and throw Pow Blocks. You can also run, which is a bit helpful. You can also link up to play with 3 friends in co-op.Think that's enough? NOPE! There's also a 4-Player VS mode that uses Mario Bros. This time, you need to either collect 5 coins or be the last one standing to win. There are some cool items you can use, but they are found in a trash can (gross).

Upon purchasing it and playing it, all I can say is it exceeded my expectations for a Castlevania game. My only gripe with the game was that it was a tad too dark to see it good on the screen to play. Most people complain that games on the GBA are hard to see.

Castlevania:Circle of the Moon is definitely worth getting to add to your Library of games for the GBA.",5,Castlevania:Circle of the Moon definitely worth getting.....,2002/8/25 0:00
A36UKFV79879MD,B00005BJ9G,BX Lounger,0,0,"Castlevania: Circle of the Moon was a launch title for the Game Boy Advance back in 2001. It's been a few years since a 2D Castlevania game was released to the public and they were hyped to hear it was coming to the GBA. While it made an impact, this game brought mixed results that fortunately was more good than bad.Castlevania: Circle of the Moon follows a new main character named Nathan Graves on his quest to defeat Count Dracula in a brand new castle. Much like every Castlevania game so far, you control the main character and he is armed with a whip. You can pick up weapons along the way to use against the enemies and bosses. A new feature was introduced to this game: the card attribute system. You can find and acquire different kinds of action and attribute cards. When you combine certain cards together, you unlock special effects that enhance your whip or weapons to deal greater damage. This comes in handy as the game gets harder. The castle you explore is huge but not every area is accessible from the get go. Be ready to backtrack often because the items you need to help you progress further into the castle requires you to visit areas you can't get into before. When you need to take a break or want to continue your game later, look for save rooms located throughout the castle to save your progress anytime.The PROS: It's a brand new 2D Castlevania game since Symphony of the Night and Circle of the Moon is a fun game to play. It continues with the new Metroid-vania"" game play style established by the PS1/Saturn title so exploring the castle takes awhile and is entertaining as well. The controls and sounds are excellent and are perfect for highlighting what the GBA was capable of doing early on in its debut to the world. The new card attribute system works well and is fun to mix and match cards to see what effects you activate; there are so many that it will keep you busy trying to find them all as some are rare and others appear more often. This game is also challenging so at some points it will get hard but not to the point that you want to give up.The CONS: This game is dark....literally speaking. Konami went out of their way to set the mood here to make this castle you explore spooky by making every area dark; it worked too well because it is hard to see where you are going because of the lighting. And when your eyes adjust to it, you'll realize that the graphics aren't that great. They are decent but not what you expect from a Castlevania game. Because of the graphics, the animation is also lacking. While it doesn't ruin the experience, you can't help to notice how they somewhat dropped the ball in these two areas.Castlevania: Circle of the Moon made an excellent debut on the GBA and was worth picking up as one of the launch titles for the new handheld system back then. Despite its shortcomings, it a fun game that carries on the tradition that is associated with a Castlevania title. It's hard to find nowadays and it very expensive to buy it new so you are better off getting it used.

The quest leads you on a massive fantastic journey through a dark world that is full of full of mythical monsters, such as mummies, gargoyles, and the grim reaper. This game is not what I expected, from the usual whip and holly water game. This game now lets you find and equip armor, new weapons, special items, such as the double jump and the running boots. It also incorporates spells, which can be mixed and matched to make different effects, such as giving you flame whips or more energy. This game is more like Metroid (NES + SNES), being that it is a side-scrolling quest. It is a big and sometimes tediously long game, because there are countless enemies after you, but it&#65533;s a good thing there are 150 different types of enemies after you or else you will get bored very quick. One of the more difficult parts of the game is the fact that there are several areas that look exactly the same, so you can get lost easily.

This is by far the best GBA game you can buy and with good reason.  The launch title for the GBA is ranked among one of the best sellers on the GBA.It isn't hard to see why this is a loved game.  From the moment you pop this into your GBA you'll be swept off your feet by its AMAZING sound and incredible gameplay that goes unmatched by any other game out there!The game begins when three vampire hunters corner Dracula.  A master, his son and an apprentice.  The master becomes imprisoned by Dracula and drops The son and apprentice into the depths of the castle below.  Now, playing as the apprentice, Nathan Graves, you must explore the castle and find a way to get inside Dracula's chamber and stop the rite from happening!Most noticeable about Castlevania: Circle of the Moon is its music.  Anyone who's played this game can tell you that Circle of the Moon sounds INCREDIBLE!  There is no GBA game that sounds this good out there.  Some of the music is actually Orchastral and for the GBA that's amazing.The second most noticeable thing about Circle of the Moon is the gameplay.  Circle of the Moon incorporates an RPG style like gameplay.  You run around with a whip that you use to attack enemies.  For each enemy you kill you get experience points.  When you get enough you level up and your HP and MP increases.But the gold of Castlevania: Circle of the Moon is in the DSS (Duel Set-up System).  This is perhaps the most innovative game idea presented in a title like this.  There are twenty DSS cards in the game.  Those for elements, and those for attributes.  Finding all twenty isn't an easy task since the enemies drop them at random.  But incorporating this system into the game is what makes it fun.  You select one element and one attribute and see what happens.  The DSS presents about 100 combinations and some are very worthwhile to see.The other part of the gameplay that presents itself well is the exploration.  The castle you explore is huge and well constructed.  As you defeat more bosses and acquire more abilities you can explore even more of the castle.  Much like the Metroid games, you'll know when you can proceed and when you can't.  If you come to an area you can't get to its obviously because you do not have the correct ability.Castlevania doesn't have bad graphics.  For a GBA launch title the overall presentation is good but unless you have a GBA SP its a little dark.  On a normal GBA it was so dark sometimes that I'd take damage and didn't know what was hitting me.  The animation is also on the shorthand side.  But that shouldn't suggest that Circle of the Moon doesn't present itself rather well.The game is also a good challenge.  It is not an easy game to get through, and newcomers to the series will have some trouble.  But a good challenge is a good thing.  The game is not too easy but it really isn't all that hard either.  The meat of the challenge comes from the bosses and in any game that's where the challenge should come from.Perhaps the best part about Castlevania Circle of the Moon is the replay value.  Most games lack this but Circle of the Moon makes it worthwhile by providing new modes.  Each time you complete the game you unlock new modes.  Magician Mode, Fighter Mode and Thief Mode. Each mode has its own strenghs and weaknesses.  For example, in Magician Mode you start off with all the cards and a massive amount of MP but your attack, defense and HP are severely limited.  In Fighter Mode you have incredible attack, defense and HP but you don't get any DSS cards.  In thief mode you have incredible luck!  This makes playing through the game a second, third or fourth time a completely different experience than before.Castlevania: Circle of the Moon is perhaps the best GBA game out there.  With superb sound and gameplay, this is easily a treat for any gamer and Castlevania fan.  It stacks up perfectly to Symphony of the Night and more over, should be the Castlevania that all future titles on the GBA should be compared to.  An awesome effort by Konami.The Good+Great gameplay+DSS System is the best+Good challenge+Visually striking+INCREDIBLE SOUNDTRACK.

A36UKFV79879MD,B00005C7P7,BX Lounger,2,2,"Konami was one of the SNES's biggest supporters for the console back in the early '90s. They had such a presence during the NES's glory days and it only intensified later on. In 1992, they continued one of the company's best known franchises by releasing Contra III: The Alien Wars and it looked and played so well, they could have released it in the arcades and people would line up to play. They pulled out all the stops and kept the series' legendrary difficulty level intact to make sure it hit hard on the SNES.Contra III sees the return of the heroes from the previous two entries as they once again stick their necks out to save the world from Red Falcon. Yes, the nemesis of the Contra series returns once again and this time his army of aliens and deformed creatures are bigger and meaner than ever. It's a straight shoot 'em up action game where you will explore 6 stages. You can choose your difficulty level from easy to hard as well as how many lives you want to start out with and configure your controller buttons. Each stage is littered with enemies and the infamous power ups like the Spread gun, the Laser and the Machine Gun. This time around, you can wield two different guns at the time and switch them back and forth on the fly. The more enemies you shoot, the more points you rack and eventually you earn extra lies (you'll need them too.) If the action gets too intense, grab a friend for the 2 player co op mode to double your chances of beating the game.The PROS: This game looked amazing back then and it still holds up to the test of time. Contra III uses every bit of processing power from the SNES to deliver the best graphics the series has seen up to that point. The music rocks and gets you pumped to shoot enemies and destroy everything in sight. The sound effects and controls are spot on. You will not have a problem controlling your character or hearing how each gun sounds different from each other and shooting enemies and blowing up the boss characters sounds like sweet music to your ears. The 2 player co op mode means you can always get another person to play with you, doubling the fun you can have with this game.The CONS: Compared to the previous two entries, this one is a somewhat, shorter game so it might disappoint some gamers. Contra III is manageable on both the easy and normal modes. But in order to see the game's ending sequence, you had to play it on hard mode and it is brutally hard. If you can't take an intense challenge, stay away from the hard mode. Grown men have tried and were left to console themselves and even to this date, I haven't legitimately beaten the game. So you have been warned.Contra fans have already plowed through this game and very few of them have finished it on the hard difficulty level without cheating. Many will tell you that the series hit a very high point when this one came out and they are right. So for those who want to see what this game is about and are not afraid of having their game skills pushed to the limit, track down a copy of this game ASAP. You can also download this title for the Wii from their Virtual Console Service for 800 points (US $8.00) It's a game like no other from a series like no other.

It's a short game, but it's fairly addictive and easy to get into.The Red Falcon is trying to take over the world, and the only two people who can stop this even alien menace are Bill (the blue guy) and Lance (the red guy).  Contra has NEVER been about story.  It's always been about gameplay.  No matter how you look at it, and Contra III is divine.The gameplay has been brought to new heights since the NES versions.  You've got guns, super bombs you can use and to make things even better, you're able to carry two guns and switch between them on the fly, and even use both at the same time.  Graphically it was one of the first SNES games to have a stylish look, and showed us just how much you could really put on the screen at any one time.  The environments are decorative, the explosions look good, and the bosses are still some of the most detailed the Super Nintendo ever had.Contra has always been known for its difficulty, and Contra III is no exception.  Old fans of Contra, of course, remember the classic Konami cheat.  It doesn't work in Contra III, but to compensate there are difficulty levels and you can choose to start off with more lives.  Of course hardcore fans will go through the game on Hard Mode with the default 3 lives.  If you thought the first two Contra games were hard, you haven't seen anything until you've played through Contra III on hard mode.The only real drawback to the game is that it's pretty short.  It's only six stages long and the levels themselves aren't really that long.  It's got a ton of replay value to its credit, however, and fans will probably be dying to go through the game without getting hit once.  So it has some good replay value at least.  The only other drawback to the game, for Virtual Console, users is simply that while the Virtual Console version supports the Gamecube Controller, it's almost impossible to use, unless you want to find out just what ways your fingers can bend.  A Super Nintendo game was no designed to be played with a Gamecube controller.  So those downloading on Nintendo Wii's virtual console, keep in mind that without a Classic Controller, gameplay will be next to impossible.Contra III is arguably the best one in the series, with the Sega Genesis version Hard Corp competing for this position.

The nicest feature to it, are the courses, because they did not try to recreate the same old courses in the SNES and N64 versions of the game. They took ideas and concepts from Super Mario 2 and made courses from them, such as Shy Guy Ship. The old favorite courses are still in it though, like Bowser's castle and the Haunted House.

That really can be surprising from a world class video game icon like Mario. Arguably, when Nintendo developed Mario back in the 80's, he had proven to be the most successful plumber of all time. Still, the downside comes every so often, when a game does seem to actually rev up those engines today and back then, it does seem to cool down, and it has done it here a little bit too much. After the massive success of Mario Kart 64 for the Nintendo 64, Nintendo thought they had a sure hand victor again with another Mario Kart, but they were wrong.Mario Kart: Super Circuit is the first racer for the Game Boy Advance that features Mario and his gang including Bowser, Yoshi, Wario, and Princess Toadstool who is known now as Peach, and a few others. Basically, it is the same gang as it was from Mario Kart 64. The game displays 20 different tracks, that really don't seem to break out as they did before, as well as the hidden tracks from the original Mario Kart. The game is mostly like the very first Mario Kart from the Super Nintendo, without a lot to showcase. The control here is also a lot harder to go around here, and can often try to frustrate you in the process, no matter what the course is. Although it is a little bit challenging, Mario Kart may seem more like a throwback than the successor to Mario Kart 64, or even the Mario Kart: Double Dash for the Nintendo Gamecube.In all in all, Mario Kart: Super Circuit for the Game Boy Advance isn't as surprising as I thought it was. It actually seems more like another dull racer that it is on the inside, rather than the box on the outside. I only suggest this, if you haven't played the first Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo, but not if you've enjoyed the mass appeal of the other two Mario Karts.

A2TCG2HV1VJP6V,B00005MDZY,Ryan Sil. (Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...,0,0,"Mario Kart: Super Circuit is the first time the Mario Kart series came onto the Game Boy. It is also the first game in the series to have a subtitle with the actual title. Once more, it is also the first Mario Kart game to have retro courses. Don't believe me? Then skip down to the near-bottom of this review.Instead of having the same gameplay as Mario Kart 64, however, the game uses the original Super Nintendo game's gameplay and performs a major twist in it.The graphics are awesome. For the characters, they are taken right out of Mario Kart 64, but everything else is new and a sight for sore eyes.You get to start with 16 courses (The Special Cup is locked). Each course seems to have their own gimmicks, with the exception of some. The courses are greatly detailed and their designs are kinda clever.The music in the game is unlike the other Mario Kart games. Although some of the soundtrack is Mario Kart-worthy, there are several songs that doesn't fit in, yet you'd love to listen to the music. Such examples are Boo Lake, Ribbon Road, Snow Land, and the game's Rainbow Road.When racing on a track, you'll always find coins. At first glance, they look pointless to collect. But guess what? You need them. If you have no coins and someone bumps into you, you'll spin out. What's cool about the coins is that when you finish a cup with over 100 coins, you get to unlock a cup from the original Super Mario Kart! Nostalgia just beats like a human heart right there. When you enter the Cup menu, just press L or R and then it will switch to the Super Mario Kart tracks. The graphics aren't from the Super Nintendo game, though, but the tracks still play like how they used to be.With 20 new courses and 20 ones that were brought back, this game will last for a long while.",5,First time is pure awesomeness,2011/1/5 0:00
A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005ML10,B. E Jackson,4,1,"Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty is the sequel to the innovative original MGS game that appeared on the Playstation One. Even though the game is quite fun, I probably prefer the original. Here's why:- First of all, the amount of cutscenes in this game are *incredibly* high. I'd say you have TWICE as many cutscenes to deal with in this game compared to the original. True, these cutscenes might end up telling a good story (if you actually have the patience to watch them all) but it doesn't really excite me on a personal overall video game experience"" level. Years from now the only thing I will remember about Sons of Liberty will be all the cutscenes I had to sit through, or skip (if I chose to do so). To make matters worse, many times I'm interrupted with spoken conversations during critical moments where I REALLY can't afford to be interrupted, such as during a moment when I'm trying to find the best way to eliminate a guard blocking an important path. I can't be distracted during these moments, and that's a shame. This was never a problem in the original.- Sons of Liberty is just about the same length as the previous MGS game (if you choose to skip all the cutscenes, that is). I'm serious. A sequel is ALWAYS supposed to be a longer and more interesting game. However, this is not the case with the Metal Gear Solid series. I can beat this game in 2 hours and 30 minutes. I can beat the original in 2 hours and 20 minutes. So it's only about 10 minutes longer overall. I'm not happy about that at all.- The very reason the original Metal Gear Solid is a much better game overall is because of this- the boss fights. In Sons of Liberty you only have 5 or 6 boss fights total, and none of them are very creative or interesting. What's up with that? One fight has you shooting between crates trying to locate and eliminate the enemy. It's fun, but not THAT great. Certainly not sequel-worthy, in my opinion.Another boss fight has you running from the first to second level shooting stingers at the enemy. This is sort of fun. Another boss fight has Snake diffusing bombs. I don't particulary care for this one because for the majority of the first half of the game it seems like you're going around making sure bombs don't go off in certain places. I don't want to continue doing the same thing during a boss fight. It also seems like there's an exceptionally long period between the first and second boss fight.In the original you had up to 11 or 12 boss fights, and they were more creative than the ones here, too. You had a helicopter battle, a sniper fight where you had to guide missiles through a winter forest to find the sniper, a battle with a large army tank, a fight with a ninja, a really fun fight with a HUGE mechanical robot where you were required to take down the big thing with stinger missiles, and more. The boss fights in Sons of Liberty come up short and feel uninspired compared to the original Metal Gear Solid.However, the one thing this game does better is that the guards you encounter are MUCH smarter this time around. You can't just walk by them- they will easily see and kill you if you dare to attempt that. This game encourages you to find the correct way to deal with each of the guards that happen to be in your way. Sometimes you have to stun them, and drag them out of the way because other guards might walk by and spot their dead bodies, and then suddenly a search for you will go out, which would then require you to find a way to get out of there and FAST. Smarter enemies in this game are certainly a nice welcome, and probably the only thing about the game worth mentioning.Some people say that walking around in first-person view makes this game better than the original Metal Gear Solid, but I don't buy that because it seems like EVERY game nowadays has a first-person view. The original was unique.Stick with the first Metal Gear Solid game if you are given a choice between the two. It's more exciting, and thankfully doesn't feature an overkill of cutscenes in all the wrong places. That's where Sons of Liberty fails, unfortunately. Too many unnecessary interruptions. Still, it's a pretty good game. Just not the ""major improvement"" we were led to believe.""",3,not too good,2006/10/21 0:00

As Snake investigates, he gets drawn up into a huge quest. The problem with the story is that it just seems too much. You'll get double crosses, double double crosses, being told that this is the truth only later you'll discover somebody else will tell you the REAL truth and so on. Just gets confusing at the end.Graphics: Wow. How purdy. Seriously these graphics are amazing. Close-up's of Snake show his hair flowing perfectly and little things.

It seems like very soon after one cinema stops does another start up. Then right after that there's another one. Be prepared to watch a lot.Music/Sound: This score belongs in a movie, and that's a good compliment, by the way. Wow, how huge sounding. Gives it a very cinematic-epic feel to the game.

Rhodes,90,75,"As promised I'd post an actual review of the game after beating it to a pulp.Needless to say that this is an amazing game with a gripping story, and defintely a worthy sequal.  To say that it has perfect top notch graphics and music that will blow you away. Not to mention its great character development and plot twists.I won't give away any of the story where as to me (and a lot of other people) this game has some of the best Plot twist in history.  All I will say is that the game is divided into two parts.  The &quot;Tanker&quot; chapter and the &quot;Plant&quot; chapter.  They both link in everyway and you can see if you play through the game.The characters are a true treat in this game.  There are several new characters introduced and they all have their own reasons for being where they are.  However the main villian...compared to Liquid Snake isn't the best.  Next to Kefka (FFVI) Liquid was probably the best villian of all time.  In comparison, the main villian didn't live up to Liquid.The music is breathtaking done by Harry Gregson-Williams (The Rock and Enemy of the State if you don't know him).  The music will really catch you, and that intro music is just awesome!I'm not much for graphics but I will say that the graphics are so good that when watching the cinema scenes they look like real people!  Can't go wrong with that.  Also, the voice acting is sheer brilliance.  They actually show emotion and they have a change in tone when they're upset or sad.It'll take you about 10-15 hours to complete the game your first time through but it is worth it.  However, movie cinemas make up at least six hours of the game.  This may bother some people as they said the first one was short. Sorry to say that the game is NOT short.  But that means you actually HAVE TO WATCH THE CGs!!!!  Also, watching the CGs is the only way to understand anything thats going on.The game doesn't really present any BIG challenge.  In fact with the new gear and stuff you can do I'd say it makes the game EASIER than the first (is that possible!?).  To say the least though the new gear isn't much different from the old gear in MGS.Lastly the fun factor.  The game is very fun if you don't take it too seriously.  What I mean by that is don't be ashsmaed to break some of the stealth rules and have fun with the guards every once and awhile.  That was the funnest part of the first one.One final note.  In the HARD and EXTREME difficulty setting you can choose to have a game over if you're spotted.  Being that you take so much damage I'd probaly suggest that you take that oppertunity on EXTREME.OVERALLGraphics: 10Plot/Story: 10Music: 10Gameplay: 9Fun Factor: 10Overall score: 9.9You won't be disappointed",5,Now that I've played more than the Demo...,2001/11/22 0:00

Even my cousin and his friends holds weekly tournaments with linked up Xboxes. He's visiting now so he brought his Xbox and I rented this game just to see the fuss. Well now I can see what they were talking about, if only for a few hiccups.Story: Probably the biggest bad ass since Dante from Devil May Cry, Master Chief finds himself in a struggle against the Covenant, who are using a massive structure called Halo to wipe out life on Earth. On Halo is an actual environment you can walk around. On this, is a strange alien race that also wants to use Halo.Sound/Music: Like Halo 2, this game has great music you can't help getting pumped at. It's like the perfect music to kick ass with. Voice acting is nice with the still hilarious Grunts providing their battle cries. Weapons obviously sound like weapons but there's not a lot to hear besides your footsteps.Gameplay: Since I played Halo 2 first, I missed having some things. The option to duel wield is nowhere to be found and I only found myself driving a Warthog and a Ghost and a Banshee. What got annoying during play was when you get shot and your health severely goes down forcing you to recharge your shield. Unfortunately, this thing is so bad that if you were to get shot during this, it stops the recharging which is really slow giving the tension that happens in battle. I died more on this one than Halo 2, which I guess means that one's easier.The level design is seriously crappy. In one stage, I went through a room, then down a lift, to the same damn room, down a corridor, down another lift, through the same room again! And this happened very often. Even when I thought it was done, there was STILL this same thing(you'll notice the arrows and the circular rooms, these rooms will repeat a lot). The other noticeable complaint is the lack of a map. I wandered around so many times hoping to find out where I'm going but Nav points, helpful indicators only happen so often, which means barely.Again, can't comment on multiplayer but I hear it's fun so I'm sure that's fun too.",5,Probably the best launch title since Mario 64,2005/1/25 0:00

It shines in just about every aspect - graphics, replayability, enjoyability, intelligence of your in-game friends and enemies, even plot!You're working with the humans against the Covenant, on a ringworld much like many other ringworlds in Sci-fi. You often work with a team of marines against the enemies, and the marines actually work like a unit! They'll run down halls with you, laying covering fire. If the group is up against nasty odds, some marines will start worrying. If you're doing well and you snipe someone a marine was aiming at, they'll complain!There are lots of different weapons, each with its own fun attributes. When you're holding a weapon in your hand, you can see by its counter or the needles sticking out of it how much ammo is left in it. There are jeeps and other vehicles you can drive, and if you get near a marine, they'll jump in to help you out! Jeeps climb over terrain quite realistically, and if you flip one, you can even try to flip it back over.The graphics are just amazing. From the way the different missile types fly over the terrain, to the terrain itself, to night vision and zoom-in-sniper-rifles to the details on the enemies, it's truly like watching an animated feature come alive. The water ripples. The drop ships fly overhead - complete with shadow rippling over the landscape - and when they set down, you can watch as they open and the aliens inside come out. And start shooting you immediatley :)The whole interplay of plot and characters is great. One alien type is a little creature that runs around laughing, unless it feels threatened, in which case it waves its arms over its head and runs away yelling &quot;help! help!&quot;. When a marine shoots one, sometimes he'll call out &quot;Who's laughing now?&quot; or other such jibes. Very little is &quot;contrived&quot; in this game. You really get a sense that you're moving forward with a purpose, and that your team is THERE with you.And, even better, you can multiplay in a way which is REALLY fun! With two players you still get a lot of screen space, and you can easily work as a team - flanking an enemy, coordinating attacks. Your marines will see this and help out.

What's Not to Like: Getting used to the controller rather than a mouse/keyboard combo. Every home in America that has an Xbox should not go without Halo.  Microsoft acquired Bungie in order to get this game on Xbox, and after playing it, you can definitely see why. First off, you'll notice the somber music and graphics.  The graphics are amazing-as in better than what you've seen on a PC.  They are just incredible to look at and you'll drool in awe. Now, let's talk about the gameplay: in the beginning you'll awake from your cryo-sleep and you'll have to knock out the cobwebs by re-training your systems.  (What a great way to do a tutorial).  Then you'll see one of your fellow crewmen get killed as the evil Covenant troops overrun your ship.  Next you'll have to get off the ship, but of course the Covenant are after you-and boy are they smart.  You'll have other troops with you helping your cause and they actually protect you with covering fire and suppressing fire. You can hide behind obstacles and take cover, but in later missions, you are attacked from above so be careful.  You are only allowed two different weapons to carry at one time and boy you'll find a huge number of weapons to choose from, adding another strategic element to the game.  Grenades aren't considered a weapon so you also have them in your arsenal.  Weapons are as lame as an 'energy pistol' and move up to more impressive guns, such as a very cool sniper rifle that lets you zoom in up to 10x and really pick your targets. Of course you don't have to go in all guns a blazin', instead you can also sneak attack and take out some of the Covenant baddies.  The sounds these guys make can help you out in order to determine their location, especially with the bad guys I like to call clowns, and when you play the game, you'll see why I call them that. The levels of the game are incredibly deep and there's no one way to finish a level, which adds immensely to the replay value.  The game is very challenging as the Covenant soldiers don't act the same way twice, and I mean that in a good way: they react to where you are and what you are doing. Halo isn't just a first person shooter-in fact you'll also have to do a bit of driving of certain vehicles in order to get where you want to go.  The Warthog is a nice vehicle with one problem-the gun is in the back.  Since you can't be in two places at the same time, you should go on a quest and find some other troops that have crashed in the forest so they can operate the gun.This is the great thing about Halo-the missions make a heck of a lot of sense and you'll enjoy your time playing it. While I enjoyed my time in a single player quest, a multiplayer split screen option is also available (sorry, no internet play yet).  Everything looked smooth and enjoyable in the cooperative mode as well.  You can link multiple players and Xboxes together using the system link, but I'm not sure how many will take advantage of this.

You can drive around big cities, get out of your car whenever you want, and shoot anybody at any time, and have cops hot on your trail. Here's my stack on this game:Graphics: 7/10. The graphics are not good. They are very blocky and overall pretty painful to look at until you get used to it. Some effects are good though, such as when cars explode. These graphics were probably considered fairly good in 2003, but now they are just sub-par.Sound: 8.5/10. The sound is awesome. Awesome radio stations, people screaming, great sound of rain hitting the pavement, the guns sound great, everything is pretty good soundwise in this game; just not the best.Control: 8/10. I am a SOCOM player and I like to use the analog sticks at the same time to move, and I like to use R1 to shoot; but that's not the case here. You can move with two analog sticks, but it's not very easy to do, and isn't worth doing anyways. The cars all steer differently and drive differently, which adds to more realism; which is extremely cool, and there are a lot of different cars depending on which island you're on.Fun: 8/10. This is a great game; the best in the series; and I have great fun with it, and this game doesn't seem to get old. Sure there are times when it will make you want to put it down for awhile, but you'll start playing again whenever you want to take your anger out on something.( Note: This game is rated 'M' and is not intended for people under the age of 17. )Even though I'm 14. ;)",5,The Best GTA Game,2005/11/12 0:00

The driving is simple, easy and a lot of fun. One button to go forward, one to go backward, directional pad left and right to steer, a button to get out and so on. The action part is simple as well, directional pad to run, hold one button to take aim with a gun and another to shoot. There is a jump, run and a button to get into vehicles.Grand Theft Auto 3 is a mission based game yet it is very open world / sandbox. You take on one mission at a time, anything from driving someone from point A to B to slaying a gang or killing someone. Needless to say this is a violent game (guns, blood, car slaughter) with harsh language, drinking and so on. The missions in this game are relatively simple compared to future Grand Theft Auto games like Vice City and San Andreas. Missions are given by characters that are easy to find. The voice acting is good and your character has no voice, so the missions are mostly being ordered around. When you're not in a mission, you can take side missions like driving a taxi, vigilante in a cop car and driving an ambulance.The random fun comes from the sandbox like world. When you commit crimes your wanted level raises, when you have a higher wanted level different forces chase after you. Police, swat, FBI, and the army. Traffic patterns, pedestrials and gangs all contribute to the random chaos that can add to the excitement and enjoyment of your missions or even walking around.There are a few types of weapons, pistols, shotguns, explosives and rifles. But you can only hold one weapon of each type at a time. The vehicles are nice and you can only drive four wheeled vehicles, which is fine, but if you played Vice City before this... it is a step backward.In all, this game is a good game and at the time it was fantastic, but then Vice City and San Andreas came out that surpass this game by leaps and bounds. GTA 3 doesn't have the personality, charm, liscensed music and fun as Vice City or San Andreas.

Stock car racing is for adults, for example, and paintball isn't intended for 6 year olds. In the same manner, Grand Theft Auto 3 isn't meant for your 4 year old niece. It's a game deliberately geared towards the millions of adult gamers who make up a large segment of the gaming population.The game taps into the current love of shows like The Sopranos and movies like The Godfather and Goodfellas. Sure, we know that the mob causes harm. But we still love to watch and read about them, and we can feel understanding as they fight to maintain their own style of honor and family while other groups try to muscle in.You start out as a bank robber who was betrayed by his girlfriend. Sprung out of a police convoy through a lucky situation, you and your new friend, 8-Ball"", are starting out in the world of crime. A member of the local mafia asks you for some simple help ferrying a girl around. Taxi service, really. But when you do a good job, the requests get more complex ... and more rewarding.This game is impressive on many levels. First, there's the basic graphics. It's a fully immersive world that you can walk around on, much like EverQuest. But instead of forests and glades, it's a fully realized city, complete with bridges, subways, pedestrians, cars, vans, even police helicopters. Everything is interactive. Jump in a car, drive down a few blocks, hop out, walk on the pedestrian walkway. Your world is huge, and each area (Chinatown, etc) has its own character.The vehicles have different models, the world cycles from dawn to day to dusk to night. Street lights come on, signs glow. Traffic lights cycle green to red, and you have to pay attention to what you're doing. Other drivers aren't always paying attention to the lights, especially when they're in the middle of a chase. So defensive driving is definitely the order of the day.There are many different gangs that the mafia are bumping up against - the Columbians, the Yakuza, and many more. Each have their own turf, their own preferred cars, their own radio stations they tend to listen to! The missions you take on start to get you involved with the different gangs as well as other small-time hoods.Sure, this game isn't about helping elderly widows walk to church each Sunday through a grassy lane. It's about taking on jobs to bring entertainment to the cops for their Policeman's Ball as quickly as possible. It's picking up a double-crosser so the boss can talk with him. But one of the pleasures of gaming, just like any other form of entertainment, is that it lets you imagine worlds that you don't normally enter.In Dungeon Keeper you played the part of the ""nasty"" overlord, out to stop those goody-goody elves and paladins from stealing your treasure. In the various Command & Conquer games you could choose to be the good guys, or you could choose to be the bad guys. In games of Cops & Robbers, someone is always the Robber.

AQMWZIH22R6LE,B00005O0I2,"TwistaG Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore""""",5,5,"Grand Theft Auto has been a favorite series for many gamers, not only because of the quality of the series, but because of the game's shocking over-the-top violence.  Being an extremely gruesome game for its time, the original Grand Theft Auto was ridiculed by politicians and parents alike as being violent and inhumane.  But this didn't stop Take 2 Interactive.  The controversial remarks only added to the series' success as the first two original games have sold well over expected sales.  (Remember, any publicity is good publicity.) The series' third outing builds on to the formula which made its predecessors so popular and throws it all into a 3D world.  The top down view is replaced by a more traditional 3rd person view and the graphics have been greatly improved and made to look more `real' than the past two titles.  Furthermore the game is much more storyline-based and the missions have become center-stage rather than just something extra to do if you have time.  The GTA series has truly evolved. The game begins with an opening cinema showing you and your girlfriend in the middle of a bank robbery.  But it's a set-up.  Your girlfriend pops a shot into you and runs off with the money as you're lying on the ground with a gun in your hand.  The cops come soon after and throw you in the back of their van ready to haul you off to jail.  As the van is en route something happens but I'll let you find out what that something is for yourself. After the `something' happens you find yourself at Luigi's, the first person that will give you some things to do in your new life.  The opening mission involves picking up a girl and taking her back to Luigi's.  The real beauty of this game is that this can be done in so many ways.  You could steal a taxi and go straight to picking her up or you could carjack a Banshee and cruise around a bit before meeting up with her.  After you complete your objectives whatever they may be you are given another mission. Although Rockstar has made the missions more of a priority, you are allowed to do whatever you please in between missions so the game never gets stale.  It's amazing how huge the game world is. Liberty City actually feels like a living breathing place.  Hundreds of people crowd the sidewalks and dozens of cars stop at red lights and turn at intersections.  The best part is that you can interact with all of it.  Want to blow up a car at the corner of 5th street and 2nd? Go ahead.  Want to attack some old ladies walking in front of a payphone in Chinatown? Fine. Keep in mind that this means this game is not for children.  You can run over innocent pedestrians walking down the street, ram a semi-truck into the back of a station wagon until it blows up, or walk down the street pumping out shotgun shells and never really get penalized.  Yes, you will be attacked by the police if something like this happens, but this, more often than not, just results in more bloodshed.  If the words Grand Theft Auto"" create a picture in your mind of someone doing something that benefits society than you need your head checked. The visuals in this game are absolutely superb.  Everything has somewhat of a cartoon feel to it and it works.  The game is streaming off the disc so most load times are usually less than five seconds.  And even if Liberty City is so huge, the frame rate only very rarely suffers.  Likewise, the sound is great as well.  Rather than having a set soundtrack, GTA3 features digital radio stations.  Each station covers a different variety of music and is complete with a DJ and commercials.  I love this because it enables you to listen to what you want when you want. Have I mentioned the great voice acting yet? The voiceovers are done by some of Hollywood's best including Joe Pantoliano, Robert Loggia, and Michael Madsen.  This makes the game all that much better and definitely gives it a more polished feel. Beyond all the cool missions and the gigantic landscape, GTA3 gives us tons to do.  There are hidden packages to be found all over the city.  Secret missions can be opened up by jacking certain vehicles.  The game also keeps track of all your kills and other statistics, such as your best ""stunt"" in an automobile.  The driving system is in itself fantastic, as all the different cars have a different feel to them, and they break apart in ways no other driving game has done. Although extremely violent and bloody, GTA3 is one of those games that you actually feel like you're a part of.  Every component of the game fits together like a puzzle and combines to engulf you in an amazing experience.  No other game can match Grand Theft Auto 3's ambition.  Rockstar set out to make a worthy successor to the series, and they not only succeeded but created one of the best games I have ever had the pleasure of playing.""",5,Can't wait until Vice City hits!!![.],2003/7/16 0:00

Has a launch title, Luigi's Mansion shows off some of the Gamecube's power but the gameplay itself leaves something to be desired.Story: Luigi wins a mansion in a contest he doesn't even remember entering. He tells his brother Mario to be there. Mario in effect has gone missing and there's ghosts all over. But thanks to Professor Gadd and his Poltergust 3000, Luigi can vacuum up the ghosts Ghostbusters-style.Graphics: The best usage of the Gamecube's engine is in the lighting and shadow. Lightning strikes through windows provide perfect shadows as well as your flashlight shining the dark rooms. Everything else looks rather blah. Besides Luigi and the ghosts, the rooms looks almost unfinished and somewhat blurry in some cases.Music/Sound: Barely any music beside a slight reprise of the classic Mario dungeon theme. When you vacuum in a ghost, there's this irritating piano figure, it's literally one note repeated. As for voices, Professor Gadd talks in a faux Japanese almost as it sounds like it but way to short to be japanese, and by pressing B, Luigi cries out Mario?"". His health plays a role in how confident or scared he sounds.Gameplay: The control scheme for this is awkward. Shoulder L is for element firing, R is for the vacuum and the grey buttons are for your Game Boy Horror, which shows either your map or a scanning feature(almost similar to Metroid Prime's). To turn the flashlight on is A, directly beneath it is the right analog which determines where Luigi faces.The stumble at the finish line reference in my subject refers to the final boss. I won't spoil who it is or anything but I'll say what happens: you take on King Boo(this isn't really a spoiler) who's inside a big...thing. Anyways, to suck up King Boo you have to fire these big spiky rocks at the thing's mouth while it's attacking but he gets so close to you, the resulting explosion ends up damaging you. Once you hit him, King Boo flies out and you have to suck him in. He literally has 500 HP...compared to your 100. Not only that, while you're trying to suck him in, the thing is firing ice at you.This is an incredibly unfair fight. It's like the difficulty was evenly balanced throughout the game then bam, frustration alley. I'm no Johnny-come-lately newbie when it comes to gaming but I took well over 4 tries to beat the guy.

While everything always has to be around Mario, this prime example focuses in on Mario's brother, Luigi. Still, this is just the 2nd game Luigi has actually starred in, the first one was Mario Is Missing!, but this game is also like it. It was a big move for Nintendo to finally start the Gamecube platform games off with Mario's Brother, and boy is it compelling.Luigi's Mansion, the debut platform game for the Nintendo Gamecube, focuses in on Luigi, getting an flyer claiming he won a contest he didn't enter, and now he finds out that he has to hunt down the infamous King Boo, and all of his ghoulish pals to stop Luigi from rescuing Mario. The game has well over 60 rooms to choose from, with a whole number of details awaiting in the process, including puzzles, and the feel of the game.

Great FMV moments including the Zanarkand attack, the group travelling through the city through a holograph and a little romantic meeting in a moonlit pond. In-game graphics are great too, although mouth movements are off. Speaking of which....Sound/Music: The first Final Fantasy to feature voice acting....and it blows. The characters sound so lifeless as if the actors just read the lines. Tidus sounds like he's a 12 year old immature boy, Yuna sounds BORED and Wakka plays the stereotypical Jamaican. The music isn't bad, but I can't remember any of it, unlike VII's score.Gameplay: MAJOR revamps. The Active Time Battle menu is gone, in its place, a meter to the side which shows who's turn is it and coming up so you won't have to make rash decisions about whether to cure or attack. You can switch in characters who aren't up to snuff or not adaptable to that enemy: Auron hits the enemy hard but is slow, Tidus is fast, Wakka is the only one who can hit airborne enemies etc.And there's the completely gone Level system. You know: get so much EXP, gain a level? It's gone. In it's place is the Sphere Grid, a massive spiderweb-like maze that when you gain a sphere level, you move one. It seems great and all but poses a problem: how would you know you're tough enough against a boss if you have no idea if you are? So it's trial and error basicallyDespite those minor mishaps, it's got quite a fairly interesting story, gorgeous graphics, and a new spin on the series in case you got sick of the last ones",5,The serie's beautiful entrance into PS2,2003/11/22 0:00

This game does just about everything right, improving on the previous games and keeping the parts that make the game so incredibly enjoyable.First, the storyline. This isn't just a hack-and-slash game - you really do start to get to know the various characters, each with their own personalities and personality quirks. None of the characters are perfect - Tidus is a little petulant, Wakka a bit closeminded. But as time goes on, they learn, grow, get from a disparate bunch of individuals to a really well integrated group.The addition of voice dialogue is rather neat, although it does get a little strange in some scenes. In general it does add to the sense that this is a live movie - especially during the GORGEOUS cut-scenes. As an anime fan, this is the sort of stuff I used to go to art movie houses to watch!Where in the last game (FFIX) they required you to play card games to move through the game, this time the game of choice isn't required. Blitzball is like water soccer, and the scenes of it are truly amazing. You can play if you want to get one of the characters better weapons, but if it's not your style, you can ignore it as well. The choice is yours!The world is really well put together, with the various culture and their art styles and architectures. It's great fun moving from deserts to mountains to water worlds. The game moves smoothly, letting you learn as you go. It's pretty unidirectional so you don't get wildly lost while you're learning. Near the end, you gain the ability to go whereever you want, and explore at your leisure.You easily stay entertained for weeks and weeks (if not for months) because there are so many side quests and mini-games that you can play right before the final battle. Just put off the end battle as long as you want, building up your characters and the world in which they live.

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00005TNI6,S. Rhodes,32,25,"Yes, this game was amazing and had gorgeous graphics and even a good storyline to boot (no FFVII though.).  The game sheds a lot to be desired such as plenty of side quests, secrets and mini games.  The music is loveable, the characters memorable.  The problem where this game falls short is replay value and gameplay.The game's graphics are truly amazing and are by far some of the best we've seen on the PS2.  The textures and mapping is great, and this is the first Final Fantasy game to be in a completely 3 dimensinal world and I mean entirely!The characters in the game are memorable with great developement and personality.  You have characters with mystery and characters with intrigue. A small love story in there. I feel however that Square didn't focus enough on the love story as much as they did in Final Fantasy VIII.  Not a bad thing, though when the kiss came it was just a couple of hours before the end of the game.The games involement is much better than in ANY other previous FF game.  Raising characters is entirely different from the series.  Now you must make your characters obtain &quot;Sphere Levels&quot;.  This was probably the best idea since the Job System introduced in FFIII or the Materia system in FFVII.  Either way, instead of gaining EXP. like your traditional RPG, you gain ability points to help your sphere level go up. Once it does it starts over and keeps building up. Once you gain a sphere level you have to move on the &quot;Sphere Grid&quot; and actually use that sphere to learn an ability, increase your stats etc.  Not a bad idea though this does bring the difficulty down by a whole lot and makes it successful to beat the game in 25 hours (and there are some who don't even increase their stats they just learn the abilities.)The battle system is different from previous FF games. Since Final Fantasy IV we've all grown used to the ATB battle system. Now you have the CTB system.  This means, Control Turn Based.  Basically its a turn based battle system with a twist.  You can switch characters in and out of battle. You also have a CTB guage that appears in the upper right hand corner of the screen. This'll show you when enemies attack and when your characters attack.  Should you select a spell like &quot;Slow&quot; or &quot;Haste&quot; you'll see what the adjustments do on the CTB guage.  The problem with this is the same as the sphere grid, the game is too easy with this. The ability to switch characters in battle is also a good idea but again, too easy.The game's downfall is the gameplay and replay value.  The game moves at such a slow pace with cinematic scenes in which more than half you're unable to skip. They don't last long but they come every ten minutes or so and that time does add up.  Thus, this makes the game lack for replay value.  The game also has predictable plot twists, but none the less its a good storyline.Also, while the music is lovely, the voice acting isn't too good. It'd have been much better if Square had let us choose whether we want subbed or dubbed.  The voice acting is in deed nothing special.The game cleary doesn't give off too much difficulty and while it is an amazing game, it is by far the most &quot;different&quot; Final Fantasy in the series.  The classic blue background is gone (some people actually DO care about that).  The classic ATB battle system that we've all grown to love is also gone.  Not to mention that as the Final Fantasy series goes on the games get easier and easier.  This one is no exception. Its downright easy.Overall the game is pretty good. It is better than VIII and IX but it isn't better than VII and the ones before.  The series has lost some of its classic edge with this one but that by no means suggest you should degrade it.On the positive side+Smooth lavish graphics+Nice music+Great storyline+New battle system that allows more strategy+The most unique way to raise characters ever+Square finally got some voices+Lots of mini-games and sidequestsBut on the bad side-Not enough replay-Too many scenes of watching rather than playing-VERY easy game-Its actually short compared to today's standards-The voice acting is not the best-Some of the elements that made Final Fantasy &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; are gone...Overall this is one of the better Final Fantasy games. Those who've ben there since FFI may not like this one quite as much but I assure you this is a great game.",4,One of the finer Fantasies.,2003/5/23 0:00
A36UKFV79879MD,B00005UK88,BX Lounger,0,0,"Super Mario World was originally released as the pack in game when you bought the Super Nintendo Entertainment System back in 1991 and set the world ablaze. It is regarded as one of the best video games ever and still holds up after all these years. In 2002, Nintendo continues their Super Mario Advance"" series by releasing a port of the classic SNES title under the name, Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2. It's a spot on port with some updates such as an intro not included in the original title, the inclusion of the Mario Bros game from the first Advance title, Luigi as a playable character and some unlockable settings after you meet certain conditions.The PROS: It's exactly like the classic SNES game so the graphics, sounds, music and controls are just like you remembered. The updates add more spark to the game overall and it makes the fact that you can take it on the go even better.The CONS: The Mario Bros game that comes with this title is exactly like the one from the first Super Mario Advance title so you're not missing anything. It would have been nice if they added more game play function but they didn't and it's better to play it with some of your friends than by yourself. A minor gripe but I had to speak upon it.If you missed your chance the first time getting this game for the GBA, then you'll have to search for it. Unfortunately, there is some serious price gouging for this particular title so unless the price is not high, get a used copy instead. Alternatively, you can get the original off of the Virtual Console service for $8, which is a fair price. Either way, Nintendo fans own this for one reason only: because it's fun to play and if you missed out, this port is worth hunting down. I highly recommend it so get your copy!""",5,The excellent port with some updates comes to the GBA,2011/5/18 0:00
A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005UK88,"Cloud ...""""",4,4,"There's pretty much a debate on the best Super Mario game: Super Mario 3, Super Mario World or Yoshi's Island(but you control Yoshi instead). Some might say Mario 64 but the lack of gameplay moves doesn't hold a candle to the many gameplay mechanics each one of the 3 provide. So we delve into one of them: Super Mario World.Story: What little story there is. As usual, Princess Peach gets kidnapped(I swear that b**** needs bodyguards or take up karate or something). So it's up to Mario to save the day as he traverses worlds in caves, the chocolate level, underwater and in the air.Graphics: This is Super Nintendo graphics so granted these aren't stunning anymore. But it does have a nice vibrancy to it and the variety of the levels adds some nice changes to the scenery without being too repetitive.Sound/Music: I often call Nintendo good support music. Besides the Mario theme, nothing is really hummable yet it doesn't feel out of place. They added some voices for Mario and Luigi which as usual get annoying.Gameplay: I remember playing this on the SNES and I was so happy I cleared all 96 stages, got the Star Road finished, the secret areas and everything. Now I have to do it again, ugh. All the levels are here with some minor tweaks.It was this one I believe they introduced one of Mario's famous sidekicks: Yoshi, the green dinosaur who likes to eat anything and s**t it out and makes eggs that he can fling at people(only in Yoshi's Island and maybe some others). He also turned into a different colored Yoshi depending on what he ate. So red turtles gave him abilities to shoot fireballs while one enabled him to fly and another gave a slight earthquake quality when he bounced.Mario 3 wins in turns of transforming Mario. In 3, he had the tanooki suit(that raccoon), the frog suit, that shoe, not to mention the fire flower and the leaf, capable of making him fly. With this one he gets the fire flower and the feather, giving him a yellow Superman cape where he can fly. It's different than the leaf cause that just made him soar straight up while here you can fly across. He can glide down by just holding the button while in 3 you had to repeatedly hit it.The Mario Advance ports are great for us old school gamers who remembers playing Chrono Trigger, Uniracers and Final Fantasy III(officially VI but that's another story).

For those of you who have played Super Mario World for the Super Nintendo, nothing big has changed, but there are 100s of details which have improved, which most people would never notice, such as the ability to save anywhere (because this is portable), more sound effects like the voices of Mario and Luigi and also hold 999 lives! An amazing new feature is the colored Yoshi's! Once you find a colored Yoshi in the hidden Special World, you can find them everywhere at random. The graphics however are not as bold and bright as Super Mario World, instead they are light and dull. The sound really is not up to par with the original game either. There are new controls as well, such as the jump and run are still the A and B buttons, but now the spin jump is the R button. There are also new intros and finishes to the game.

They have started to reissue some of their most classic games onto the Gamecube, and Game Boy Advance. Still, that does make it into a whole new game. The Mario Brothers legacy has remained that constant.

In this game, Bowser is at his old tricks again, and you and Luigi, and Yoshi have to encounter all different kinds of outrageous feats, and courses, which really test your strength and skill.

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00005UK88,S. Rhodes,7,7,"One of the greatest SNES games of all time comes to the GBA in this re-release. Super Mario World for some actually came with the Super Nintendo so I've no doubt people have played it before.  It's still a classic years later and not much really holds it down.The graphics are about the same as they were on the SNES.  Some of them look smoother and more lavish than they did before. Other than that there is no real different that you'd take direct notice to in the graphics of this game.  The game moves at faster speeds as well, but again nothing you won't remember from the original SNES release.The gameplay is also more or less the same.  A few differences are clear, such as the game is now only one player and not two.  You still select levels that you want to go to.  If it has a yellow mark there is only one exit and therefore the level is straight forward.  If the mark is red that means there is more than one exit in a level.  This allows more exploration than that of Super Mario Brothers 3.  You'll find many different ways to go through levels, eventually finding all 96 exits.I'm assuming we all know the power-ups but let's review. The super mushroom of course turns a small Mario into Super Mario.  The flower gives him flower power and the feather lets him and smack people with his cape.  Mario can also exececute spin jumps to kill enemies.  Simple gameplay that hasn't changed much from previous Mario games.My con with the gameplay is that the game has been toned down and made easier.  Things that would normally kill you in one hit rather you were big or small (Such as the spikes in Castle 6) no longer do that.  Also, I remember in the SNES version that when you were hit by an enemy while you were Flower or Cape Mario, you were instantly small again.  In this one if you have a feather or  flower power up then you instantly go back to Super Mario and then you'll have to be hit again to go back to small Mario.  Amazingly enough that one thing brings the difficulty of the game down greatly.  There are power ups in every other box.The story in this is that Bowswer has kidnapped Princess Toadstool and Yoshi's friends.  Each world has a castle that you must destroy by defeating the castle boss. Defeating the boss rescues one of Yoshi's friends.  Once you find all of Yoshi's friends you can take the battle to Bowser himself.Mario World is a rather large game.  There is no one set path to complete this game in.  It's possible to complete the game after finding as littls as 12 exits if you're good enough. That's because there are warps in certain worlds that take you to others with little hassle.Oh yeah the original Mario Bros. is on this one but if you have the first Mario Advance or any other one you'll probably ignore this one.To sum it all up, Mario World is a Mario game worth playing. You'll find yourself playing it again and again and the 96 exits will keep you busy for a while.  Great game! Worth the buy if you don't have it on SNES.",5,Super Mario World is a nice treat.,2003/11/24 0:00
A2582KMXLK2P06,B000066JRN,B. E Jackson,9,0,"Super Mario Sunshine is now considered the weak point of all the big name Mario titles, and for good reason- it's really lousy in several key areas.  Almost all of them in fact.  For those of you that grew up with the 2D Mario games, this game will feel lifeless and dramatically different in comparison.  For those of you who approached Mario with the Galaxy series... you'll have the same reaction.  The lowest point of the Mario series is Super Mario Sunshine, unquestionably.Let's name all the problems-The entire theme of the game, with the exception of a few platform-dominated missions underground along with a ghost house maze area, is based around the beach.  The ONE environment that feels totally out of place for a Mario game (the beach) and Nintendo actually thought it would be a good idea to roll with it.  REALLY disappointing.  I'm totally used to the Mushroom Kingdom by this point and expected as such.  I'm pretty sure most Mario fans feel the same way.  Incredibly disappointing that Nintendo abandoned the Mushroom Kingdom for something so generic.  Nintendo should have executed a beach theme only occasionally like how it's properly done in Yoshi's Island and Super Mario Galaxy, and then added more diverse locations for the other 90% of the game because the way it stands now, the beach is seriously overkill.  Not to mention all the yucky beach music that makes me sick after a while.  Variety is a key component of the Mario series.It's pretty sad that the underground platform jumping missions are the high point of the game because jumping on platforms is normally a chore in 3D Mario, having to line up and carefully execute well-timed jumps.  It's awful.  Platform jumping was awful in Super Mario 64 but at least the environments in that game are a tad nicer/more diverse than the overdone beach theme here.  Eventually you arrive to platforms that either disappear or square shaped cube-like rotating platforms that are unique the first time you deal with these, but ultimately adds more to the frustration factor instead of actually being fun or adding anything to the replayability.  The only time these platform missions become somewhat entertaining is when you have to collect 8 red coins with a timer requiring the player to move swiftly.  These are challenging and fun.Mario has a spray nozzle and a rocket nozzle.  The spray nozzle is a horrible idea because the object is to fill up with water at every available opportunity and spray most of the bosses until they die, which is clearly NOT what makes many of the other games in the Mario series so incredibly fun to play.  Absolutely no way.  Basically you spray bosses until they die while dodging attacks.  Sometimes this is hard when the surrounding danger gets intense, but most of the time it's painfully easy.  The rocket nozzle is slightly improved however, because this allows you to launch into the sky really high and reach the platforms that would otherwise be impossible to reach.My least favorite part of the game is a 5-way tie.1- the lifeless, empty and boring levels with hardly any enemies or exciting powerups anywhere.  Trees, beaches, water, tightropes, platforms, rinse and repeat.  For 10-20 hours.  God...2- the collect 100 coins to get a shine"" missions (the shines are the same thing as the stars found in SM64 and the Galaxy series by the way).  Several of these missions, namely that one God awful watermelon-pushing stage, takes FOREVER to obtain 100 stars.  If thoroughly exploring lifeless environments is supposed to qualify as fun and the reason many Mario fans make such a big deal about open world exploration, count me out.  Collecting these stars means Nintendo is FORCING me to explore these generic and boring environments.  Nooo way.3- having to go back to the *same exact stages over and over again* to search for/obtain MORE shines.  Where's the darn level variety?!?!?  Maintaining a beach theme is bad enough, but at least make each stage *different* for crying out loud.  Come on Nintendo, Super Mario Sunshine isn't progress- it's a kick in the rear-end.4- collecting over 200 boring blue coins, many of which can be found by spraying water on these X's located on walls that you will often stumble upon.  The reward for collecting so many of these bland blue coins isn't exciting for the player in the end so expect the highest level of disappointment imaginable.  Collecting blue coins ends up being a needless chore not only because the reward is underwhelming, but because the concept itself is unexceptional.  No real desire or motivation to obtain them.5- the overworld I guess you can say, where you spend a good chunk of your time throughout the ""adventure"", is nothing but generic buildings disguised as MORE generic platform jumping with ugly characters everywhere.  How horrendous.Oh and the storyline?  Mario goes to jail?  Give me a break.  Never *ever* attempt to implement storyline bits in a Mario platformer.  The ""princess is kidnapped/kill Bowser"" storyline is pretty weak admittedly, but honestly that's *all* we need.  Don't even think about making a story anymore elaborate than that or it will fail, which is why Super Mario Sunshine's story fails so miserably.I highly recommend skipping this game.""",2,"yup a 2, wow this is awful",2013/9/26 0:00

Still, it has been a long voyage that really never seems to end, although it has lasted only 20 years and thensome. From his beginnings with Donkey Kong, and all the way to the spin-offs that don't have anything to do with anything outside of action. Still, every which way Nintendo has gone with another conjured Mario game, it just keeps getting better and better. Still, it was a very big surprise not to release a Mario game as the debut of Nintendo's Gamecube, a similiar move just like the old days of video games in the 1980's. Still, there always can be more than meets the eye with Mario.Super Mario Sunshine, is a whole bit similar than Super Mario 64 back in 1996. Unlike the previous game, Mario is a little bit complicated to control, but it has a lot of the same effects and moves that Mario had before, except the twists with the Fludd waterpack. The game is around Mario being accused of destroying the landscape around Delfino Plaza, and all the other sevral worlds. It really isn't Mario, it is a shadow demon, who looks like Mario. The game evoloves around much fewer worlds as the successor, to Super Mario 64. It is worth the challenge, but does fall back a little bit as being as strong, and challenging. The game does also feature some other feels, including cleaning, and shooting critters and other things with the water cannon. The game does take a whole lot of time to get used to, especially when it comes to trying to make all those camera angles accurate, which also hurts in the forward motion. However, the graphics and the feel of the game is much the same and a little bolder than Mario 64. The game does feature new challenges, but can be a little bit compliacted at first, including a pachinko machine mini-game, and extreme bosses including Petey Piranha and the infamous King Boo, from Luigi's Mansion.Although many people may not enjoy this game as much as Super Mario 64, it is a lot more challenging than meets the eye, and could've had a few more worlds to arrange around it. Arguably, Super Mario Sunshine has a whole lot more to offer, but a little bit easier move would be to offer more worlds around. If you have the Gamecube, this has to be one of the few must-haves for the system. Try it, and be a plumber-mania buff like Mario.",4,"Mario Mania, Twisted",2004/1/17 0:00

Yes u can go back and replay the missions but it is not as fun. The purpose of this game is to clear all of the goo off the island and then beat the boss of each level and the more levels u beat the brighter the sky gets. as soon as u beat it the sky is the brightest it gets. This game is very fun but the replay value is not very good. It is not multiplayer either. The controls r good but the water is sometimes hard to use. I like super mario 64 better because it has more places to go to and more things to do after u beat it but these two games r very similar becides the water squirter. The graphics r very good for an old gc game. There is no blockiness it is all curved.

After Super Mario 64 blew everybody away in 1996, the only direction Nintendo could go for Mario is up. Super Mario Sunshine is proof - Literally, since it was the follow-up to 64. Is it as amazing? Probably not, but I would be lying if I didn't say this is one of the best Gamecube platformers (if not one of the best Mario games) ever!Super Mario Sunshine basically did what Mario 64 did and boosted everything up in scale. The levels are extremely well-crafted and fun to play around in, the graphics are incredibly colorful and fresh, and the soundtrack is a whole new selection of memorable Mario music! Even better, we now have new toys to play with in the gameplay department - Not only is Yoshi back (albeit with a downgrade), but you also get a FRICKIN' WATER PACK! This thing's name is F.L.U.D.D., and it drastically changes the way you play Sunshine for the better.You'll be squirting water to wash away graffiti M's, stunning enemies or attacking them, against bosses, wash out goo, etc. It doesn't sound too fun at first, but the result is truly satisfying, especially when you get to run around and shoot, as well as go into second-person view to shoot more precisely on certain occasions. The control is remarkably fluid, as Mario feels as acrobatic as ever. He can even use F.L.U.D.D. to hover in the air with water, leading to fun platforming moments by itself.When I say the levels are fun and well-crafted, I mean they are FUN AND WELL-CRAFTED. Every bit of these worlds contains memorable set pieces, so you can't get lost, and there's always something unique in various portions! Plus, the places themselves are brand-new to the Mario universe - You'll be fighting ghosts in a hotel, collecting Red Coins at an amusement park, and even ride squids at a harbor!Pretty much the only thing I have my concerns with is Bowser. I'm not going to spoil anything, but I'm gonna let you off with a warning - Fighting Bowser is not nearly as grand as in any other fight in a previous Mario game. It's rather disappointing, considering how everything else in the game is so great, but it doesn't diminish the fact that this game is an overall everlasting Gamecube treat!

AQMWZIH22R6LE,B000066JRN,"TwistaG Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore""""",5,4,"Link's new cel-shaded PaRappa-paper appearance; Metroid reinvented as an FPS; Mario's latest stint as an Earth-cleansing Greenpeace spokesman; the mere fact that Pikmin even exists-many gamers have taken these as sure signs that Shigeru Miyamoto's sanity meter has finally hit rock bottom. Here's hoping the entire video game industry contracts a crippling case of mad cow disease. In Super Mario Sunshine, paradise turns into a public relations nightmare when a beloved Italian is falsely accused of dirtying up an island resort with ugly magic gloop, chasing away the island's magical Shine Sprites and making things dark and dirty for vacationers everywhere. Now, in order to make reparations, he has to clean up the island using his patented F.L.U.D.D. water cannon and enter a variety of surreal island sub-worlds to explore, jump, dive, race, hover, and squirt his way to the missing Shines. If Mario Sunshine seems a lot like Mario 64 with a water cannon, that's not too far from the truth. Yes, the Shines are the equivalent of Mario 64's Stars. And yes, Delfino Plaza, much like Mario 64's castle, acts as a hub"" that connects the sub-worlds together. The levels are even structured in the same episodic fashion-one level contains eight ""episodes"" or missions-though the objectives are often less vague (thanks to a quick pre-mission ""fly-through""), the changes to the level in between each visit are much more visible, and it's much harder to ""accidentally"" stumble upon a Shine you weren't supposed to just yet. Levels are crafted with endless care, and each stage is its own preposterous superplayground-and a single level is packed with more gameplay variety than the entire length of your standard Mario-free 3D platform adventure. The ""challenge types"" are easily categorized, and you'll quickly recognize a pattern for the episodes in each sub-world: Fight a boss; collect eight red coins; explore a complex maze; win a race; fight the boss again in weirder circumstances; find a hidden cave that leads to a trippy obstacle course; chase down Shadow Mario; etc. But even though you may be collecting eight red coins for the eighth red time, you're never doing it quite the same way-and unthinkably clever level layouts mean things rarely get tedious or annoying.Rest assured, Mario's new ability to squirt water isn't merely a gimmick so Nintendo can say, ""Look, it's different""-here, it's as natural and integral a part of Mario's move list as his wall jump, butt stomp, or just good ol' fashioned ability to walk forward. There's hardly a moment when you aren't hovering or squirting or executing some sort of hover/squirt combo maneuver, be it to hose down an enemy, land a tricky jump, water a plant in the hopes of revealing some sort of pleasant surprise, or just giddily annoy the endlessly agreeable citizens of Delfino. The GameCube controller seems specifically designed for the task-double jumps, triple jumps, wall jumps, and backflips are executed with supernatural ease; narrow pathways are navigated effortlessly; and the analog shoulder button makes water cannon control a brainless affair. This is one of the tightest-controlling games you'll ever play. Mario Sunshine's graphics are best described as larger-than-life and absolutely alive. The smooth animation constantly delights, and a curious peek in the distance reveals an entire world of bulbous happy things hopping and bopping and glooping about. The sheer sense of scale is astonishing-sometimes you can see entire levels looming way out in the distance-and often leaves you with the overwhelmed, overjoyed feeling that there may, in fact, just be too many things to do in this damn game. The effects are glorious-the water (squirted or swum-through) is gorgeous, and the mirror effects are mind-bogglingly cool. The voice-acting in cut-scenes is weirdly understated and a bit rushed, but the garbled villager-speak is great, and the music is classic Mario. The one shortfall is the close-up graphical detail, where the primitive textures stand in sharp contrast to the rest of the game's polished glory. In summary: Yes, it's much bigger than Luigi's Mansion; yes, it's very, very much like Mario 64; no, you don't spend the whole game scrubbing dirt off walls as some sort of interactive environmental message; and yes-oh, hell yes-Mario Sunshine is exactly the brilliant, enormous, endlessly fun GameCube purchase-justifying Miyamoto supergame you were hoping it would be.

I mean, I've never had but two games ever draw me in like all get out to where I can't stop playing it(those games were Quake and Golden Sun). Now, I have a third. It's Kingdom Hearts. For those of you thinking it's a kiddie game, think again because this game will definitely hand that assumption back to you with a lil something extra. You play as Sora and along with Donald and Goofy....you go looking for Mickey meeting some mean ol' nasties along the way. Battles aren't of your usual Final Fantasy Variety as they are fought in real-time but they are awesome just the same as you can summon several Disney characters to help you out(mine favorite being Simba).If you're into RPGs, even if you're not, try out Kingdom Hearts.

And when you think Disney, you're gonna think kids stuff, first and foremost. So what was the reception when Square announced they paired with Disney to make a RPG? [...] But I seriously recommend you play it regardless of your feelings for Goofy and Donald.Story: The story starts off with Sora and a lot of his friends(including 3 from Final Fantasy) stranded on an island. One day, beings known as the Heartless descend and the group is seperated. In the Disney universe, King Mickey has disappeared and tells Donald and Goofy to search for the one with the key"" and Sora and the Disney characters get tangled up in a big plot. Great story that has a dark tone even with Disney and Square characters.Graphics: What great graphics and even capturing the worlds of Disney such as 100 Acre Woods(Winnie the Pooh)Halloween Town(Nightmare Before Christmas) and the jungle(Tarzan). And it's so nice to see you interact with Final Fantasy characters and Disney in the same screen.Sound: With Disney they always had memorable voices play their characters and hear they are authentic too(save for a couple). The music is great and fits each scene great. The only thing you might complain about is that most voices from the really old movies like Peter Pan and Sleeping Beauty don't have their original voices but it's no big deal.Gameplay: Hm...well playing the game is quite fun there's just one problem: the battle system. Basically you move the character with the Analog stick and the D-Pad for the menu. And it's all real-time too so if you're running out of health and need a potion fast, you can't just stop and take it or they'll get you. And that annoying camera.

Disney characters? You mean little Mickeys and Minnies in a game? Really, give it a chance. The game can be played by those under 10, but it's captivating for teenagers and adults too!First, the graphics are just AMAZING. The characters are all amazingly rendered. From Donald Duck to Goofy with their curves, to Tidus and Wakka from FFX and Selphie from FFVIII and more. There are different textures in each world, from the Jungle planet of Tarzan to the rooms and gardens of Alice in Wonderland, to the Coliseum of Olympus. They're all lovingly rendered in gameplay, and the cutscenes are gorgeous.Next, plot and gameplay. The 'heartless' have come to attack the various worlds, and you must investigate to figure out what is going on. There are many quests on each planet, all quite fun and logical. There are other cross-world quests, such as finding all 99 Dalmatian puppies or tracking down missing pages in a journal.Your main character, &quot;Sora&quot;, can be with Donald, Goofy, Tarzan, and other characters during these quests. In addition, he learns the ability to get help from other characters, such as Dumbo the Elephant. There is a lot of puzzle solving, but also a lot of combat as you fight off the shadow creatures.You get to choose your character type in the beginning - warrior, guardian or mystic. You also get to shape your personality by answering three questions about what you treasure in life, what you fear, and what you hope for. You level up as you go along, getting more strength and more skills.There are normal and hard settings, so you can set it to normal for the kids in the house and set it to hard for those looking for more of a challenge. There are a lot of witty references in the game that adults will be sure to love, and the younger ones will be happy seeing goofy and pluto protecting the land from the enemy.Final Fantasy players have always loved the romance that weaves through the FF series, and Kingdom Hearts provides that as well. Sora is in love with Kairi, and she is lost at the beginning of the game. So part of his quest is to find her and protect her.

With a great storyline, great music, top notch voice acting and a Unique way to battle and move around, the game easily scores a five.You control a young Boy named Sora (voiced by Haley Joel Osment) and he travels through the different realms of the Disney Kingdom trying to stop the heartless in an attempt to restore piece to the land and save the world.  While not as good as previous RPGs, this gives RPGers a little something different to enjoy.Battling is a little different.  To sum it all up, its very similar to Secret of Mana and Legend of Mana.  Thus meaning you can't control your two sub characters but you control the main one.  For each enemy you defeat you get MP orbs and HP orbs to restore health (like candy in Legend of Mana).  This is also interesting because when running around in towns you can choose to pick up something or other events.The characters present a more animated look.  I know that by some of the people they'll say its a kids game becasue of the disney characters (shame on you gamers for not even trying it first).  The voice acting for these characters is top notch with Haley Joel Osment doing the voice of Sora. Characters from the Final Fantasy series are here too. From Aeris and Cloud, to Squall and Yuffie, to the legendary Sephiroth.  The only problem is that Lance Bass is the voice of Sephiroth and while to some it doesn't seem like much, to those who've played FF7 they know that Lance Bass doesn't have the Sephiroth voice.The graphics are amazing and they look very realistic.  The music is great, and gameplay is too.  But if you've seen the disney moves a lot then you'll note that you might know the outcome of some events being that its like playing through the disney movie itself.This game also takes a new step in the RPG world.  When you select a new game you can choose to select Expert mode or Normal mode.  Not to mention that you can also answer the first series of question to decide how fast your characters level up!

I remember it very well from my childhood-the long, light-brown beaches, the pastel-colored garages and tenements, the Ferrari Testarossas coursing down the streets, that blond-haired guy with no socks blowing up cars with his shotgun, the serene Jan Hammer music...wait a minute, that was all on that one episode of Miami Vice I saw last night. Never mind. The Vice City we're talking about here may look a lot like the Miami that Crockett And Tubbs rocketed around every week in the 80s, but there's far more to it than meets the eye. After all, this city's home to the new Grand Theft Auto-a game that not only lets you play the villain escaping those impeccably fashionable cops, but is also the sequel to the highest-selling PlayStation 2 game of all time. Does it live up to the hype? It's fair to say so. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is set 15 years before all the mayhem that took place during GTAIII. You play Tommy Vercetti, a punk from Liberty City that just spent the last few years of his life in prison. He's sent down to Florida by his mob boss to scope out the local drug scene, but ends up caught in a coke deal gone bad. Now it's up to him to get both the drugs in question and the money lost in the process... not to mention the folks who tipped the cops off to the deal. What's the point of getting mad, after all, if you're not gonna get even later? Vice City works basically the same as its predecessor,you have free reign around the city (though half of it is inaccessible at the start of the game) and you're allowed to do whatever enters your mind. Assuming said whatever"" involves driving cars, stealing cars, attacking people, doing wheelies in the middle of rush-hour traffic, or sending an ice cream truck up a ramp and 200 feet in the air before landing in the ocean, that is. There are over 80 missions this time around, and they're tied together much more nicely. The endless fetch-n-kill jobs you had in GTAIII are mostly gone, replaced with everything from drive-bys and remote-control helicopter bombings to golf-cart car chases and pizza-boy assassinations. There's easily a hundred hours or so of gameplay here if you try tracking down all the hidden packages and stunt launchpads, but you'll likely add a few dozen more to that figure just by cruising around, checking out the city sprawl (it's twice as big as Liberty City), exploring the insides of buildings, and scaring up the cash to buy strip clubs and condos. Now, before I let myself espouse mightily about how addictive Vice City is, it may be best to go over some of its rough spots. Exhibit A: the graphics. The city looks beautiful, especially at night when it's all lit up with pastel colors, and there are all sorts of amusing touches you only get to see with thorough exploration. However, the famous GTAIII motion blur is back, and it's worse than ever: the entire game looks like Tommy took some kind of really bad acid. This feature can be turned off, and it's recommended you do so as soon as possible, but the blurring also hides some of the graphic plainness that's an unfortunate necessity of the game's huge environments. The GTA3 pop-in has returned, too-palm trees appear in front of you from just a few hundred feet away-and the characters in cutscenes still look kind of like marionettes with their weird flipper arms. All of this probably won't bother you too much-the game's just too darn fun for me to care-but it's still understandable why Rockstar didn't call this GTA4. A breathtaking sunset marks the end of another glorious day in Vice City. Tommy is so mesmerized that he moves into oncoming traffic to get a better view. Perhaps he needs some glasses. With that out of the way, it's time to espouse. Vice City is absolutely packed with new stuff to play with, and almost none of it is boring or badly implemented. Besides the usual new cars, Rockstar has added motorcycles and a helicopter or two to the city traffic-the former are tremendous fun to drive, and the latter is great for surveying the crime empire Tommy builds up towards the end of the game. Ray Liotta (from GoodFellas) provides the voice for Tommy, and he's spot-on wonderful in the role-the way he delivers each of his lines, from ""I'm gonna get your money back, okay?"" to ""Hey, I like this shirt,"" fits in perfectly with his smart-ass street criminal role. But the best praise should really be reserved for the radio-station soundtrack. This is 1986 we're talking about, of course, so the in-game stations play nothing but your favorites from the age of yuppies and wine coolers. Michael Jackson, Hall and Oates, Mr. Mister, Jan Hammer himself-they, along with a few dozen others, are all in effect here. If you liked the hilarious radio chatter from GTA3, there's a ton more of that here, too. Make sure you're not in the middle of a multi-car police chase while listening to the Crocodile Hunter parody; you'll likely break into laughter and drive into a light post or moped rider. When you get right down to it, nothing much in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is different from its predecessor. The aiming system's been improved, and the character models look a bit (just a bit) spiffier, but that's about it. However, you'd be deeply mistaken if you think the formula's stale. The gameplay in Vice City is more addictive than ever, except now there's twice as much of what made the first game so great-more streets, more cars (and other vehicles), more cool missions, more awesome street life. GTA3 fans won't be disappointed one bit, and those few PS2 owners who never played the last title are in for one of the most time-consuming games they've ever played. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a dirt bike I wanna send flying over this channel...""",5,Best GTA yet...,2003/7/7 0:00

The amount of blood spilled per fight is simply amazing. I'm not sure that a body actually HAS that much blood in it!First off, it's a great fighting game that is available on all of the major platforms. You can play single player or against a friend, and you hack, slash and impale in a variety of arenas with a variety of characters.Like all other games in this style, you can choose from a limited number of characters first (in this one about 10) and then as you go you unlock the other 10 characters. You can unlock arenas and alternate outfits and other items as well, including artwork.The unlocking is all done through earning money. Each set of wins you achieve gives you cash. You can then go down and open koffins (there are HUNDREDS of them) and each one does something. It's really good to find a website to get the printout of koffins! Many are simply empty, but some give you great items or extra cash. You can easily rack up lots of money if you know which koffins to open.The graphics are great, and the fighting is good. The arenas have great detail and each character's moves are very fluid. Each character has 3 styles they can cycle through, and a number of moves in each one. I have heard some people complain that there are only a few finishing moves, but really, that's just the one final blow in the fight. We hardly noticed in our gameplay.A fun fighting game for those who enjoy the genre, but not for young kids!

Unlike the pseudo-3-D Mortal Kombat 4, Deadly Alliance is the real deal: filled with lush backgrounds, realistic looking fighters, and buckets of blood, Deadly Alliance is the technological breakthrough that fans of the series have waited years for.  Although it has a few faults (Liu Kang is dead, the storyline is weak compared to storylines in past installments of the game), Deadly Alliance still offers loads of value.  Plenty of new fighters are introduced (Kenshi, Bo' Rai Cho, Drahmin, Frost, Hsu Hao, Li Mei, Mavado, Nitara, and Moloch), as well as bringing back old favorites (Cyrax, Jax, Johnny Cage, Kano, Kitana, Kung Lao, Quan Chi, Raiden, Reptile, Scorpion, Shang Tsung, Sonya, and Sub-Zero).  The older fighters have been given complete makeovers, and they all look phenominal (Sub-Zero's new look is a real highlight).  Each fighter has 2 different fighting styles, and one other style which includes a weapon; this feature is a welcome addition to the franchise and is pulled off almost flawlessly.  Also included besides the standard Arcade mode is the Konquest mode in which you go on various missions and earn Koins which you can use to purchase all kinds of hidden items (characters, costumes, arenas, production designs, etc.) in the Krypt.  Also included is an interesting video timeline on the history of Mortal Kombat, footage of the making of the game, and a video for Adema's &quot;Immortal&quot;.

MK4 got mixed reviews from fans and critics and wasn't exactly what they wanted. Being only the second 3D Mortal Kombat game it was another reboot that took itself more seriously and became more complicated and deep. It featured three different fighting styles, long combo chains that you had to memorize, and gone were the days of fast button mashing. You now had to think ahead for your next move and strategize. It was the most robust and sophisticated fighting game ever made at the time, but it didn't come without its flaws.Deadly Alliance was the first MK game to venture out away from just fighting in a core title. The team added a Konquest mode which is a giant tutorial on how to use every fighter and learn all their moves. This is pretty big for a fighter and can be a lot of fun. You follow Raiden down a long path across various MK worlds and learn about each fighter. They each have three different fighting stances; two regular and one weapon stance. That's not all though, these can combo into and out of each other for major damage. Characters with blade type weapons can impale their weapons into the opponent to make them bleed out, but they lose the weapon for that round. This more technical fighting style for MK had mixed reactions, but I like it a lot.One thing I wasn't fond of were the lack of special moves and fatalities. There's only one fatality per character and a lot of them are mediocre at best. They aren't as gory or as awesome as previous games. Cyrax is missing his net move, a few characters only have 2-3 special moves, so it feels a weak. At least the mini-games make a return because they haven't been seen since MK1. A new Test-Your-Sight mini-game is added which is a cup and ball game. The team also added a Kurrency system and a Krypt to unlock costumes, videos, art, and interviews. I love this a lot and is a great fan service. However, once you unlock the entire Krypt there's not much else to come back to. Unless you are playing with a friend on the couch the game is just seriously lacking in single player content and is why I got bored with it after a couple of months.The graphics were decent for the time, but the gore looks like balls of Jell-O and the characters look like plastic dolls. The women's breast physics look like swaying punching bags at 100 MPH even when you tap forward slightly. The sound effects are a bit weak and a few are recycled from MK4. The arenas are also kind of boring and many of them are new. The overall game is pretty solid but needed more polish. I also wasn't too fond of the new characters. A few were likable such as Frost, Nitara, and Drahmin, but all the rest just felt forced or rushed. I also didn't really like a lot of the redesigned characters such as Sonya and Johnny Cage. The character design is just really lacking here, but that could be just me being a picky fan.Overall, Deadly Alliance is a nice change for the series and the more complex and strategic fight style may not be for everyone. The lack of content really hurts his game though, and it suffers from an overall lack of polish.

A2582KMXLK2P06,B00006FWTW,B. E Jackson,0,0,"Count me as another person who grew up with the Super NES version back in the mid 90's.  I still consider Yoshi's Island one of the best games EVER made.  Not just by Nintendo either- I mean the greatest game ever made.  It's seriously in the top 3.  It was magical the first time I played Yoshi's Island, and it's never lost its magic since.  Truly a classic game in every sense (except maybe in the music department- that one doo wop or old fashioned stageshow theme that plays in the outside platform-dominated areas is quite annoying in my opinion).Why is Yoshi's Island so incredible you ask?  Because the gameplay involves shooting eggs using a target that moves up and down in order to get through the abundance of tough obstacles and tricky enemies.  Shooting eggs is both simple and rewarding.  It takes time to master some tricky ricochet shots that are required later on.  It's ridiculously fun.More importantly however, the challenge involved when attempting to collect 20 red coins, 5 white flowers and 30 stars per level is a LOT of fun.  I will never understand people who play this game simply to complete the levels and disregard collecting the coins, flowers and stars.  It goes against what the game encourages you to do, so if you play the game with the purpose of collecting those items and 100%-ing the stages, it makes Yoshi's Island significantly more fun than most platform games.  Collecting items actually serves an important purpose here.  You WANT to collect everything so you can get a perfect score on each and every level.Anyway, nobody has taken the time to detail what each of the six exclusive bonus levels are like, so I'll take the time right now to do that.Exercise In the Skies- The first half of this level is pretty much like Hit That Switch with the fast moving platforms and jumps but less strenuous (significantly less strenuous in fact) but the other two portions of the level prove to be quite the challenge.  The second part of the stage is quite tedious.  You have to use one of those blue round platforms and collect coins and flowers while it's spinning not just forward, but sometimes backwards and down.  This definitely adds more frustration to the overall trickiness of the level.  The third half of the stage is comparable to the first level in World 2 with the giant falling gray blocks that serve as temporary platforms for you to jump across.  Perhaps a better comparison is the final portion of a stage in World 5 (5-7) with the same kind of falling gray blocks.  This is MUCH harder though.  Fluttering constantly and treading carefully is your only way of suvival.  It's a decent level, but nothing earth-shattering or anything.  Plus it's way too short.  I think the challenge could have been toned down a tad.Mystery of the Castle- If this were a regular castle stage, I'd consider it above average.  It has that incomplete feeling to it, but that could be because everything you explore here has already been done in the Super NES version.  The first half is loaded with bats, jumping over spikes, baseball boys/spiked platform swapping (both green and red ones).  The second half of the castle produces mixed feelings since it's dominated with those wooden-type platforms with arrow signs on them.  I believe they appeared in at least one cave section in the normal stages (including Super NES version) but they're used more creatively here. This basically means throughout the second half of the castle you'll be spending most of your time shooting eggs at the arrows on these particular platforms in order to change the direction they travel, and avoiding floor/ceiling spikes as you ride on top of them.  Not a bad level and by the way this stage has a slight maze quality in a few sections, but not a bonus-quality level either.  Certainly not enough to consider buying for those that already own the Super NES version.  Also ugh- they put a tricky red coin, the LAST red coin of the stage in fact, right at the very end by way of a shy guy holding it for a few seconds before flying away.  Absolutely the dirtiness trick Nintendo could have pulled there!  It's definitely tricky getting obtaining the red coin.Items Are Fun-  Actually this level is not particularly fun.  It basically consists of two parts- an underground pipe maze section, and having to utilize doors a certain way to alter the appearance of the snow/ice environment above.  You'll constantly be returning to the same room in the beginning of the level hitting P switches, going through pipes, and figuring out a pretty boring maze.  The object (besides figuring out the maze) is a variety of issues.  Freezing enemies to advance to higher areas, and using flame watermelons in another area to melt the ice and reach higher, newer areas.  Dusty, breakable gray floors are occupied everywhere, and basically Items Are Fun is entirely puzzle-based without encountering many enemies or tricky obstacles.  Still, I like the stage but many people overrate it.  The snowball you push around in order to make bigger was done more creatively in the regular game along with the ski lift portion which feels underwhelming here.  I don't get the name of the level either- exactly WHAT items are supposed to be fun?  Flame and ice watermelons?  A level that obviously feels incomplete in both the excitement category and the way the maze is laid out.  It's not enough.Go! Go! Morphing- Look, I admit I love this game to pieces, but every game has a couple mistakes along the way.  This level is *awful* the entire way through.  Absolutely dreadful.  First of all the mole and the train transformations are without a doubt the worst ones in the game, but for some reason Nintendo included them in the most generic way (the train) or the most tedious way (*cough couch* mole *cough cough*) imaginable.  This is one very disappointing level.  I was expecting this to be the most exciting level in the game with each of the morph vehicles leading way to an even more exciting one.  That's not the case at all.  It simply recyles what we've already accomplished in other stages.  First of all, the level misses the mark because there's hardly any enemies whatsoever so it lacks excitement and replay value, but an even bigger problem is that none of the morphs are actually interesting.  It starts off with the submarine and a small maze, but you don't need the torpedoes for anything.  My least favorite morph while playing the regular levels has always been the train, and that one is unfortunately next.  It's boring.  Up and down the tracks speeding along collecting coins.  Terrible.  The mole is another morph I'm not particularly fond of (because it's somewhat hard to control- resulting in some unintentionally deaths off the side of the cliff in a couple instances) and it takes up WAY too much of the level.  My two favorite morphs are the helicopter and the car, but they aren't used in any creative way either.  The car is especially disappointing.  Instead of speeding along, you have to jump on rotating platforms.  Bad idea.  Easily my least favorite level of the 6 bonus levels.Fight Toadies With Toadies is by FAR my favorite of the bonus levels.  It features green bullet bills that you must bounce on top of in order to reach higher areas, shy guys on stilts and creatively using them to bypass rows of spikes, dizzy fuzzies and careful planning pertaining to platform jumps, and at the very end comes the most delightfully challenging part, a fast-moving auto scrolling section that forces you to move forward avoiding even more green bullet bills.  VERY hard final portion of the level.  I love this stage quite a bit.  It's exciting and challenging as well as charmingly atmospheric (especially in the cave section)- just how I like it.Endless World of Yoshis- Probably the second best of the exclusive levels featured in this version because of its lengthy exploration aspect for one thing, and the diversity is staggering.  Castles, fireballs, bullet bills, shy guys of many varities, lava pits, flower seeds creating vines, underground caves, boulder pushing, running around as tiny starman Mario, baseball boys with egg and watermelon seed puzzles, etc.  A LOT of creativity.  I really enjoy this one.  However it's very very disappointing that I'm only playing as ONE Yoshi the entire time.  I was under the assumption that I'd be playing as numerous different colored Yoshi's the entire level, but I'm only playing as the standard green one.  I don't get how the level got its name.  It's definitely an endless world of excitement and that's the important thing!  Also, this level features red biting bullet bills that sort of veer in Mario's direction when he gets close, and I don't remember seeing them in the regular game so that's worth seeing.Anyway, these bonus levels aren't really worth investigating an additional copy for even though Fight Toadies with Toadies and Endless World of Yoshi's are both incredibly awesome stages, unless you wanna play the game on the road.  I'd rather stick with the Super NES version myself.  That version doesn't have any filler levels like this one.Oh, and one more complaint with this game- why in the WORLD does Yoshi sound like a howling bloodhound whenever you hover in the air?  At least Mario's crying outburst sounds muffled and tame in comparison to the Super NES edition. That's probably the biggest bonus of all!  Actually he sounds crankier like he has a dirty diaper, but to a less annoying extent.",4,"slightly flawed, but still a great game",2010/10/15 0:00

Now first, this is actually quite fun, albeit in some places a little frustrating.Story: Basically this follows the beginning of Fellowship(the battle with Isildur at the base of Mount Doom) to the end of the first half of Two Towers(Helm's Deep). Even though they may have skipped some parts story wise it follows the books greatly.Graphics: Wow. These are some great graphics. Dynasty Warriors 2 had some pretty blah backgrounds but LOADS of enemies and allies. This has maybe 10 at once to 20 but the locations look great. Plus the transition from actual movie footage to CG is near flawless.Music: They included many of the voices of the movie so that's always a plus. Battle cries, swords and other good stuff is featured. The music is great and keeps the scene moving(you don't wanna fight 10 monsters at once with boring romantic music do you?)Gameplay: Now, button mashers beware. You might like this. You really got to pay attention to your combos. Simple pressing random buttons won't get you far. Another problem I had is I was using Legolas and I got up to the second part of Helm's Deep fighting an endless array of enemies and fighting out I'm a little weak. In most RPG's you can go back to level up and get better enhancements to help. This is just &quot;if you're at Level 5 and you barely have enough skills to continue then sorry, keep going.&quot;But other than that, it's quite a fun game and urge you to try it out regardless if you're into Lord of the Rings or not.",4,Quite a fun game,2002/12/10 0:00

The other Lord of the Rings game is based on the book, and just on the FIRST book. It's VERY short and a puzzle-adventure. In comparison, The Two Towers is based on the first TWO MOVIES, NOT the books. And it is a straight button-bashing fighting game. The up side of both of these games is that they're great Aragorn-fun. The down side of both of these games is that both are WAY TOO SHORT.At least in this one you really CAN play all three characters. After the first two levels (a prologue and Weathertop) you can now choose, on each level, to be Aragorn, Gimli or Legolas. Each character has his own fighting style, from Gimli's little battle-tankness to Legolas' great double-sword action, to Aragorn's lean ranger fighting. Yes, I love Aragorn's fighting style :)This game, being based on the movie, has TONS of detail from the movie. They worked with the actual actors for the voices, and got their hands on the actual movie models for the game sets. You can see the attention to detail. There are all sorts of 'special features' where you can watch interviews with the actors and see photos from the second movie. So it's sort of like an interactive preview of Movie 2!It is SHORT thought. You can run the game through on a character in about 5 hours. Then you just run through again as the other 2. There's a secret character and level, but that's about it. There are no puzzles, no quests, it's all just bash-through-the-enemies-and-then-bash-at-the-boss. Either the boss is easy - if you find his weakness - or he is REALLY NASTY and VERY VERY FRUSTRATING. A bit of tuning needed to be done in here. And again, where the other game had at least a bit of thinking involved, this one is solely mash-mash-mash those buttons.Still, it's really great to be in the movie"" and hear the familiar soundtrack and voices around you. A must have for any Lord of the Rings fan - and if it's short, just spend the rest of the time trying to get a PERFECT score on every level, and watching all the videos that come with the game!""",4,"Great graphics and sound, but a button-masher",2002/10/26 0:00

You get to play as Aragorn, Legolas, or Gimli as you fight your way through 11 levels of pure hack & slash action.  The first half of the game is based on events in the first installment of the series, with the second half featuring events in the second installment.  Graphic wise the game is top notch, these are some of the best graphics to be seen on the PS2 yet.  Character models look like they're film counterparts and the animation is silky smooth.  Slowdown is minimal at best, even when there are hordes of enemies on screen at once.  Control is tighter than I could have ever expected, the easy targeting system and easy to execute chain attacks are very well done and simple to execute.  The action moves at a very fast pace, so fast that you might be able to finish the game in one or two sittings; this alone is the game's biggest flaw but there are a few extras.  Judging by your level by level performance, you can unlock extra features like a survival mode and even see video interviews with members of the film's cast.

It's a very open-ended game so you will find yourself going through a spot on a level, destroying, searching, finding, and back tracking quite a bit. Here is my review for Metriod Prime for the Nintendo Gamecube.Graphics: 10/10. Definitely the best standout for the game. Unbelievable graphics show how powerful the little Nintendo Gamecube really is. It's quite easy to compare these graphics to a Graphical King like Halo. Hell, when you walk over some things in this game your mask will get foggy. That is pretty cool. The enviroments look great and so do the critters. Samus' suit is very shiny too. :]Sound: 9/10. Very well done sound. The music is great, the different baddies you shoot at make unique sounds, the bosses do as well, the water sounds good, everything sounds good. It really adds to the experience with the game.Control: 9/10. The control for many may be extremely frustrating and confusing, but really it's not all that bad. There are quite a few different controls but it's nothing to get bent out of shape about and get so depressed you want to hang yourself in the bathroom, no, but they are somewhat hard to get used to, I guess. But after you play for about a half an hour you will get the feeling.Fun: 7/10. This is where the game just sinks for me. The game is great in everything else except the fun. It's fun until you get to a hard part and you have absolutely no idea what to do so you need to backtrack and whatnot just to pass a little part of a level. Another flaw is no multiplayer; which definitely should have been added in this game because it could have been a great party game; even if there would be no online play. So basically, this is a single player game that is about 50% exploration, 20% boredom, and 30% action. This game I found to be very hard, so if you want to succeed in Metroid Prime, you had better get a strategy guide. Good luck.7.9/10",4,"Just Okay"".""",2006/3/19 0:00
A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B00006IJJK,blackaciddevil,1,1,"To be completely honest, this is my first time being immersed into the world of Metroid. Even though I played Metroid Prime Hunters ages ago on the Nintendo DS, I can't say I remember too much about it(other than the fact that it was a short game single playerwise and dealt more with multiplayer). This time, however, I've gotten deeply into things and I'm hooked. Now I see why Metroid is revered the world over and I'm curious to find out more.Metroid Prime takes place three years after the events of Metroid. Samus receives a distress call in her new ship and travels to Tallon IV. Basically to stop the Space Pirates from exploiting a powerful radioactive substance known as Phazon. It's here she discovers that the Chozo once settled there but disappered due to a meteor hitting the planet decades before. That's where it all begins. I don't want to say too much because I don't want to give too much of it away.Overall, this game is more about exploring than killing enemies and that's why I like it so much.",5,Metroid Prime........,2010/10/29 0:00
A2582KMXLK2P06,B00006IJJK,B. E Jackson,3,3,"Metroid Prime is definitely overrated.  Let me list all the reasons why-- The game totally rips off Mega Man Legends 2, a Playstation game released two years before this game came out on the Gamecube.  The fire snakes that pop out of the lava, and the beetles that pop out of the ground, are two things in particular that are WAY too similar to aspects of MML2 for me to buy this is supposed to be some kind of coincidence.- The music is severely disappointing.  The main theme song where the spaceship is located in the beginning of the game is a remake of the classic theme from the original Metroid (released in 1986) but done much, much worse.  Oh sure, it may have sounded beautiful and epic back in 2002 to signal the realistic approach to the 3D movement video games were taking at the time, but nowadays, this particular theme lacks inspiration, melody, and any distinctive qualities.  In other words, despite the epic beauty of the music, it's just bland and pointless to me.  I'll take the original 1986 version with its inspirational melody thank you very much.- I mention this game feels like a ripoff of Mega Man Legends 2.  It's also a ripoff of Quake II, the classic PC shooter.  The environments and many of the dark areas feel *exactly* like Quake II, which makes me wonder why I'm playing Metroid Prime when I COULD be playing Quake II instead.  Metroid Prime is nothing more than a corridor shooter.- The enemies you encounter are quite uninspiring for the most part.  You have these suicidal bats that dart down from the ceiling, but they're small, boring and lack inventiveness.  You have vines that pop out of walls and pretend like they're snakes- these are just annoying to shoot.  You have wasps that swarm from hives and dive at you- it is VERY irritating to take out a swarm of these.  There was nothing like this in Super Metroid.  Nothing was irritating about the enemies in that game.  Enemies are not only annoying to take out completely, but unacceptable to look at because of the way bland way they were designed.- Boss battles are flat-out horrible.  That gigantic plant you have to take out is underwhelming compared to the plant boss in Super Metroid (not to mention it takes WAY too much time to actually defeat, despite your best efforts to use the charge beam and morph ball).  I'm not impressed at all here- boss battles are, for the most part, overlong and boring with no usage of creativity on the part of the developers.- Metroid Prime overall suffers from the same problem that Resident Evil 4 suffers from- the movie-like cinematic feel of the entire game, used for no other reason than a cheap attempt to make the game look as much like a movie as possible.  I don't see the appeal of these kind of games to be totally honest- going for that grand and pretentious movie theater effect in video games has been done so many times by this point that it's just not worth the time or energy to create them this way anymore, not to mention graphics aren't nearly as important as many gamers would have you believe- graphics mean crap to me.- The game is trying to go for a perfect 3D update to Super Metroid, but Metroid Prime is *nothing* like Super Metroid.  How CAN it be???  Metroid Prime is just one of literally hundreds of generic 3D shooters out there where one man (or in this case, woman) goes through a huge world, narrow corridors, and shooting and exploring... and before you say this game is all about exploration... let me respond by saying Not really"".  The exploration aspect has been greatly exaggerated because you're honestly not exploring more in this game than you are in, say, Quake II and THAT game never gets credit for the exploratory features it implements, so neither should this one.I just don't like this game very much.  It's boring, overrated, and not very fun.  This game gets a 2 out of 5, despite the fact amazon keeps saying I'm giving it a 5 out of 5.  Trust me, I'm not.""",5,"average, maybe even below average",2006/10/21 0:00
A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B00006IJJK,"Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...""",1,1,"This review was written when the game was first released.Metroid Prime"" is a game whose release has finally connected the Metroid series to the new age of gaming. The star of the series is Samus Aran, a bounty hunter who, actually, is never seen doing that much bounty hunting. She is more of just an ""alien hunter"" rather than a bounty hunter, but ""bounty hunter"" sounds cooler.So, anyways, Samus the ""bounty hunter"" is orphaned from an attack by Space Pirates, who aren't really pirates, just a race of ""interstellar nomads"", as the manual says. So after the space pirates zap Samus' planet, they go and build a huge research complex on the planet Zebes, wiping out most of the native population. They are researching these creatures called ""Metroids"", which had been recently discovered by the Galactic Federation.The Space Pirates stayed there for a couple years, researching Metroids, finding new and exciting ways to blow people up, when who should arrive but Samus Aran. She had somehow avoided being blown up along with the rest of her planet's population and had been raised by the Chozo, a bird-like race of creatures. It turns out Zebes had, before the Space Pirates moved in, been a Chozo colony! Whoops! So, the Chozo, being annoyed that a world's worth of their people had been blasted into itty-bitty pieces, they infused Samus with some Chozo blood (giving her super strength, endurance, and speed), gave her a power suit with a gun-arm attached to it, and told her to go smite the Space Pirates until there weren't any space pirates left to smite.So Samus blasted her way through them, cutting a bloody swath through their operation and even getting the captain, Ridley, and their giant spike-shooting reptile friend, Kraid. Eventually she got to the inner sanctum of the operation, and blasted every Metroid she could find. Finally, she got to the Brain of the Metroids, the Mother Brain, and she blasted that too. So, thinking her job was done, she went to look for the Chozo, who had for some reason gone into hiding.But the Space Pirates weren't done yet. The survivors immediately split into two groups. Group One returned to Zebes to resuscitate Mother Brain, Kraid, and Ridley. Group Two went off looking for a new planet to make a base on. They found Tallon IV, a planet that had been a Chozo colony until a meteor brought some freaky mutating stuff called ""Phazon"" that drove most of the Chozo to leave. Before they left, figuring it was the most they could do, the Chozo sealed the meteor off with a temple and split its core, sealing the pieces away. By that time, it was too late for the planet. Plants and animals had been mutated into hideous forms, the ecosystem was completely trashed, and basically the planet was one big nuclear mess. The pirates come across it and decide it's the PERFECT place to live, what with the new experiments they can perform on the little nuclear beasties and such. They leave their ship in orbit so they can send things up and perform ""Zero-G experiments"" on them. Samus finds them, lands on their frigate, and that's where the game starts up. Undoubtedly, there are a few holes in this story, such as: where did she get her ship? It was not mentioned, but in the game, it says it is, ""Registered to Samus Aran."" So where did she get it registered? And why is she called a Bounty Hunter? These are just some of the many story-loopholes in this game.The reason I said that Metroid Prime connected Metroid to the new age is because, unlike the Kirby, Legend of Zelda, Mario, and Donkey Kong series, Metroid did NOT have its own game on the N64. Sure, there was Super Smash Brothers, but that was only a cameo role. There have been only four Metroid games so far: Metroid, for the NES, Metroid II: Return of Samus for the Game Boy, and Super Metroid for the SNES. The last one was made in 1994. Metroid fans have gone 8 YEARS without another Metroid game, and now they get it. And it was worth the wait. Metroid Prime is very well done. In their update to the New Era, many games, mostly side-scrollers like Mario or adventure games like The Legend of Zelda, took the ""Third-Person camera"" view, with the camera following behind the character. However, ruling that a 3rd Person shooting game (not adventure, it's SHOOTING!) would be kind of annoying, the Metroid Prime design team decided to make it a First-Person shooter. And by golly, it worked.One of the main differences between this game and other First-Person Shooters is that Metroid Prime has only four types of beam weapons, along with missiles. Most other FPSs have a huge arsenal of weapons, ranging from basic pistols to shotguns to Hi-Tech lasers to guided rocket launchers. Not this game. A basic blaster, an electric wave beam, an ice beam, and a plasma beam are all you get. And even though there are only five types of weapon, this game is anything but boring. Along with the four beam guns, you also get four visors: A basic ""Combat Visor"", a ""Scan Visor"", a heat-tracking ""Thermal Visor"", and an ""X-Ray Visor"". The Combat Visor is just the normal interface, seeing the world without special goggles. It does, like all the other visors, feature a Heads Up Display, showing health, missiles and a special Danger Level monitor, which goes up when you are near hazards like lava or poison gas.The Scan Visor, the only visor where you cannot shoot, serves another useful purpose: scanning objects and enemies. When you scan an enemy, the scan reveals the weak spots of the creature, its environment, and its habits. You can also scan hieroglyphs on the wall to read Chozo Lore, you can scan parts of the environment to study plants, you can scan Space Pirate computers to learn about their evil operation, and you can scan power-ups and various stations to learn about them. At some points, scanning nearby objects gives hints on how to get by an area. There are five categories of scan-able items in your database: Creatures, Artifacts, Space Pirate information, Chozo Lore, and Research (powerups). If a scanned object fits into one of these categories, it is put into your database for later research. If you fill up a certain amount of a category, then you are rewarded with Image Galleries, which contains concept art, storyboards, and so on. The Scan Visor gives depth to an otherwise lonely game.The X-Ray and Thermal Visors both are good for their own reasons, such as seeing invisible objects and enemies, but if you are trying to look at something right in front of you, then certain qualities may make it kind of hard to see. Also, in certain areas, wearing the thermal visor isn't such a good idea (such as in Magmoor Caverns, an underground lava-lake).The graphics in this game are great. From the icy, frozen Sheegoth to the Flaming Magmoor, the creatures of this game are all very well done. Also, the First-Person effects are very well done, too. Go near an electric enemy and your screen becomes static-filled and hard to see through. If Samus is electrocuted or hit for a lot of damage, she puts her hand up to block the blast. Things like these remind you that the character of this game is a person, not just a thing with a gun.Also, the sound in this game is incredible. The music gives a good sense of place. For example, the music in the Chozo Ruins is mysterious and dark, while the music for the Lava-based Magmoor Caverns is thunderous and includes chanting and such. Certain little tunes, such as the one that plays when you find a major item, will be familiar to players of Super Smash Brothers and Melee (the item tune is what plays as Samus' victory song). The creatures in the game growl, roar, or shriek, depending on what it is. The beam guns all have different sounds. If the electric wave gun kills an enemy, electricity crackles all over the enemy's body, making ""zzap-zzap"" noises for a couple seconds. The attention to detail is immense.Samus has always been the first real heroine, but the kind where hero or heroine doesn't matter. You didn't know in the first couple games that Samus was a girl. At the end of one of the later games, Samus takes off her helmet and reveals her gender, as opposed to being a robot. Heck, in most games you wouldn't even know she was human! But in this game, you can tell she is a she. You can hear her voice when she is hit, and (this is a feature that adds a lot of realism), when she dies, she screams and the display flickers and goes out. Also, in parts like elevators, the camera shows Samus from the front, and then zooms in on her face. Yes, her face! Instead of just an opaque green faceplate, the faceplate is now transparent, so you can see her eyes, eyebrows and the outline of her head (kind of). This is a HUGE step forward in realism terms. And about her heroine-ness: She is an armored, tough girl with a gun. Her competitors (for example, Lara Croft) go around dangerous ruins in incredibly skimpy clothing. Heroine advantage: Samus, obviously. Good sense counts for a lot these days.Overall, this game earns an eight out of ten. Metroid Prime is good, but not perfect. The scariness of some scenes makes it not a good choice for some small children. However, if you are used to that kind of thing, this is a great game.""",4,Release Date Review,2012/7/7 0:00

What is it you ask? Well its just a beautiful/spine chilling first person shooter that takes you from the depths of Magmoor Caverons to the frozen Phendrana Drifts. This is like when metroid woke up from the dead because no Metroid game was made on a home system since Super metorid which was also amazing. Then followed by Metroid 2: Return of Samus on GB. And boy has it came back to life for a good reason. The graphics are crystal clear for a GameCube game in 2001. Better than most ps2 shooter games that you would see at the time and future. Anyway, you are samus and you land on tallon IV after an explosion. There you travel around fighting mini bosses, bosses and regular enimies for those of you who havent played Metroid. This game like all other Metroid games do require allot of mental puzzle minded thinking or else you will get stuck or not know what to do next. It was quite hard for me to beat when i was young. Walkthoughs help allot. The story is very amazing that will keep you hooked on playing for months untill beat and then you will want to beat it again. The atmospheres change from underground volcanic, frozen snowdrifts, rainy nature, to ancient ruins. Each containing several attachments and upgrades for your suit. The further you go, the better stuff you need. Like all other metroid games this one has very soothing and upbeat music that strangly comforts you. The story should take you a good 10-20 hours depending on how you game and every millisecond is worth it. Sadly there is no other mode to do however you can hook up a completed metroid fusion gameboy game to the GameCube and play the original Metroid on the NES and you can even save on it.

The game consists of five huge levels that you go back and forth from finding upgrades to your suit. There are a total of 4 weapons, 4 weapons upgrades, plus a few Morph Ball upgrades etc.My favorite part of the game are the cool Morph Ball sections yet there aren't enough of them. You can, eventually, use the Spider Track Ball upgrade to click to ceilings and walls and there are some really cool segments for this yet only a few. You explore each level by needing to use a certain upgrade to get through such as a door needing a certain weapon to open it. You can also get missile expansion upgrades, power bomb upgrades, and energy tank (life) upgrades, but most of these are extremely hard to find and only die-hard Metroid fans will spend the time finding them. On the other hand there are tons of different enemy types and cool bosses. The game is just about exploring and now that it's in 3D Nintendo really makes you explore. The controls are ""dumbified"" for Nintendorks who were used to the 2D era and didn't know how to control an FPS so there is a lock on system (that is a bit annoying) and you use the L trigger to move your reticle. This can be really annoying for people used to standard FPS controls. You have to always stop to find out where to jump while enemies are attacking you. First hint: Nintendo this doesn't work! Secondly, there are a lot of different types of environments from water, to ice, to viney green lands.Once you find your Gravita suit you can run through water with no problem so in turn you can explore more areas. After you get all of your add ons you have to find twelve artifacts to get to Metroid Prime. Basically, if you've played other Metroid games this is exactly like those except in 3D. I hated the constant backtracking and lousy save system. You will be in one level but the next add-on is two levels away. Instead of warping there you have to run through every single level and the enemy respawning doesn't help either. The best thing I liked about this game was the visuals. They look amazing for a launch title, and what's amazing are all the effects. Water and steam will hinder your vision, there will be static on-screen when your electronics are disrupted, Samus' face will reflect off her visor.The sound, on the other hand, isn't so great with Ecco the Dolphin esque music and creepy techno. While some of it works it just sounds really old. There is also no multiplayer at all so this is another disappointment. You can link your Metroid Fusion GBA game for extra stuff, but I couldn't try that out. The game also sports the lamest endings ever (and I got the second best one). Overall, if you hated Metroid before you still will, and if you loved it before you'll love it more. Newcomers stay away if you don't like your FPS formula messed with.

AQMWZIH22R6LE,B00006IJJK,"TwistaG Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore""""",0,0,"Metroid Prime has, since the announcement that it would be first-person and in 3D, enjoyed the kind of controversial hype that only a first-party Nintendo game can enjoy. Once Nintendo announced that Retro Studios was going 3D with the title, it quickly joined the new Zelda in the What are they thinking?"" club. You (yes, you) most likely thought it would be ruined once it began to look more and more like a first-person shooter. You then read E3 impressions that said the game was good, but you probably didn't listen. Well, guess what, Mr. Smarty: Metroid Prime is good. Really good. While Prime's graphics lack a little polish and flair and the controls never really become second-nature, the game itself simply rules. If you're an old-school Metroid fanatic, you can skip the next paragraph or two as we explain the idea to the new folks. Metroid games have always been about exploration, secret areas, and collecting power-ups that are cleverly hidden in plain sight. You might see a door in the first room that you can't reach until much later in the game, and behind that door might lie an entire new set of rooms to discover. You'll do a lot of backtracking, but you'll do it with a purpose as you realize that the cliff that was too high to get to in the beginning is a piece of cake with your new Space Jump boots. Within a few structural limits, you have free reign of the place to come, see, and conquer as you will. As you play, the world unfolds before you, and you become the powerful warrior you need to be to end the threat that enfolds the world of Tallon IV. In the beginning, Metroid Prime suffers from its own expectations. Since it is a first-person game, you'll likely fumble around with the controls as you try to play the game like, say, TimeSplitters 2 or Halo. At some point, though, you'll realize that this is not Halo, and you'll adjust. When you do, you'll be surprised just how much like the old Metroids this game feels. You jump from platform to platform (always a pain in first-person games, but rather forgiving in Metroid), use your Ice Beam and Varia Suit, and fight the same enemies you remember from the older games in the series. Once you reach that point, you'll fall right back into the old Metroid groove, and it's all smooth sailing from there. There are a few minor problems with the game. First off, while the controls are great once you get used to them, the learning curve is pretty steep, and even once you know them pretty well, they never seem to feel natural. Ten hours into the game you'll still be accidentally firing missiles when you want to see the map, and the use of the triggers to look about and lock onto targets never feels completely right. Metroid's graphics are schizophrenic in a way; some minor details, like seeing Samus's eyes reflected in the visor in a bright glare, are spectacular, but others, like muddy shadows and simple enemies, are not. Lastly, Metroid Prime requires a lot of backtracking and going through places you've already seen, and that can get boring if you don't know where you're going. Hardcore Metroid players won't have a problem with that, but others might find it exhausting to keep revisiting the same old places over and over and over. Still, even with its minor problems, Samus's latest adventure is a perfect tribute to the Metroid we all know and love. Salute to Retro Studios and Nintendo for giving us the industry's Holy Grail-a next-gen game that significantly upgrades the genre while keeping all the classic feel of the original.

Nevertheless, with so many classic from Nintendo, Atari, Sega, and others to add on. For Sega to add on this nostalgia, they put their classic mascot that really franchised a dynamic level for Sega, Sonic The Hedgehog. Arguably, the blue character has been in some magnificent video games predicaments and mazes. Arguably, he was a true giant during the Genesis days. Sadly, Sega was never able to rebound in the video game wars after the Genesis. Still, the Sonic days still come and go.The Sonic Mega Collection, is a collection of seven great Sonic games from the Genesis days: Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3, Sonic Spinball, Sonic 3D Blast, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, and Sonic & Knuckles, as well as 5 hidden games to add on. The games from those 2D days were just completely outrageous and still filled with fast speeds and excitement. The games still remain as addictive as they did then, but a little more. The collection also includes 5 hidden games: Flicky, Blue Sphere, Rishtar, as well as the 2 lock-on games that were added on to Sonic & Knuckles, that put Knuckles into the game, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Knuckles in Sonic 2.The games were each remastered beautifully, without any flaws or detail missing from the Genesis days. The game also includes some extras as well, including the old Sonic comics that were issued from the mid 90's, well over 300 issues of them. Not only that, you see some trailers from clips from different games including Sonic CD, which was overlooked for this collection, as well as a video about the making of Sonic The Hedgehog. All in all this is truly a game for the record books. Sega has done this time & time again with their own systems, Saturn, Dreamcast, and the PC, but the graphics are crisper here, and the gameplay control is just as simple as it was during the Genesis days.I'm just surprised this kind of collection hasn't been issued on any other console whether it is Playstation 2, Xbox, or the Game Boy Advance. Still, if you have missed the Genesis days from then, you get a second chane here with Sonic The Hedgehog, Knuckles, Tails, and the rest of the gang here on the Gamecube.

One is a tetris/puzzle bobble/tetris attack variation while the other is a pseudo-3D game from an isometric perspective. Its nice to have them for completion purposes, but thats about it. Sonic Spinball is a cool (if hard) pinball variation.The real fun is in the 4 traditional platformers, ranging from Sonic 1 to Sonic and Knuckles. All four stand the test of time very well, with catchy music, tight controls, and colorful graphics. Sonic 3 is probably the weakest, as it's rather short and seems more mean-spirited about where hazards are placed, but its still a fun time. As a side note, the variations of the Sonic and Knuckles"" lock-on cart are also included as bonuses.So what's missing? Sonic CD, which is rumoured to be on the next mega collection (the videos are here though). A save function (apart from Sonic 3) would also have been nice.

A2582KMXLK2P06,B00006M3R6,B. E Jackson,1,1,"Metroid Fusion is a really good game.  At first I wasn't blown away since the storyline is really lacking and barely interesting enough to make an impression for the most part, but the feeling of being secluded in a trap-filled, enemy lurking planet -a reason I STRONGLY believe the original Metroid is such a classic in fact- is kept fully intact and perhaps succeeds moreso than every other Metroid game released after Metroid II: Return of Samus.  Yes that's right- as awesome and highly praised as Super Metroid is, the truth of the matter is that it lacks the feeling of being stuck in a gigantic planet (since the game seems sort of small to me).  Unfortunately the Metroid Prime series is equally as guilty (an exception would be the dark world portions of Echoes).The only reason I'm knocking a point is due to the abundance of similarities to Super Metroid.  Most of the same enemies from that game make a return here.  However the boss fights are completely different, though more simplistic to figure out and less fun to defeat as a result (a problem the original Metroid has as well, might I add).  Basically the boss fights do have a strategy, but most of the time all you have to do is walk into the fight shooting missiles or charged shots and that's enough to finish the battle.I could also complain that Metroid Prime has sort of spoiled gamers into thinking each and every Metroid game should be 10 hours long, however I won't dare forget my childhood- I grew up with hour long NES games and 2 or 3 hour long Super NES games.  The length feels right at home to me.The music is really creepy and appropriate in the icy and water portions, and melodic and very Metroid-like in the navigation room areas.  Animations are slightly choppier overall compared to the endless gushing framerate of Super Metroid.  Again, these are minor issues.  The fact that many of Metroid Fusion's missile expansions and energy tanks are cleverly hidden more than any other Metroid game is probably the games biggest strength.  I mean several of these items are *really* well hidden.  You'll need a map or well-written walkthrough in order to find them all.Overall, a fantastic Metroid game.  Don't spend more than 20 bucks for it however.  These 100-200 dollar brand new purchases I'm seeing at the moment are a total scam.

A36UKFV79879MD,B00006M3R6,BX Lounger,0,0,"Metroid Fusion AKA Metroid 4 continues from where Super Metroid left off. In 2002, this great game was released for the Game Boy Advance to the delight of many fans of the franchise and was a smash hit. So for those lucky enough to buy it at the time like me, it was great to play from start to finish.Metroid Fusion continues from the classic SNES game in which Samus Aran assists in a mission to eradicate Metroids in a planet she previously visited. Things go horribly wrong when she is attacked by a parasite that poisons and ulitmately threatens to kill her. She pulls through after receiving a vaccine but not before she had parts of her suit removed because of the infestation, thereby losing her trademark abilities. And things get worse as the space station she is staying at gets attacked by the same parasite that almost kills her and looks just like her and possesses all of her abilities. You take control of Samus Aran once again, stripped of all her abilities and this is where the game starts.The story is now different because you are constantly hunted by the parasite disguised as you so you are always on the move. Along the way, you can pick up various items to make you powerful. You will also be aided by a super computer, guiding you on your mission as well as sending you to data rooms"" to download new abilities. For those who have played Metroid games, then you are used to the exploration that is accustomed to games of this nature. There is a main world followed by 6 elavators that take you to sub worlds.The PROS: This game is huge but it is fun as well. The presentation is typical Metroid fashion so it's great. The graphics and sounds are as good as it gets while the music sets the mood, changing often depending on where you are in the game. The controls are easy to get into and get used to so you won't have any problems controlling Samus. What's also good about this game is that Nintendo shakes things up a bit: Samus is now the one that's hunted and normal abilities like the Screw Attack, Varia Suit and etc. are now attained when you beat the bosses that inhabit each world (you absorb them instead of getting a special item.) And getting the 100% item completion means you will be kept busy trying to locate every single item by using all of your abilities. Lastly, after you beat the game, you can connect the GBA and Gamecube (Metroid Prime) to unlock bonus content.The CONS: None whatsoever. I can't possibly think of anything that hinders the game at all.There is a reason why this game commands such a high price for those who want a brand new copy. If you are somewhat interested in this game or are a long time Metroid fan, there is no reason to not have this game. Get this used since it will be easier to purchase and see what you've been missing.

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00006M3R6,"Cloud ...""""",0,0,"There's always parts of the Metroid series that kind of confused me as to why I like it. Part of it is that I always loved games where point A to point B"" was relatively simple. Not that I want easy games but I like games where I can just pick up and go and after a bit of brainteasing, I figure out where next to go whereas in this series you can explore continously and still find more than you thought was there. With the first Prime being my favorite, Fusion is another one of those games where it's expertly done and well-crafted but you end up treating it unfairly to other games, either in the series or in general.Story: More story-extensive than anything (that is, until Corruption), Samus was infected by a strange parasite known as X while on SR 388. Almost dead, scientists use a Metroid-based vaccine to cure her but while on the space station, the parasite breaks out and quickly infects the various areas. Not to mention a Samus-like enemy, the SA-X, is after her and with the help of a computer AI named Adam, Samus has to rid the station of X before it infects other planets and civilizations.Graphics: With the help of some cutscenes, the story in Fusion feels more grander than before and through rather simplistic screens (i.e an image of Samus with overlayed text) it's a more immersive story. As far as the ingame graphics are concerned, they're fairly commonly seen and everything is as it should be but it has a bit more detail and levels have a bit more going for them.Sound/Music: As always, the music has that otherworldly quality to them where it's quite haunting and eerily beautiful in its orchestration as the music is meant to help support the gameplay rather than be its own catchy tune a la Final Fantasy music. It might not be a downloadable soundtrack but it's a pleasure to have on anyway, that is if you like that ambient stuff.Gameplay: Same old, really. Samus starts with barely anything and through exploration, upgrades her suit and weapons which include staples such as the morph ball, charge beam and various suits. My one complaint is that there wasn't a lot brand new. Most of it I've seen before and aside from one upgrade I probably haven't seen yet in the 2D ones, everything feels too familiar. Also, many people might not like the hand holding the game does since every new area or objective completed has you go to a navigation room where Adam will tell you what to do next, even say with red arrows (literally) what room it's in. I didn't like this and preferred Prime where it told you the specific room but not exactly the route on how to best get there.The difficulty is fine aside from the bosses since like most of the series, the bosses can easily whomp you and quite a few almost made me throw the DS across the room since it felt too unfair at times. I don't mind a game that challenges me and keeps me on my toes but games where quick wits and careful playing still nets you game over screens just isn't my idea of fun but I guess it balances out the game: easy exploration, tough-as-nails bosses.It might not be my favorite entry of the series but any Metroid really tends to be worth a playthrough and Fusion is no different.""",4,A solid entry into the franchise,2005/11/19 0:00

The only other one I have ever played so far is Metroid Pinball, so I'm totally not clued-up on the original that appeared on the NES back in 1986. But I did go for this one because I heard that the original Turrican game was based partly on Metroid.And while the similarities are plentiful this is still a great game in it's own right. Old-fashioned 2D platformers are always brilliant and it's one of my fave genres. Fusion involves lots of running around in a huge, abandoned space-station, visiting my departments and sub-departments, blasting away at alien scum and trying to figure out what happened to everyone. The level designs are awesome, with loads of hidden extras and secret passageways. You'll still be able to memorise your way around though.The graphics and sound effects are dead cool but the generic music is a bit of a let-down. Some of the bosses are unbelievably hard and you'll end up having to stop yourself from smashing your Nintendo against the wall. Fight the urge, there is always a way, always a pattern to follow to kill them. But it's finding the courage to face it for the 86th time that really matters.Definitely one of the best games on the GBA, but perhaps a bit too short.

For those who have played a Metroid game before, Samus (Metroid's heroine) has been infected by a parasite. A parasite that has now infected everything onboard a space lab! A lab is not exactly a world; in fact it is blatantly divided into eight levels. Samus is lucky though, because she is already infected, so every mutated monster that she reverts to its normal self (by shooting it), the parasite leaves the body, where Samus can catch the parasite for energy or a replenishment of missiles, but if she does not, the parasite can fly around to find another creature to mutate. Basically enemies can indeed come back to life. There are an entirely new cast of enemies, monsters and bosses, but the most interesting enemy is a clone of Samus that follows just a step behind! The game is very straight forward, there are many features for Gameboy Advance, such as save points are everywhere, there are places to fill up your energy all the way, and everything is easy to find because of navigation rooms that make a map and mark where you should go, so that way it keeps the game moving forward.

Anyway, the story of the game is pretty basic, doesnt seem to major at first but it stays gripping untill the game is beat.

But wait, not just creatures. There is also a creature that mimics you, yes Samus but is much stronger and deadly. Its name is SA-X. X is the name of the infected parisites in the game. And the whole game is going from enviornment to enviornment to beat bosses and get upgrades to fight SA-X and save the ship. Now for the real review. The controls are quite simple and could be mastered for an average gamer. The grapics are you ordinary GBA and SNES graphics and same type of music. It is a side scrolling adventure/nonvionlent shooter game that people from all ages should love. Like all other Metroid games, it does take some brain to complete.

A2582KMXLK2P06,B000084318,B. E Jackson,1,1,"Update- July 21, 2013I'm playing this game again after many years and oh my, what a big disappointment.  It doesn't hold up at all!  A big name Zelda title is supposed to be the greatest day next to Christmas.  Wind Waker admittedly does a lot of things right but the trade off is that it does WAY more things wrong.  Where to begin with this mess...Let's begin with the dungeons.  All of them are boring and colorless in appearance, unnecessarily overlong and confusing to figure out.  It's not like in the 2D Zelda games where sword cutting action is combined with creative puzzles- THESE dungeons are 80% puzzles and 20% action.  Having to run through gigantic nearly-empty rooms with eerie music in the background doesn't qualify as epic either.  Nice try Nintendo.  The two dungeons that are most unforgivable are the water dungeon (Tower of the Gods) and the one that involves having to babysit... er, team up with a female bird lady character named Medli and help her through the dungeon (Earth Temple).  Even though Link and Medli work together, it still feels more like babysitting.  While the dungeon puzzles are honestly thought-provoking and you will feel a great sense of accomplishment upon figuring them out, these two dungeons are the reason I'm not going back to this game ever again.  Do you *really* want to persevere this kind of torture again?  These aren't the kind of puzzles you ever desire to repeat.  Not when they take forever just to get through.  Even if you were to attempt a speedrun through these dungeons, the tedious nature of grinding through puzzle after puzzle assures you won't be speedrunning at a pace you'd prefer.The water dungeon is probably the worse of the two, but then again, maybe not.  I wasn't stuck on it nearly as long as the Earth Temple but on the other hand, the obstacles I faced were probably a lot worse.  The best way to describe the dungeon is like this- the first half is occupied with flooded rooms where the water raises and lowers approximately every 10-15 seconds, and the second half is all about a series of tedious statue-pushing puzzles.  When I say the water goes up and down I mean exactly that- you have to *wait* for the water to rise or lower because Link will then be able to swim to a platform or room within reach.  This is all totally required on the part of the player if you actually want to complete the dungeon and of course, that's why you're playing the game.  You *have* to deal with the moving waters.  In one unbelievably horrific room, you have to light a torch and jump across a series of perfectly lined up crates floating on top of the water.  Oh but that's not all.  If you miss you'll jump in the water, which means your flame will go out and you'll have to re-light the torch and attempt to move across the crates once again.  And you have to line up the crates when the water temporarily recedes so there's a proper and accurate path for Link's jumping.  If not for Ocarina of Time's water dungeon, this would unquestionably be a STRONG contender for the worst dungeon ever made.The other dungeon I mention involves the female bird lady character (Medli) where you have to do a series of tedious tasks that involve lifting her up and carrying her around or she'll get stuck behind.  She's also often needed to pick up and fly around Link to high or faraway platforms/places, and the main theme seems to be taking your shield (or Medli's shield) and reflecting the light that shines through ceiling or wall cracks in order to break open more passageways, chests or secrets, giving you access to the next area.  Your shield is basically used as a weapon in these instances.  At first it seems creative but you have to do this same task over and OVER again, and since each room serves more as overlong puzzles, you'll be stuck in this castle for hours.  I guarantee it.  Wouldn't be so bad if the enemies (such as those high-pitched screaming skeletons that freeze Link in place) were more abundant instead of scarce.  The one thing that REALLY annoys me is that you have to play melody commands"" to activate Medli a certain way.  You have to do this so many times, not just here but throughout the game, that it totally overstays its welcome after a while.  It's out of place in a Zelda game.  Just because Link played the flute in the 2D games does NOT give Nintendo the right to stretch out this unbearable mini musical story for all its worth in the sequels.  Overdone, boring and unnecessary.  In the Wind Temple, you have to guide a little mechanical propeller-lifting chicken-like thing called Makar (at least, it *looks* like a skinned chicken don't you think?) to higher areas/platforms to activate blocks and other things.  The fun wears thin when the realization that you have to do this same task over and over creeps in.  A poor attempt at designing dungeons Nintendo.  Shame on you.You already know the next problem I'm going to mention since it's been said a thousand times by now.  The actual sailing to get from one island to another takes forever with little in the way of doing anything interesting along the way.  The sail boat moves incredibly slow, and even though sometimes you might talk to a helpful fish for advice and discover treasure chests full of rupees, trifocre charts/shards or heart container pieces along the way (and even a boring rupee-collecting mini game involving a boat race later on) none of these things make up for the tediousness of waiting... and waiting... and falling asleep!  and waiting some more, until your boat arrives to your destination.  Ugh.  You can control the boat anywhere you want but it's not like there's a whole lot to do.  I realize a lot of people dislike the bird flying in Skyward Sword because it takes a while to arrive to your desired island in that game as well, but at least it's more heroic, soaring and adventurous watching Link riding a bird and closing in on an approaching island.  Here... with a sail boat... it just doesn't deliver the same kind of excitement.  Though granted, the peaceful serenity of the nighttime sailing is pretty cool especially when you glance at the moon and stars above, and I even like when danger occasionally occurs (such as swarming sharks and cannonballs later on) because it adds a bit of suspense.  I mean you're on a mere sail boat and here comes danger!  This isn't as threatening of a situation as you might be thinking, however.Several of the errands you do in town are so bad it makes me crings just thinking about them.  Having to snap photos of a man and woman when they're together or when a man is putting mail in the town mailbox?  REALLY annoying.  Starting up a ferris wheel?  Delivering love letters to characters who don't even deserve to be loved?  Chasing school children in a hide and seek game so you can impress the school teacher who's nothing but a snotty high and mighty, unappreciative nobody?  She only cares about money and being glamorous and is someone that in reality I'd avoid like the plague!  The picture rearranging games you sometimes discover on the walls of one or two rooms are really annoying too and not worth the reward for completing them (50 rupees if I remember).  There's a few other instances of errand-related annoyances, some of which are requirements.  The one where you have to crawl through a series of crawl spaces in maze-like fashion is confusing since every room looks exactly the same but thankfully this area is short, and the other one where you have to figure out which doors with a flame above them leads to your prize at the end feels like yet another waste of time but, again, it's short.On the flipside, I can name three mini games that are awesome.  The auction bidding is the most noticeable one.  It's fairly realistic and pretty fun too, especially the tension you feel after you make a high bid and you nervously count down the seconds anticipating if anyone's going to top your bid.  The battleship mini game is really fun.  I could probably spend 30-45 minutes on this game alone.  The guy in charge of the battleship game is the worst human being I've ever seen in a Zelda game.  Completely unfunny.  And the leaf parachute game where the object is to float across the water and strategically use the tornadoes to elevate your height so you can reach the finish line is the best of the bunch.  These are really entertaining games.The boss fights are alright though most of them are quite easy to take down.  In fact other than Ganon, they're *all* easy to take down.  Maybe the strategies were fairly complex back in 2003, but these bosses are too simplistic and boring these days.  The one where you have to battle a gigantic bird on a rooftop is WAY too reminiscent of the Ridley fight from Metroid Prime.  Even his attack and flying patterns are similar.  The only difference is that you're using a sword instead of an arm cannon obviously since this is a Zelda game.  Ganon's first battle at the end of the game is basically a 3 dimensional version of the Moldorm worm from Link to the Past but a much faster and harder way of damaging.  This part of the fight offensively requires luck to defeat- just hope you'll be standing near Ganon's weak point ready to strike when he speeds by.  A final boss fight should always be strategic instead of lucky.  The cel-shading graphics were the topic of conversation back in the day but now they look sort of dark, uninteresting and overbearingly cutesy.  Link and Zelda have ugly eyes and heads, and their bodies aren't pretty either.  Some of the characters such as the pirate named Miss Tetra are really awesome, but fail in comparison to the greater variety and diversity that Link to the Past and Skyward Sword's character selection presents.  The Miss Tetra storyline takes a drastic horrible turn later on when... ugh.  I can't spoil it.  All potential pertaining to the pirate storyline falls apart once *this* happens.The enemy combat usually consists of being able to walk up to most armored guards/blob creatures (and a few others) and slash them to death with your sword.  Some of them require the leaf, bow and arrow or bombs to destroy however.  Even though dealing with them is really easy, we can't overlook that it's also *really* darn fun.  Usually the guards (Darknuts) don't pose much of a threat, but sometimes you will have to prepare to move Link out of the way of a lunging sword attack.  This is usually in the later half of the game.  It gets especially dangerous when there's 3 or more Darknuts on screen.  You may have to execute some stellar sword trickery to escape.  I LOVE that one super spin attack that enables Link to spin around with his sword like a hurricane for 10 seconds and basically eliminate a room full of problems, or at the very least severely damage everything in sight.  It's awesome.  Like I say above, the melody (button) commands are awful due to this being a requirement WAY too often.  You HAVE to do this in order to change the direction of the wind so your sail boat can reach the island of your choice.  Having to frequently command a melody to steer your sail boat to another direction/location gets boring after a while, and as I say above, doing it in the castles gets especially tiresome and reduntant.I like some of the items and weapons Link uses.  The rope is a nifty way of swinging across branches to reach high or faraway areas, and the leaf parachute offers a similar function.  I LOVE the impactful beauty and effects of launching ice and fire arrows at a target as well.  The bow and arrow is a dangerous weapon as you'd expect since it's Zelda where the bow and arrow has always been crucial for survival.  This weapon is especially helpful and frequent in Wind Waker it seems.  These items and weapons really bring out the adventurous surroundings.  The game is overall very generous with the rupees as well.  You'll be collecting them by the bucket load.  They have yellow and purple rupees which adds up your amount rather fast.  Silver rupees hidden in chests under the water can reward you with 200 rupees, and orange rupees give 100.  Red rupees are back (worth 20).  Blue and green ones too.  Insanely generous.  Unless you haven't been collecting them, you'll probably have close to 5,000 by the final dungeon.  The swinging of the sword flows remarkably well.  There's no confusion in how you want to attack an enemy either.  Your sword won't ever let you down in the heat of a battle, nor will Link's movements.  The game encourages you to walk right up to enemies and slice 'em up.  If you don't, well, they seem to back off and wander around the room for a while giving you plenty of time to make preparations for another attack.  Simply put, enemies usually aren't as relentless as YOU are which may be a good thing since it means the game is hardly ever overly difficult.What I HATE however is the overlong fetch quest concerning the triforce shards and the charts.  You have to find BOTH the charts and the shards in the open water which can take several hours of searching.  You'll be sailing around for a while, but an even bigger problem is that it's unnecessary to even *have* such a quest after all the hours of boat sailing that has already taken place by this point.  This entire quest is overkill and I despise it.  I'm not too crazy about having to re-fight the bosses again at the end of the game either.  This time the colors on screen change to black and white perhaps a way to make the adventure feel more intense, and when you land the final blow you're simply transported back to the dungeon to take on the next boss.  It's... strange to say the least.  There's no feeling of satisfaction when you defeat them once again.  Then again, like I say above, there's no feeling of satisfaction anyway due to the bosses being easy overall.  Though I suppose it works in a ""reminiscing over previous encounters"" kind of way which illustrates how far Link has come since his sister went missing/introduction of Miss Tetra near the beginning.Wind Waker encourages more exploring than sword combat, so be prepared to spend more time exploring for items and treasures and less time fighting.  This means exploring many and I mean MANY empty islands with nothing but grass, high cliffs and trees everywhere.  Many of these islands contain caves or holes where items and chests are hidden, some of which provide decent atmosphere I admit.  After all falling in a big hole and landing near streams and being surrounded by high mountains is a unique feeling of adventure.  However there are two particularly offensive rooms near the end of the game where you keep falling through hole after hole (about 30 of them total) fighting 90% of the enemy varities you've already encountered which may be cool and serves as a nice combat-oriented mission, but feels like a clumsy way of making up for the lack of combat you experienced up to this point.  Like Nintendo just tacked this section on to make up for the distinct lack of combat throughout the game.  I'd bet anything that these two parts of the game contain more than 50% of the enemies in the game overall.  Why not spread these enemies around the dungeons and the islands?The music however, is INCREDIBLE!  Perhaps the best soundtrack ever in a Zelda game.  The soothingly beautiful credits theme is amazing beyond description, but my favorite is the fast-paced Jethro Tull or Renaissance like theme music that plays whenever you arrive to a mini boss.  It's diverse enough to be classified as a progressive rock song, seriously.  Just LISTEN to how awesome it is!  Other songs are really melodic and fit in appropriately and excitedly with the heroic theme of the fairy tale locations the Zelda series is known for.  Oh and perhaps my favorite part of the game- the dramatic and uneasy music you hear whenever you encounter an enemy.  It's suspenseful and makes you feel paranoid, threatened and overwhelmed by the upcoming danger.  It's *awesome*.  There's even some perfectly utilized sound effects while this particular theme is playing giving off a feeling of mystery and uncertainty.  I don't particularly care for the annoying sounds Link makes though.  He should have remained silent.  At least we can breathe easy knowing the one ice section later on is short because Link sliding around sounds like a baby animal being massacred by a group of wild barbarians.  Oh and speaking of which, these ice and fire dungeons shouldn't technically be considered dungeons since they're only one or two rooms long.  It literally only takes 2 minutes to complete them.Overall, go with Skyward Sword for a better 3D representation instead.  That game better represents the Zelda formula on all counts especially graphics, storytelling and overall epicness (but not music though- Wind Waker takes the crown there).  Wind Waker just doesn't provide much in the way of substance or pacing.  The triforce chart/shard quest is a big, extremely overlong letdown almost making you not want to finish the game.  How many times have I wanted to give up on a Zelda game due to boredom?  Never before.  The islands should have been closer together too.  This would have helped trim down on the unnecessary length of the game.""",2,really misses the mark in several areas,2006/11/14 0:00
A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B000084318,blackaciddevil,1,1,"The story of The Wind Waker takes place on a series of islands on the sea somewhere, a first for the series. It tells about Link and his struggle with Ganondorf for control of the Triforce. He spends a good portion of his time trying to find his little sister, who's kidnapped at the beginning of the game. He also spends a portion of his time sailing, traveling through dungeons and temples and the like on his quest to gain power to defeat Ganondorf yet again.Personally, I don't understand what all the hoopla was about. Back before this game came out, Zelda fans cried foul because the game went cel-shaded, claiming it was geared more towards kids. Once you boot this game up and begin to play, you'll find out this game is still pure Zelda. Besides, sometimes a series needs change to stay alive and fresh. I love it myself and I've been a loyal Legend of Zelda gamer for years. It ranks up there with my other favorites(like Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask,The Minish Cap and Twilight Princess).Gameplay in the game goes largely unchanged from the scheme in Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask. There's tons of side-quests to do, besides what you do on the quest, that are (as always) alot of fun. My favorite being when Link obtains what they call the Deluxe Picto Box(camera) that he uses to take pictures of enemies and non-playable characters for a character named Carlov, who uses them to sculpt figurines(134, in all). I think the thing I like most about The Wind Waker is that Link can pick up and use certain enemy's weapons.The cool thing about The Wind Waker is that the story doesn't end here. It continues on in Legend of Zelda:Phantom Hourglass for the Nintendo DS, which follows Link as he journeys to save his friend Tetra from Bellum(the story's antagonist) with the help of Captain Linebeck and his ship, the S.S. Linebeck.I highly recommend Legend of Zelda:The Wind Waker to one and all. It's an adventure that, like Ocarina of Time, shouldn't be missed.",5,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.......,2010/9/13 0:00

No, this isn't Columbine, or the recent war in Iraq, or Clinton's sexcapades, it was the Legend of Zelda demo from Spaceworld 2001.  Instead of the ultra-realistic and mondo cool"" demo from 2000, we now have something that looks like Saturday Morning's cartoon lineup.  Admittedly, it's strange seeing my favorite characters(the 3 main ones in every Zelda) in cel-shaded graphics, the thought soon vanished afterwards.Story: Link is living on Outset Island and celebrating his birthday when his sister(another change from before) gives him the classic Green Tunic, then Link sees a girl being dropped in a nearby forest. He rescues her but then his sister, Aryll, is kidnapped by a big bird.  He then sets off on a rescue mission and gets caught up in the ancient legends of old.Graphics: People absolutely were divided on these graphics. Some liked the change, others said ""let me play it first"", others didn't give it a chance and just completely dismissed it saying they wouldn't even bother playing it at all, which is a shame cause these are just beautiful. Fluid animation, wide facial expressions and great bosses(dare you not to exclaim ""holy **** he's huge!"" if you get to the Dragon Roost Island boss).Sound/Music: It's not orchestrated, which is a bummer, but it's great music nonetheless.  Voice is basically like Ocarina/Majora(no actual speech, just the occasionally laugh, moan and scream).Gameplay: the critical factor with games and Zelda delivers, and then some. Taking the Z-targeting and making it L, it's pretty much the same as Ocarina/Majora.  Except now, Link has some new items, like a boomerang which can hit multiple targets.  Where the game loses points is the open sea. Yes, a huge portion of your playing time will be spent out on the sea, sailing.

APS7IH14C8AZ9,B000084318,"M. King The super mario nerd""""",0,0,"This game is great. I love all Zelda games, and i gotta say this is one of my favorites along with Twilight princess, A Link to the Past, and of corse both of the 64 ones. Well I like the more realistic type of zeldas better than these with toon link but i still really LOVE this game. I could write a whole walkthrough on this but i wont. So i will just go over the basics. When you first start, as link. You are on your home island Outset island"" and on a tower looking over the sea. Your little sis gives you a telescope and tells you that grandma ""you live with her"" has something for your birthday. You get some new clothes that you wear the rest of the game. Its green and has a hat. After you explore your smallish home island, this huge bird comes down and drops this girl in the forest on your island. You will find your sword in your house and go rescue her. She is a pirate and you want to go with her on an expidition and she doesnt want you at first. When she does she tells you that you will need a shield of some sort than you can go. The reason you want to go is because the bird that dropped the pirate in the woods took your sister and the pirates are going after it to get back their whatever the bird took from them ""i forgot, it was quite a while ago"" As you go with them you have to complete tasks and stuff to get things, as soon as you get to the place the bird took you sister. You have to complete the first main part of the game. As the game goes on you get a boat named king which comes very helpful. Without him there would be no game. You travel around the Great sea to big or small islands and each big island has a perl to get when you beat the boss of it. Well there is only three islands but a great story for each one. In each place you battle you will find some usfull items to help beat the bosses. Later after the perls and stuff you need to get the triforce shards. Eight of them to be exact. And to find them you need to find the maps to them, and to get the maps. You need to beat things and find them. And to read the maps you will need LOTS of rupees to give to tingle to read them for you. Yes lots of steps. When you find them you complete it and you are ready to go to Hyrule and find and beat Gannondorf. You really have four stages of him to bead and each one gets harder. I beat him with one hit away from being completly dead. Well thats the main points of the game. I took me probably around 30 to 40 hours to beat it completly. 100% done. There are many hidden things and stuff to do in this game that are very fun to find. After you beat the game it will ask you if you want to save a special slot. When you restart it on that special save some things will be different, like Links' clothes will be different and so on. But this is one of my favorite games i have ever played in my life, excellent storyline, it has one of the best story out of all Zeldas. So if you never have played this game, at least give it a chance. If this was the only game made for the GameCube, i would buy it and the GameCube for big bucks just to play this. Just look at the reviews!""",5,The Wind Waker. What a spectacular experience.,2009/6/24 0:00
A3PASG15BRR40D,B000084318,SleepyJD,3,0,"After 2 years Miyamoto releases his next big monster, Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.  While it does have a childish cartoony look to it, the gameplay is classic zelda, and a little bit more.  Now you have the option to pick up items off the ground and use them as weapons.  This is an awesome feature, unlike anything ever seen in a zelda game.  Beating enemies with these items is very satisfying and is a welcome addition to the Zelda series.  The second highly noticable feature is the GBA to GC link up.  If you have a Game Boy Advance, or Game Boy Advance SP, and you have the GBA to NGC link, you can play Wind Waker with 2p CoOp play!  That's right, for the first time in history a Zelda console game allows two people to play the game at once.  Player 1 is obviously link, while player 2 is tingle.  Tingle is represented by a marker on the ground and can drop bombs for a small charge.  The player controlling Tingle can look at the GBA screen because it presents a full map showing where Link is.  The map screen also gives helpful tips on what to do.  Overall, if you own a GameCube, you'd be a ... not to try this game out.

AQMWZIH22R6LE,B000084318,"TwistaG Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore""""",2,2,"Look to the center of the console adventure gaming galaxy, and there you will find Link. Every heart piece you've ever collected and gem you've gathered, every block you've pushed and wall you've bombed open, every Dark World you've visited and 3D sword-lock you've acquired-all these things stem from Shigeru Miyamoto's incremental innovations in arranging adventure game 1s and 0s. This time, however, our Hero's had an inspiration of a different sort. Few things in this life have gotten gamers as riled up as the Great Kiddifying of Young Master Link; chances are you'd already convinced yourself whether you love Cel-da or hate him before you'd even played the game. For the cel-haters, no amount of gushing is gonna change your mind-even if you heard that the quality of the liquid watercolor animation rivals (heck, surpasses) Disney's best, or that the game's spirit taps into the same natural-mystical kid/adult crossover zone occupied by the finest films of Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke). For the cel-lover, The Wind Waker will be the adventure of a lifetime...a combination of vivid artistry and timeless gameplay that radiates magic shiny happy life light. Miyamoto's goal has always been to make sure that everything that goes into his games only serves to make them more fun...features lists and demographic data be damned. In that regard, The Wind Waker doesn't stray from the winning formula that's made the series such a smashing success. The Overworld still holds more secrets than you'll ever find. Dungeons contain the standard assortment of maps, new tools, and boss battles. Even Link's new baton is essentially a dressed-up version of the Ocarina of Time as you learn various songs to open doors, transport across the map, and change night into day. There are still blocks to push and chests to open-though all of this is handled with a bit more wisdom and a bit more refinement. The game features fewer dungeons"" in the traditional sense, but the ones that are here tend to be huger and more challenging with new twists (several of the more ingenious ones have you leading around another character, Ico-style, to solve puzzles). Later in the game, the notion of ""dungeons"" is all but overthrown by a series of wonderfully elaborate treasure hunts that are sure to tax even the most accomplished Zelda gamer.The biggest (non-Celda-related) change comes in the way the Overworld is presented: as a vast ocean, set in a 7x7 grid, each square containing an island with something to find-a heart container piece or rupee stash at the least, an entire bird-person city or multi-level dungeon at the most. Each island is surrounded by tons of other stuff to tax your to-do list: some magic fish to find, some unexpected mini racecourse to traverse, some shark to kill, some random treasure trove to yank up from the brine. In many ways, the structure resembles Westwood's underappreciated Pirates: The Legend of Black Kat. While trekking between islands threatens to become tedious, there's always a million somethings to do on the way if you're so inclined-treasure maps to decipher, giant squids to encounter, submarines to pilfer, Great Fairies to free. Even so, the game's surprisingly non-linear, exploration-nurturing nature often requires patience and sturdy sea legs for backtracking. Combat is a supreme joy-it incorporates Ocarina's lock-on system, though new additions like countering and disarming are a cause for celebration (combos create awesome Looney Tunes-y ""dynamic soundtracks""), and experimenting on foes with your newly acquired tools generates lots of happy fun hormone. You'll rarely die, and while the boss battles are glorious, they're not exactly tough. More fun/less frustrating is the game's fighting philosophy. Unfortunately, the camera can really freak out on you, and you'll often find yourself in first-person mode when you meant to be locked on. Where things get truly challenging is in the puzzles: For most of the game, the fun-to-frustration ratio is pitch perfect, but be warned that you will get stuck as the Wind Waker has a knack for turning the most mundane box-pushing puzzle into a test for a Mensa membership. Take, for example, the Earth Dungeon, which does for ""reflecting light"" what Ocarina of Time did for ""changing water levels."" All this, of course, is stitched together by one of the most creative and beautiful worlds ever conceived and brought to life...not just in video gaming, but in the whole realm of animation, film, and art. While The Wind Waker may be a bit too complex for the young, it's definitely made for the young at heart. The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker dares to defy the notion that games need to be more ""gritty and realistic"" by choosing instead to become exactly the opposite. Link's is an adventure as old as time, but it feels like the most refreshing game in the world thanks to creative daring, insanely superior production values, and-above all-gameplay that would be fun even if Link were five colors, 16 pixels, and carried a blue monochrome block for a sword""",5,A very engrossing adventure,2003/9/20 0:00

Many of the Marios can be classic(except I hate part 2 and only liked"" Sunshine), Mario 3 can definately be called a classic. Released waaaay back on the old NES system, many people were spellbound by the gameplay and the mechanics of having multiple suits and power-ups, expanding on the flower and mushroom power-ups.Story: Ha, you're expecting a story in a Mario game? It all boils down to one sentence: there's trouble in the Mushroom Kingdom and Mario must save the day. That's it. To do that, he must clear at least 90 stages and face many enemies.Graphics: It's NES so they're not exactly that great but in the end you just don't end up noticing. It's certainly an improvement from 2 and the different worlds are nicely detailed but face it, you don't play an old-school game for the graphics.Sound/Music: Back when Nintendo re-released Link to the Past on the GBA, they added some voice clips from the N64. Well same thing with Mario 3, when Mario gets a power-up he goes ""just what I needed"" and it's slightly annoying but since you're not gonna get power-ups one right after another it's not as troublesome.Gameplay: The most important aspect of a game and Mario 3 certainly delivered. Adding to the list of power-ups is the Leaf, giving Mario a tail and ears, allowing him to fly. Also added is the Hammer suit, capable of throwing hammers, the Tanooki suit which is similar to the Leaf but allows Mario to turn into a statue briefly, making enemies ignore him. Also is the frog suit which is more better suited at swimming and the oddly-popular shoe which allows safe passage over some terrain and stomping enemies.The world is separated into 8 sections and like many-a Mario game, it's got a theme. There's a desert area, a sky area, the favorite ""big world"" with large enemies, an ice world and so on. Also included is different special areas, such as a mix-and-match where you have to match a whole picture of a power-up, a memory based card game where you flip cards that have to match(2 tries? that's really stupid) and a game of picking 1 of 3 chests.By the way, this game can get incredibly frustrating. The first couple of levels are not that big of a deal but later levels will seriously drive you up the wall. World 6(ice world) and one stage on World 7(pipe/maze world) seriously made me yell in frustration.As an added bonus, the game comes with the original Super Mario Bros where you have to bump the ceiling of different floors and kick enemies.

Yet, there are just some classics that don't even come close to die. That does come through the case with Nintendo.

Since they began in the 80's the Mario Brothers video games have never died down for a not, although there have been a few minor flaws, the whole lifeline of the most influential character from a video game, has never taken the wrong step away from the public.Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Brothers 3, is a remake among the classic 1990 video game Nintendo released from its original NES game system. Through it all, it works extremely well, as Mario goes through 8 different worlds, with over 80 different courses and stages, to go head-tohead with the menacing Bowser and his kids, Morton, Lemmy, Larry, Ludwig, Roy, Wendy and Iggy. The games works very well, as a new introduction to a whole new audience, since 1993, when it was issued on the classic compilation, Super Mario All-Stars for the Super NES system. This works very well, but there is a downside. The feeling of using the e-reader device here, to unlock levels, and to pay an extra amount of cash for the e-reader, and the extra e-reader cards for access to new levels for Super Mario Bros. 3 is not a very good idea.

In 1990 this was THE game to get! It had the biggest selling release of all time until 1999 when the more than disappointing FFVIII came around.I'm not reviewing the NES one but rather the SNES one since that's the one we're going to get obviously! This is the best Mario game ever made! The only one that could possibly be better than this is probably Super Mario RPG on the SNES.I'll admit I was disappointed when Nintendo re-released Super Mario Brothers 2 and then they SKIPPED THE BEST MARIO GAME and came out with a re-release of Super Mario World and then Super Mario World 2.  I couldn't believe my eyes when I heard thatt they skipped this one!The reason why this is the greatest Mario game is because this focuses on EXACTLY what a game should focus on (Back 13 years ago especially) and that is gameplay! These days gameplay is what games tend to lack. They get tediously long (making you never want to go through it all again) and are much too focused on storyline that they forget what keeps people coming back to the game and that's gameplay.Graphically this was by far the best looking NES game in those days and on the SNES it was just so much better looking.  However, I can't say the same for the music. I LOVED the music on the NES version but in the SNES version the music got worse. Sadly because of the GBA it WILL be worse on the GBA (Super Mario Brothers 2 had worse music as well in it's re-releases).The controls scheme of course is top notch and easy to do as it is in most Mario games. If you're like me you were without a doubt a little displeased with Super Mario Sunshine.  But this game will make up for that.However, I still don't like that once again we're getting a RE-release of a classic game for the GBA. When are we going to get a NEW Mario game on the gameboy advance? We've been waiting FOREVER!Still, when this game is released remember the old NES days and the SNES days and you'll KNOW why this is the best Mario game of all time.",5,It's about time.,2003/8/21 0:00

Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories is the perfect game for the PSP.Let me say again - this is a MATURE game. There is sex, there is swearing, there is a LOT of violence. Anybody who buys this game for their 8 year old is making a grave mistake. It really bothers me a lot when people buy adult games for kids and say Oh I didn't know"". It clearly says right on the box. There are a TON of adult gamers out there, and we like mature games, just like we like R rated movies. These games aren't meant for kids. They are made exactly the way us adults like them - full of adult situations.That being taken care of, this is an *incredible* game. Let's start with the gameplay. It's hard to even imagine, looking at say a DS or GameBoy game, that any handheld could produce gameplay like this. You have a fully detailed, fully laid out cityscape. You can drive down any road, walk around amongst the people, watch the rain and sun and fog roll in. The storyline is great. The missions are great. Heck, even the sidegames are great. There are hidden packages to find, rankings to achieve, races to run, you name it. You could play this for months.The graphics are spellbindingly beautiful. It's hard to believe this is a handheld game. You get rain falling down around your car as it careens past easily identifiable stores on a road, while pedestrians stroll down the sidewalks. From shooting tasks, to driving races, to handling a number of other situations, the graphics draw you into this world.Let's talk about audio. There is a great selection of ""radio stations"" to listen to as you drive around. The voice acting really draws you into the story, to relate to the various characters involved. I've always loved the audio on the GTA games, and this is no exception.Yes, this game requires a 2.0 update to run. The update is INCLUDED ON THE DISK. Anybody who has trouble finding it must be missing some basic computer skills. It's right on the main disk menu when you put the disk into the system. It's free, it's included, it's easy.I can't say enough good things about this game. Let me try to figure out some down sides. Hmmm, well it's on a small screen. Heck, that's the whole point, that it's on a portable system. When I go on trips, I can bring it along with me. I think that's fantastic, to have a GTA system to bring on the plane or bus. I *did* find the storyline in general to be on the annoying side, truth be told. I really liked the original GTA3 storyline where you were a valued employee moving up in the ranks due to your skill. I found it frustrating in this one to play in essence an ""uppity jerk"" who is constantly put down either by his own mob buddies or his mom or other people. It didn't make the game nearly as enjoyable for me. This is my leisure time after all, to endulge in fun dreams. My fun dream isn't of being berated and harassed.  That being said, the mom in the Sopranos always drove me completely insane too. You have to give a writer the leeway to write his own story, and if that's what he wants to write, you go with it.This is a must-own game. It's a game for ADULTS.

It's actually quite fun, strategizing your order of attack and spinning into action!Your favorite characters of Star Fox are in trouble, and need to a series of enemies. First, you get the overall top-down map screen. Each character's ship can fly a certain amount of distance in a turn - simply draw a line to say where they go. Use the stylus to wipe out some of the 'fog of war', and your main ship can shoot missiles. You only have a certain number of turns available, so plan your movements wisely.When your ship encounters an enemy ship, you switch into real time combat. In this mode, you drag your stylus around on the bottom screen to steer"" while the top screen shows you where you're flying. You fly through rings to get power-ups, and shoot at enemies (with the D-pad on the left) to fire. It really is quite intuitive - no up/down, left/right issues. Simply drag your stylus as the ship flies. You spin your stylus in a circle to do the classic barrel roll, and there are two easy-access spots to tap to do a U-turn or a loop.I love space combat, and it was really fun to have this type of game available on a handheld. I kept expecting to put the game down after a mission - but I'd say ""just one more ..."" and keep going. Note that these missions aren't easy! Expect to have to replay some of them several times to get through. You do have to learn the strategies and tactics of three dimensional combat.The game expects you to go through a single pass rather quickly - but the beauty is that you then go back and re-play it, now having new options available at every stage. Instead of just contacting Slippy, now you have other choices you can do instead that are more difficult. You choose at each step what to do, and it affects the types of missions you take on and the endings you get to see. Think of it as built in difficulty levels.A key element of space combat games are the visuals - with you trying to move and think real time in three dimensions, it's critical that you can see the terrain, your enemies, and anything else that might get in the way. While the DS graphics in general are nice, it wasn't always easy to see what you were fighting. The graphics were sometimes unclear - the ship's faded graphic would blend right in to the background's faded graphic.Also, your ship is right in the center of the screen, and takes up a fair amount of it. This makes it challenging if you're right behind a ship, to see it. Surely they could have given you an in-cockpit view or at least a transparent ship.For vocals, they give you the high pitched gibberish that means it's perfect for all languages. No need to do new vocal tracks for this game! Still, in modern times, it would be nice to have a regular vocal track available. It adds a whole additional dimension of enjoyment when you have great voice actors bringing life to the characters.Still, this is a superb game for the DS, and one I really enjoy.

Usually Sonic is a rolling fiend, zipping along tracks. In this case, you can choose from one of four teams, each of different difficulty levels. For example, the 'Chaotix' team is made up of a bee, an alligator and a mysterious purple horned Sonic-like guy. The three run along levels together, gathering golden rings, beating up on monsters.Each character has his or her own special powers. If the 'flying' one of the group leads, the trio can now fly to higher levels. There's usually a fast member and a strong member in each group as well, for breaking objects and zooming along tracks.You have to figure out in each situation who to lead with, to get past the current obstacle. This might be easy on early levels, but it does get to be a tough challenge in later missions!The graphics are reasonably good, with nice details on surfaces, although it's sort of clear that textures were just mapped on rather bsic shapes. The maps are very large and you have full mobility through an entire map without loading times, so that's great.Each team is a different level of difficulty with its own characters, voices and plot - so it's great to start with the easy levels, learn how the characters and gameplay work, and then move up through the more difficulty levels. Yes, the easy levels are easy. They're meant to be! But there definitely is more challenge as you get to the harder levels, so play through to find your challenge level.In the beginning it's obvious which character to use in a situation, but as you work through the choices become harder and harder. The maps are so large that you can approach a given puzzle from many different directions, with any of the characters under your control.The music is actually pretty good for a game, but some of the voices are REALLY annoying.All in all, a great idea for a platformer. With so many platformers using pairs of characters now (Ratchet &amp; Clank, Jax &amp; Daxter etc) going to 3 was a natural progression.

A2TCG2HV1VJP6V,B0000VSH4U,Ryan Sil. (Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...,0,0,"Sonic has come a loooong way since his debut on the Sega Genesis. But during that long road, in the mid-2000s, he managed to hit a bunch of speed bumps. Then he was brought back to form with Sonic Colors and Sonic Generations. But how about we go to waaay before those titles? The game that was right before all of those speed bumps?Sonic Heroes features an interesting premise - Being able to control a group of 3 Sonic characters at the same time makes the cool action much more robust. You get a selection of 4 teams: Team Sonic (Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles -- Medium difficulty), Team Dark (Shadow, Rouge, Omega -- Harder difficulty), Team Rose (Amy, Cream, and.....Big -- Easy), and Team Chaotix (Vector, Charmy, Espio -- A unique take on the gameplay, as it offers missions rather than the usual reach-the-end goal).Each team would have formations that fit each of the 3 characters. There's speed, flying, and power. Whenever there's a certain obstacle in the way, the game would tell which formation to use (Meaning you must switch to the character of that formation). I guess it's nice for them to just tell us. After all, it provides a more straightfoward take on the 3D Sonics, not really slowing us down when it comes to having to know what to do (Except for Team Rose when playing their tutorial level...).Speaking of straightfoward, like I said, the game is all about reaching the end of each level, and when beating that level, you go to the next right away. No map, no talking to people, but just simple and to the point. While there are 3D masterpieces that go by that stuff (Mario 64, anyone? With the castle lobby? And certain Toads you talk to give you Stars?), Sonic Heroes proves that there are some cases where they're not needed. The gameplay itself is as perfect as any Genesis or Sonic Adventure-style Sonic game, except, of course, you've got 3 characters to toy with. Oh, yes, and the level design is top-notch.I never actually realized how aged the game feels compared to the more recent Sonic games. The voices are old, the cutscenes also show their age, and the storyline feels weak. Actually, it's quite interesting to see where Sega was going early on in Sonic's lifetime, so I guess it would be fun to notice the differences yourself. The story is still weak, though.Other than the story, the only bad thing about this game is the voice acting. It reeeallly sucks (Although Big's voice = Comedy gold. I keep laughing whenever he says something). Tails sounds like a girl (Of course, this would go on until Sonic Colors), One of Amy's screams is ear-bleeding (I turned down the volume during Team Sonic's battle with Team Rose), and there are sayings that keep being repeated. But personally, I think this is somewhat of a minor issue, as everything else is terrific. If you can get past the voice acting like I did, then you're in for a good time.",4,Right before 3D Sonic games became stale...,2012/1/8 0:00
A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B0000VSH4U,Simon,3,2,"After picking up the Sonic Mega Collection to experience the classics I never owned years ago, I decided to shell out for a new 3D Sonic game to see how the character had translated to 3D.There's a lot of good stuff here. When the characters pick up speed and start flying every which way, you're instantly reminded of what Sonic is really about. The levels are nicely varied, and some like the obligatory casino pinball stages are fantastic to look at and play through. The framerate never dips, and the levels guide you along on a set path without ever making you feel confined. Sonic isn't Mario, and subjecting him to exploratory missions wouldn't feel right.However, Sonic Heroes will also test your patience. The team idea of switching between 3 characters is novel, but constantly rotating between them gets tiresome. Also, having four teams feels a bit unnecessary. Everyone wants to play as Sonic, Tails and Knuckles, and Amy and Cream are decent additions. But the alligator and bee? A bulky robot and an oversized idiotic cat? It doesn't help that Sega went with the voice actors from the 4Kids Sonic X series, who seem to match their roles appropriately but speak in shrill, high-pitched tones (and speak they do...the characters can't seem to shut up sometimes). There are other, technical annoyances. Some levels seem to guide you through on auto-pilot, while others have you line up odd jumps that have you falling to your death (the rail canyon stages). Also, at an average of 5-6min per level, you're left wondering if things will end soon. I know Sega wants to extend playing value, but I'm not sure if this is how to do it.I've actually ended up listing more bad than good here, but this is still a fun game. The sense of speed and wonder outweigh the game's flaws, and it's worth the investment as a player's choice value title.

Sonic games are all about speed, instinct, and reflex-you run around dizzying loops, hoping you're fast enough to press the jump button before you fall on a bed of spikes. Sonic Heroes had the potential to take that concept to the next level, but somewhere along the road to change, Sonic Team seems to have gotten spooked by the unknown. Sonic Heroes' brave new conceit is that you're in control of three different characters at the same time. A team (there are four to pick from) consists of a Speed, Power, and Fly character, each with a different set of moves and abilities, and knowing which character should take the lead at any given time is an integral part of the gameplay. Like most Sonic Team games, Heroes gets high marks for replayability as the four teams have different quests, even though the levels and powers are fundamentally the same. Where this system is most successful is in the combat. You quickly learn to identify which combination of attacks will fell your foe the fastest (Sonic's tornado to rip off a shield, Knuckles' Jump Slam to hit the guy while he's down), and switching between characters becomes a matter of instinct thanks to a simple-to-remember swapping system. While there aren't a lot of enemy types, the game has fun with grouping them, and they're always fun to destroy.Strangely enough, Heroes doesn't always seem to trust its own character-swapping gimmick. Most of the time, it's too obvious who's supposed to take the lead as signs are posted that tell you straight-up whether Speed, Power, of Fly should tackle the next situation-and many times, it turns out, it doesn't really matter. Too frequently, the game takes control for you to hurl you through a section, and you're left feeling like you're watching instead of really participating. This can be frustrating on the flipside, too, when you're sure the game is going to automatically land you safely on a narrow tightrope after a blind 200-foot fall...and it doesn't.Though the Xbox version's visuals are a little sharper and the GameCube's controller is a little more suited for the action, the presentation is otherwise nearly identical-fast and colorful, but fairly simple with an overabundance of orbs and boxes, and an underusage of shadows and lighting. Sonic's trademark electric rock soundtrack is in full force (like it or not), and the repeated voice samples telling you what to do delight as frequently as they disgust. Sonic Heroes is a creative stab at reclaiming the essence of hog; if it only had a little more faith in its own clever idea, it probably would have broken the sound barrier.",4,Could've been better,2004/1/7 0:00

It's a total upheaval: a surprising modern reinvention based on old 8-bit blueprints and what Retro Studios did with the Metroid saga on the GameCube. It's awesome, even if you're not old enough to know what an 8-bit system is. Metroid: Zero Mission retells the story of Samus Aran's first visit to the planet Zebes as well as her first encounter with the life-sucking Jell-O molds called Metroids and the jarred evil known as Mother Brain. If you've played the original game, you'll recognize areas, tile sets, names of bosses, and secrets in ceilings, but Nintendo has gone back and seamlessly inserted entire sequences and areas based on the Chozo lore and Space Pirate story arc from Metroid Prime on the GameCube, adding depth and substance to the adventure, and making connections where none really were before-sort of a Star Wars Special Edition-ing of the series but done right. Stick around after the old ""escape from Tourian"" climax for a huge surprise-you won't be disappointed. All of the usual classic Metroid gameplay is here: lots of secret areas to find (and lots of backtracking) with a control scheme and feel that still have yet to be accurately cloned. Some tweaks have been made, all to a greater effect: weapons, functions, and abilities from Super Metroid (Samus's dash move, auto-map, and power bombs) and Metroid Fusion (the ability to grab onto ledges) have been grafted into the gameplay. Plus, techniques like ""bombing yourself up"" to get over walls seems a lot easier to do rather than being a difficult-to-exploit side effect. Some moves are inevitably awkward-angling your shots while equipping your missiles (holding both shoulder buttons while pushing Down and pressing the B button) nearly requires a contortionist-but the designers have otherwise made fine use of the GBA's layout. The presentation is A-list. The graphics are virtually identical to those in the already-excellent Metroid Fusion, capturing the weird, creepy feel of an utterly alien world without compromising color. The sound is classic, too, and Metroid's unforgettable tunes play far more frequently than in Metroid Fusion. But most importantly, it's compelling and fun-a carefully crafted example of what cleverly placed enemies, intelligently placed floating blocks, and a whole mess of secrets can get you. The only real downside is that, despite its size, the game can be blown through pretty quickly. All the new moves and equipment (not to mention a generous helping of save points) make the game feel less challenging than its more open-ended, unforgiving ancestor. Metroid is a classic, but nostalgia doesn't make great games...knowing what to do with it does. Rarely does a game (much less a GBA one) keep the player so constantly surprised.

E Jackson,0,0,"What makes Metroid: Zero Mission so good is the fact it perfectly blends the original NES Metroid with elements of Super Metroid, creating a fascinating blend between two classic games.Many of the abilities from Super Metroid are used in the game, despite the fact it seriously feels like you're playing the original NES Metroid for the majority of your playtime.For those of you who've played the NES and Super NES Metroid games, I like how the game tricks you into thinking you're walking across familiar territory, only to suddenly change a layout in a drastic -and radically new and inventive- way.  It leaves you wanting more, in fact, because you will remember how much you craved the gameplay from the older Metroid games.Some of the theme music -such as in Norfair- is REALLY different compared to the original theme, and in this particular case, hauntingly terrific.However, I don't necessarily think the music in Metroid: Zero Mission is better compared to the original Metroid (or Super Metroid for that matter) but some of the familiar themes will definitely catch your attention because now they've been remade in a strange way giving the game a fresh alternative, and don't be the least bit surprised if you happen to enjoy these updated themes more than their original versions.Some of the boss battles -such as the Kraid fight- don't offer significant changes to their strategy of taking them down and out, but that's alright- this is *still* a great game that does every single thing correctly. I highly recommend this game.Also, the game blends both enemies from the NES and Super NES Metroid classics.  You'll encounter all kinds of familiar foes, but with a new twist.The only reason I'm not giving Metroid: Zero Mission 5 stars is because it just can't compete with the original Metroid or Super Metroid, two groundbreaking games that deserve all the praise they've received the last several years.

A36UKFV79879MD,B00012BSJ4,BX Lounger,0,0,"Metroid: Zero Mission was released in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance and was one of the finest games ever made. It is a remake of the original NES classic, Metroid. For those of you who remembered playing the original all the way until you faced off against Mother Brain, this is the same game with 16-bit Super Metroid"" graphics and extra content that fleshes out the story for a complete adventure that could only come from Nintendo. This game debuted to critical praise and quickly sold like hotcakes. Now, it's time to see why this remake rocks.You control Samus Aran, a bounty hunter tasked with infiltrating planet Zebes and defeating Mother Brain, leader of the Space Pirates who threatens to take over space entirely. You must explore the different areas, collect various weapons and items, take out all the enemies and make your way to Mother Brain. Because it's a big game, Metroid: ZM features save rooms, map rooms, Chozo statues (to restock your missiles, bombs and point you in the right direction) and 3 save slots to record your progress. The weapons and items featured now come from virtually every Metroid game in the series so you will really be packing some serious power compared to the original Metroid game. And the story doesn't end with you defeating Mother Brain and escaping from the exploding planet (a brand new area has been added for you to explore and face off with an old but worthy adversary.)The PROS: Metroid: ZM has been given the upgrade treatment. It looks, plays and feels like Super Metroid but of course with the storyline of the first Metroid game. From the graphics to the weapons to the remixed background music, it fits well and the controls feel just right. Tons of visual and audio clues help you along the way so you know where to go next and the cut scenes, while basic, enhance the story as you play along. And now you don't need passwords to continue your progress; just head to a save room and then come back to the game when you take a break. Overall, it's a great experience.The CONS: There is one small issue that I must address and that is the difficulty. The original Metroid was challenging not only because of the length of the game but because it didn't have save rooms, maps or a reliable save system. You had to figure out which way to go and remember how to get to where you need to go solely by memorization; the remake helps you out in so many ways, it cuts down the challenge. Veteran gamers who grew up playing the classic Metroid will blow through this in a few hours while newcomers may take a little longer. It's not a major flaw by any means but it won't make you sweat when it comes to figuring out where to go and progressing into the game.The bottom line is, Metroid: Zero Mission is a great game and a great addition to the Metroid series. Fans of the classic NES title will enjoy passing their time with this game locked into their GBA while players who don't or haven't played Metroid games will find this is a great re-introduction to the franchise that is known worldwide nowadays. This is how you do a remake and Nintendo couldn't have chosen a better candidate.

While my first playthrough made me think it was just simply okay, my second play made me see all the great gameplay features and fantastic artistic design despite the fact its sequel, Echoes, was basically the same but slightly harder. Of course it helps to play the one that started it all and so we have Zero Mission, a redone version of the original Metroid. Many of its basic gameplay elements will feel familiar and while I prefer the first Prime, Zero Mission was still a fun playthrough.Story: Samus has been tasked to go to the planet of Zebes to destroy Metroids, a strange creature with life-absorbing qualities. But there's more to the planet than on its surface as we get environments, many of them hostile filled with creatures and huge beasts, not to mention 2 big baddies and series staples and we'll get to see some insight into Samus' origins.Graphics: The Metroids on the handhelds (and Super Metroid) never really had outright fantastic graphics. They were merely serviceable and aside from the well done cutscenes, the graphics ingame work within the context of the game but since this was Game Boy Advance, levels have a better amount of detail than before but nothing earth-shattering.Sound/Music: No voice acting but the music is typical of the series, where it has that sort of techno ambience and there's a couple classic themes and even some appearances from other games (look for that eerie intro music from Super Metroid). Sound effects are well done and they're not really flashy but they work well within the game.Gameplay: Exploration is the key as you'll traverse many environments and rooms to get to where you need. Hidden around the stages are powerups to further outfit your character, such as missile expansions and power bombs and the all important energy tanks. The game's simple to use but mastering it, as well as puzzles to get to where you're going or a powerup and there's times where I had to consult a walkthrough since getting somewhere probably wouldn't have come from trial-and-error since there was a couple of spots where I wouldn't have figured it out on my own anyway.The difficulty isn't really that considerable but one boss before the gameplay-changing last stage was agonizing. But enemies shouldn't give you that much of a challenge, what with the energy recharging Chozo statues and a helpful-but-not-distracting hint system that lets you know where to go but doesn't necessarily point at it with a red arrow a la Fusion. It's the kind of game where, on Hard mode, beating it nets you a lot of bragging rights, that's if people don't hear Halo's Legendary settings all the time.While I still consider Prime my favorite of the series, Zero Mission's a worthy playthrough and a chance to see where it all came from.""",4,Revisit an old classic,2008/1/10 0:00
A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B00012BSJ4,"Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...""",30,26,"Metroid: Zero Mission is a Game Boy Advance remake of the game ""Metroid"" for the Nintendo Entertainment System, which started the ""Metroid"" series of games. Many people consider the original game to be the best, in regards to storyline, originality, and etcetera. The new game includes improved graphics, sound, and enemy AI, along with some new missions after the point where the normal game would be completed.The storyline will be familiar to all fans of the series, seeing as it's the same as ""Metroid"". The bounty hunter Samus Aran has been hired to go to the planet Zebes and destroy a race of energy-draining creatures known as Metroids. She must also destroy an evil entity known as Mother Brain. Samus herself was orphaned on this planet by the evil Space Pirates (that's actually the name of their species, at least to the humans) and was rescued and raised by a race known as the Chozo. These highly-advanced creatures gave her the power suit that she wears, so that she may destroy the Space Pirates (as Zebes was also at one time a Chozo colony). Now, using the power of her suit and her natural skills, Samus must destroy this threat to the galaxy.The graphics in this game are very well done, and are a little bit better than the graphics in Metroid Fusion. They are beautiful and immersive. Samus has her original suit, not the bizarre blue punk-style suit she had in Metroid Fusion. Samus gets multiple suits during the course of the game; the basic power suit (which is dark orange), the heat-and-cold resistant Varia suit (which is bulkier and light orange), and the water-pressure resistant Gravity suit (which is like the Varia suit, but purple). There is also a part where Samus loses her power suit and runs around in a jumpsuit, armed only with a pistol (this is a sequence that wasn't in the original game).The sound in the game is not really impressive. Even though it's better than the NES game, it's still basically blips and bleeps. The music isn't bad, and sets the tone more than the sound effects. There is also a very annoying ""low health"" sound, which is a little siren that sounds if your health is less than 10% of its maximum. So basically, if you're really hurt, you just hear ""beepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeep"" over and over again until you get some health, which isn't always easy. The same problem occurs in the ""Legend of Zelda"" games, too. Of course, if it's really annoying, the sound can be turned off, but then you miss out on other sound effects.The gameplay is satisfying. Bosses are often of the ""hit its weak spot with a particular weapon"" variety, though they still look pretty cool. Samus can perform all sorts of maneuvers, such as her morph ball form, in which she can roll around, her freeze missiles, which can freeze enemies and make them into stepping blocks, and her grapple beam, which she can use to swing around on hooks. There is also a good variety of locations, from ancient Chozo ruins to volcanoes.Overall, this game is very, very good. It's a nice way of introducing newer gamers to the beginning of the Metroid series. For old-school gamers, beating the game will get you the original NES Metroid game to play.9/10 (I'm taking one point of for the Low Health Beeps).""",5,Great Remake,2004/3/15 0:00

The game improves on every level over Fusion such as the graphics, sound, and game play (you can play as Zero Suit Samus!) The story isn't as good either, in fact it's hardly there at all. All I knew is that Samus was sent to Zebes to destroy Mother Brain and that's it...yeah some story.All the same weapons and power ups are here that were in Fusion and ZM features a whole new set of bosses and enemies.

But this isn't just any remake: It's packed with lots of extras and new gameplay elements to update it from the original.  Updated graphics, story and extras. If you've played the original Metroid or LOVE the Metroid series you OWE it to yourself to pick this game up!Nice updated graphics will enhance the gameplay and exploration of the game. Nice, sharp, crisp graphics that are to die for! Not only that but now the game includes Full Motion Videos to move the story along!  This game truly takes advantage of the GBA's capabilities.The sound has even been improved and you'll undoubtably love the new upgrade in sound.  Better sound effects and the music is not so different from the original (though I loved the original).The gameplay is more or less the same but this time you've got more help.  The game now has the map in the upper right hand corner of the screen to guide you.  Statues also help lead you to your next objective as well.  Hallways are also changed.  Also, Samus has a Power Grip and Space Jump ability, previously not in the original game.The game also includes a whole new mission! After you defeat the Mother Brain there's actually more to follow.  This will help to tie all the Metroid games (including Prime) together.  Not to mention that as a bonus Nintendo threw in the original Metroid!  So you can actually compare the two.However, the game still has its setbacks.  For one, its still rather short. Longer than Metroid Fusion but not by that much.  Second, the new statues guiding you make it seem like the game is holding your hand too much.  That and the fact that this game is much easier than the original (that can be good or bad).  But don't let those things stop you from picking up this title.

A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B000FRV2UK,Winter,2,2,"There's something innately cheery about the Zelda games I've played:  it's like the creators know that above all, the RPG should be fun.  Even when there are some tough challenges, I've never felt the helpless exasperation that other series sometimes provide, nor have I ever felt like the solution to a problem was deliberately designed to sell the strategy guide.Phantom Hourglass has been around for quite a while now, but I only just recently picked it up and started playing it.  Even though it was partly aimed at showcasing the features of what was then the new Nintendo DS, it's held up well over time.  The look is cartoony enough that older graphics aren't so awful, the colors are bright, and the gimmicky use of the DS' unique features is downright charming.  For example, there are magic candles that you blow out by moving Link in front of them and blowing into the mic.  There are times you use the stylus to make notes on the map, and the game even hints at some good times to do so.  You move Link around on the screen by tapping or dragging the stylus in front of him, and when you do, his flickering fairy companion zips to the point where the stylus is touching the screen, helping you to orient yourself.Even with these new"" features, the original Link series shows through:  you still have the spiraling slash motion (though if you do it too many times in a row he gets dizzy), you still collect gems for money, and you can still find them in clumps of grass and hidden here and there in the game.  Although the look is more of an angled 3D overhead effect than the ""top-down"" Game Boy Zelda games, it's still fairly easy to get the hang of combat and movement.In ""The Phantom Hourglass"", you find that Princess Zelda has been a Pirate Captain for quite a while, only now she's run afoul of The Ghost Ship, a phantom boat that spirited her away, and now Link has to find the clues that will lead him back to her.  You're in an area that's less a world map of continents than it is a chain of islands, divided into four larger pieces that you must explore.  Along the way you have a companion or two, including a rather lazy treasure-hunting ship's captain. You also have some variety in the environments themselves:  for example, navigating a boat from one place to another involves drawing out the route, watching your ship fly along the water, and occasionally having to stop for new discoveries or random obstacles.I really enjoyed The Phantom Hourglass.  It was fun, entertaining, and rather well paced.  It doesn't have huge amounts of character development or story depth, but then again neither does it have a high degree of complexity or require a lot of fast-twitch skills.  If you're looking for an RPG that's easy to get into and hard to put down, Zelda is as good as it gets and The Phantom Hourglass is an excellent entry in the series.""",5,Fun but not Frantic,2010/10/12 0:00
A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0001VGFK2,"Cloud ...""""",3,2,"After the massive success of GTA III and Vice City, Rockstar has come back with a different spin on the story and created a massive playing field. This game to call it huge is just simply understatement.  Not all is well in San Andreas and I'll get to that.Story: Instead of mafia, it's more gang/mafia oriented. CJ skipped town after his brother and mother were gunned down. 5 years later, he returns and decided to step up and take control. He'll be taken to no less than 3 cities and meet interesting characters along the way.Graphics: I don't know what Rockstar was thinking. You have 3 cities, a plethora of options and minigames...all on one disc? Star Ocean 3 and Shadow Hearts 2 both game with 2 discs. Why didn't Rockstar do the same? To show the power of one disc? If so, it succeeds and fails. Graphics looks meh and there's slowdown but still, traversing big area with no load times? Nice.Sound/Music: Like any cities, you have control of 8 radio stations, each playing different music. But they could've picked better songs cause unlike Vice City where any station was worth listening to, here I'm only choosing 2 to 3.  Voice acting's nice with Sam Jackson, James Woods along with some others supplying voices. One thing: there is a LOT of swears and I don't mean S or A words, I'm talking F, n**** and loads others.Gameplay: I don't know why developers think that a difficult and annoying mission is fun"". Some are 3 part missions: one mission I had to drop off a ho, then gun down someone beating on a ho, then go save another one, THEN shoot down 2 cars taking off with one of them. And if you've been to message boards, the mission ""Supply Lines"" is probably one of the worst I've seen. There's 3 things in your way: 1)your plane can't drive worth ****. You got 5 couriers to shoot down, all spaced out, and 3) you have fuel which means by the time you actually do all that, you probably don't even have enough to get back to the roof.As for the rest of it, there's welcome and not-so-welcome changes. Now you got stamina, muscle, fat, sex appeal and skills to worry about. More stamina, more time running without getting tired. Muscle means stronger melee attacks. Fat's just there so that your muscle doesn't go down when running/training but the fat instead. And sex appeal gets you chicks. One mission way later on makes you take a girl on a bunch of dates to get a keycard and it takes awhile. Control's schemes roughly the same with some changes.This is a game that has unbelievable hype behind it and you play it and you notice some things that bug you. For me it was mission tediousness(they're usually fetch quests: go kill him, go pick this up etc) and some graphics issues but nonetheless definately give this a try but prepare to die/fail...a lot.""",5,This is one...massive game,2004/11/1 0:00

I'm writing a walkthrough for this game, so have been playing it pretty much non-stop since its release.First, the gameplay. If you've been living in a cave and haven't heard of this game, it is definitely MATURE. The other two GTA3 games were mildly mature. This one is full blown mature. There is more swearing in 5 minutes of the game than in most full length R-rated movies. You are beating up people with baseball bats, having drive-by gang shootings, and more. This isn't a game for kids.That being said, there is a lot here to entertain adults who are into gang life and rap music. The graphics are really quite amazing, and the maps are HUGE. You can drive all over intricately detailed streets, hopping in and out of whatever cars you see. There are different areas of town, each with its own look and feel.The music immerses you in this world which is both bad and good. If you love the rap / hiphop music, you're all set. But unlike the other games that gave you a wide selection of music to choose from, in San Andreas you're pretty stuck with that one genre. I suppose there is one country station, plus the traditional (and fun) talk station too.Gameplay is typical GTA style. You go on missions. In your missions you shoot the bad guys and go on object-finding hunts. There are tags to spray paint, people to talk to and deeds to do. A lot of blood is spilled along the way.An addition to San Andreas is the customization of your character. You're a black male adult, and can go into barber shops to change your hairstyle at whim. You can also hop into a tattoo shop to add tats to various parts of your body. As you eat and run, you can get muscular, slim, fat or so on. If you eat too much and get fat, it slows you down. If you don't eat enough, you end up weak. Balance is key here.The game is flying out of stores at an incredible rate, and the pre-orders for it were collossal. Loyal fans will not be disappointed - the game really amps up every aspect. Those who want to complain about the violence and language will find plenty to be upset about - but remember, this game is for adults only. It clearly says mature on the box. So if an adult chooses to play this game and have fun with it - well, that's their decision to make!",5,Amazingly good game - but pay attention to the MATURE rating,2004/10/29 0:00

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B0001VGFK2,S. Rhodes,12,11,"Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is THE PS2 game to get this holiday season.  Anyone who thinks this is simply a rehash of Vice City is wrong.  This game goes above and beyond any GTA game before it and is arguably the best in the series!This particular Grand Theft Auto takes place in not just one but FOUR different cities. It also takes place in 1992. You play as Carl Johnson (better known as CJ"") who has returned to his hood in Los Santos.  You're soon caught in the middle of a gang war and in all essence have to leave Los Santos.  Where as GTA3 had a tendency to remind us of movies like ""The Godfather"" and ""The Untouchables"" this game is more of a reminder of ""Menace II Society"" and ""Boyz N the Hood"".The game plays out very nicely.  As in the previous GTA games you go around performing missions for various people.  Each mission gives you a reward of some sort.  The more missions you complete the more of the game you'll get to explore.  There are set missions you must do to complete the story (and win the gang war) but several are optional.Alongside the gameplay it more takes a spin on the GTA games.  For example, in this one, rather than collecting 100 hidden packages you have to ""tag"" certain graffiti marks that mark your territory.As with other GTA games you've got several different weapons and vehicles of your choice.  Your arsenal is nearly endless. Almost any weapon you can think of is here.  You can also steal cars (go figure) and cruise the city if you want.  The nice thing about the GTA series is there's really no ""end"".  You can ""beat"" the game but there's always something more you can do.  It's also open-ended.  Do you really want to continue missions or do you just want to run around on a killing spree?  Your choice.This particular GTA also lets you fly planes.  In Vice City you could fly planes but not like in this.  You can actually go to the airport and steal one (and on some missions you have to use one).  Also, unlike in other GTA games, your character can actually swim.Another twist San Andreas adds to GTA is how much more character building goes into it.  You COULD have a buffed up character if you work out your muscles enough.  You can control what Carl looks like.  Do you want him to have an afro? Are you willing to pay to cut that afro?  What kind of clothes do you want him to wear?  That's not all, you can actually date in this one and the game lets you know how you're progressing in the relationship. San Andreas really is bigger.The game also keeps track of your criminal record as did past GTA games.  Each time you commit a felony you'll get a ""star"" that adds to your ""wanted level"".  Your wanted level goes up to six but you've got to be a real major bad ass to do that.  Usually by four it stops for a while.  The higher your wanted level the more umm... wanted you are. However, the police actually DO bust other criminals besides you.  It isn't uncommon to see them chasing around another crook.Graphically it isn't that far ahead of Vice City.  It runs smoothly and looks less clunky (not quite as many square faces) and runs fast.  There are still a couple of problems with the loading times but they're not quite as long as the past GTA games.Music wise the game has spectacular voice overs.  No game EVER has had this good of voice acting.  It's more convincing than most other games out there.  The music can either be good or bad, depending on what you're into.  You'll hear a lot of early 90's classics.  A lot of the music is Hip-Hop and R&B; but there's a little bit of something for everybody.  The talk shows are hilarious as well.Now for the cons.  Are there cons for this game? Sadly yes there are.  Its great that the gameplay has remained unchanged but the problem isn't there.  The problem is some missions are downright frustrating.  The piloting controls for flying a plane also feel a bit clunky at times.Then of course there's what parents fear: The violence and explicit language.  If you're a smart parent you'll keep this game far away from your kids who probably don't understand the difference between reality and fantasy yet.  The game rightly deserves the ""M"" rating.  As for the language, while it is bad keep in mind the game is rated ""M"" so once again, keep it away from your children who may be too young.Overall, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a grand game.  By far one of the best games the PS2 and probably even the best game in the GTA series so far.  It's much bigger and out-going than any other GTA game yet.  If you're in the mature audience this game is probably going to hold you over for a while.  It'll take well over 70 hours to complete but every hour spent on this game I guarantee you is worth it.""",5,Only one word: WOW (Keep out of reach of Children),2004/11/9 0:00
A2582KMXLK2P06,B0002RQ3ES,B. E Jackson,1,0,"Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is a drastically different game compared to the first two. Now the setting takes place outside in the deep forest-filled jungle, the underwater caves and eventually the mountaintops. Instead of sneaking behind enemies and knocking them out, you can simply stand faraway and shoot them with one of your guns. Minor disappointment there because it unintentionally makes MGS3 more like a regular war game.  However it's still incredibly important to infiltrate areas and go undetected by guards- there's just significantly less emphasis on this trademark aspect compared to the previous two games. Interestingly, I can't recall seeing any security cameras anywhere, a constant nemesis in the very first Metal Gear Solid for the PS1.The bosses are all pretty basic and feel ordinary and uncreative. The strategies required to take them out mostly focuses on standing back and shooting them whenever the moment/timing is right. You can simply use your handgun weapon to take them out as well. Not as strategic as previous MGS games. The boss covered in hornets in the cave/water area and the one where you have to avoid the flames shooting down the hallways are the more memorable ones, however. A lot of people like the old man sniper boss battle where Snake has to avoid being detected and sneak through quite a bit of bushes and trees to find and eliminate him, but it's sometimes confusing finding your way through the paths in the forest which results in cheap shots out of nowhere.However the game has one thing going right for it, and it's an *extraordinary* thing- the storyline. It's so elabrate, well-constructed and gripping on an emotional level involving certain characters (some of which return such as Ocelot) that it would be a foolish decision to skip over them. The characters of Eva- the most attractive woman to EVER appear in a video game, and the Boss- a powerful female soldier, are the best two. Without a DOUBT the best two characters in the game, no question. Ocelot is pretty awesome too- he often shows off by spinning his guns around like a cowboy, and even meows like a cat which is hilarious. The storyline is about stopping a Russian nuclear strike against the United States and capturing important scientists and information to prevent these plans from actually occurring. It's really good and not at all generic.The one area where stealth is pretty important is when you have to climb the mountaintops where the helicopter is flying by. This is later on in the game and it's pretty darn tricky making your way through here. The portions where you have to disguise yourself as a scientist so the guards don't detect you're Snake is pretty boring however, not to mention the facilities aren't enticing to admire. Another character made of electricity named Volgin is pretty fun, but his intimidating features aren't so threatening when it's finally time to battle him. In fact he's one of the easiest fights in the game once you can figure out what to do.Snake has to eat food such as snakes to survive in the jungle, and even has to heal himself with his own carrying medical kit so to speak. An interesting realistic idea. Well, then again, how realistic can it actually *be* to heal yourself if you're in such bad shape, really? Especially when you're in such bad shape as Snake in a couple scenes and yet he prevails regardless. Oh and Snake sure takes a butt whippin' in this game! Quite often in fact, hehe. It's quite shocking how hopeless Snake is on a few occasions, and plus he gets somewhat emotional in a few segments which is equally surprising.Overall, expect a LOT of cutscenes (moreso than the first two MGS games) but also expect a story almost on par with the first two as well. The best cutscene is the one featuring the Boss at the end of the game. I'm not going to spoil it- I'll let your emotions dictate how unbelievably touching it is. Overall, great game. There just needs to be more stealth-style missions that involve less gun shooting segments and more sneaking up and eliminating enemies with Snake's bare hands. That would have officially been the icing on an already really good cake.",4,watch out for that all-out war,2013/8/18 0:00

The graphics and gameplay were spot-on, while it provided a lot of interesting characters and furthering the mythology of Metal Gear. There was just one problem: you couldn't figure it out. Wave after wave of cutscene and plot twists left you wondering what the hell? Over the course of the game, you find out a group called the Patriots are secretly controlling America, only thing is they've been dead for a century. In the words of Snake: what the hell?"" In comes 3, which actually goes back when Metal Gear was first being developed.Story: You are Naked Snake(not literally, his code name), a CIA agent sent to rescue a nuclear scientist named Sokolov from a group called the Cobras who are using Sokolov to build a device capable of launching nuclear weapons. The Cobras are basically like 1's Foxhound or 2's Dead Cell. Over the course of the game, you find out more about Naked Snake's old mentor the Boss as well as the origin of Metal Gear.Graphics: Metal Gear Solid 2 looked very shape-y with squares and it looked flat while this is more detailed. The jungle looks quite detailed and there's a lot to see despite the fact it's only branch and trees. The character models look better too and emote more.Sound/Music: David Hayter returns as Snake and he's more expressive and human then the soldier badass Solid Snake. The rest are pretty good, especially the Boss, played by Lori ""Diane Simmons on Family Guy"" Alan. The Cobras, especially Fear and Pain have those stereotypical ""evil"" voices but they're not bad. The music has a nice epic score done by semi well-known composer Harry Gregson Williams of Armageddon fame. Also has a James Bond feel to it.Gameplay: A bit of changes which makes it feel different.

Now you use the Camoflage system where you dress up according to the surroundings. More higher the %, better you won't be seen.You get the option in fighting of CQC(Close Quarter Combat) where you have more options when you grab an enemy: either throw him, slit his throat, interrogate him or use him as a shield. If you're like me, you just pick them off from far away and not worrying about them finding you. Your CODEC hasn't been invented yet either so you only have your radio.One thing that has been reduced but not by much is the frequency of cutscenes and CODEC transmissions and general weirdness of that plot. There's no Colonel acting virus-like on here or double crossers and thankfully, no 10 minute Codec screens everytime you're in a new area. You can press R1 now and then during cutscenes for some neat moments like Snake staring at a woman's chest or a mysterious ghost like figure to helpful hints. It's not as overtly complicated as MGS2 or as cool as one but it's the first time I've beaten the game twice within the span of a few days so I find it strangely addicting.Overall, it's another great entry in the series that has been rumored to be the last although I think they announced a 4. Let's hope it takes place after MGS2 so they can explain what the hell happened.""",5,"Much better than 2, not as good as 1",2004/11/25 0:00

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B0002RQ3ES,S. Rhodes,17,15,"Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is a wonder to behold.  It improves among its predecessor greatly but unfortunately, due to the essence of time, doesn't make as big of an impact on the gaming world.  An innovative storyline, and great systems but as with MGS2 it puts far too much emphasis on storyline.Metal Gear Solid 3 is a different sort of game.  It takes place in the 1960's rather than in the millenium like the previous games.  Snake is sent into the harsh depths of a Cuban jungle to rescue a Russian weapons specialists who has created a weapon so powerful it could disrupt the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.  He has to stop this weapon before it falls in the hands of Colonial Volgin, Snake's nemesis in this title.  Anyone who has played previous games in the series knows that there's so much more to it than this. The game is once again full of plot twists that will ultimately blow your mind unlike any other.As with the previous games, the story is told in cutscenes that ultimately deterierate from the gameplay itself.  Most of the cutscenes are fascinating and well thought out but others seem to be there just to be there.  There will be plenty of times when you'll wish some cutscenes would get to the point, especially since the game takes a while to jump into the story and the cutscenes really stack up in the beginning.Gameplay is more influenced and open ended in MGS3.  This is mostly because you're in a more open setting than the corriders of the previous two games.  Rather than being on a base you're in a jungle.  This installment also doesn't have a radar to guide you.However, the game does have new innovations.  For example, even though you don't have a radar, remaining undetected is no harder than it was in the previous game.  There's a percentile to tell you how close you are to be detected and how exposed you are.  In addition, the game also presents different camoflouge outfits that Snake can outfit himself in when in different enviroments.  These outfits can make it so that blending in with the terrain makes the difference between being discovered and not.Another new addition is the stamina"" guage and the ability to eat food.  Unlike the past two games in the series, there are no rations scattered around.  You actually have to eat animals in order to survive.  But food doesn't recover your health.  The stamina gauge does.  Whenever your low on health the stamina guage slowly depletes to refill your life guage.  The only way to refill your stamina gauge is to eat animals.  When your stamina gets too low Snake starts to feel the effects such as he can't aim his gun very well (he'll be too shaky) and some animals even give Snake a stomachache.  This is really fun to experiment with (and some of Snake's reactions to the food are funny) but the food system isn't anything to jump about.  It isn't all that innovative.The game's boss battles are perhaps the most fun in the game. The MGS series is famous for having some pretty innovative and epic boss battles.  This one is no exception.  Most boss battles encourage you to experiment with what Snake can do.  This in itself is a fun experience. If you're ever stuck in a boss battle and don't know what to do you can just as easily call your supporters on the codec, mainly Major Zero, who'll give you some handy advice.There's one mini-game extra that MGS3 presents.  The monkey capturing game, which is similar to VR training in helping you get used to the game.  In each level of this mini-game Snake is to go around and catch monkeys.  He's either supposed to knock them out with a stun grenade or shoot them with a special gun.  Once the monkey is knocked out you capture him.  As you get further and further in this mini-game the levels get harder and harder and you have to capture more and more monkeys.The game also repeats many of the gameplay elements found in MGS2.  You can still hold up guards and shoot in first person.  You can also still use the cardboard box to sneak around.  So when you actually get to play the game it's rather fun. There's a bit more things to do as well.  You can use the enviroment to your advantage.  You could shoot a bees nest and have the bees pester your enemies.  You can also pick up poisonous snakes and throw them at your enemies.  The possiblities of torturing your enemies are endless.Replay wise the game is great.  After you beat the game once you get items to start with.  There's also the fact that the game presents many difficulty levels which add to the replay value.  It's also great to play through the game again and fill in plotholes you might've missed.  Also, it's remarkable how much gameplay there really is once you start skipping the cutscenes.However, the game has drawbacks.  As I mentioned, the game becomes tedious in its cutscenes.  The story is intriguing and much better than MGS2 but sometimes you'll wish it would pace faster.  The radio talks (better known as codec conversations) are also tedious at times.  Most cutscenes aren't boring and being able to zoom in on them isn't so bad either.  They're lavish and look incredible and are filled with incredible emotion.  The cutscenes are too close together and take a lot from the gameplay.  Some are just downright meaningless and drag on for far too long.The game also presents too little of a challenge.  Enemy AI is improved but not much better than MGS2.  Most enemies don't do much damage to you, even on the hard mode setting you won't take so much damage.Graphically, MGS3 is great. The jungle is really vibrant and colorful and character models are excellent.  It's visually stunning but doesn't make as big of an impact as earlier games did since there's nothing visually new about these graphics.  Many character models have even been repeated from MGS2.  The frame rate also has a tendency to slow down due to the vibrant colors of the jungle.  Overall though, the graphics are almost no different than they were in MGS2.The sound in this game is to die for! The Snake Eater theme is perhaps the best soundtrack in the entire game.  The music was done by Harry Gregson-Williams, who also did the soundtrack for MGS2 and many Hollywood films.  Voice acting is done great but sometimes feels a bit overdone. I'm happy David Hayter has reprised his role.  He makes a great voice for Snake.  Other voices sometimes don't fit with the character.  Major Zero feels a bit overdone and his voice doesn't even match up with who his character really is. But the voice acting is splendid and among the best in the video-gaming industry.It should take you at least 15 hours to beat the game the first time, assuming you don't skip the cutscenes. It'll keep you busy for the better half of the day.  This is one incredible game that won't soon be forgotten.The Good:+Impressive graphics+Innovative gameplay+A bit more realistic+Good replay value+Incredible storyline+Amusing characters+Good voice acting and musicThe Bad-There are tons of cutscenes that take away from the gameplay.-Many cutscenes are useless-The game doesn't present a major challenge-There's way too much emphasis on plot and not on gameplay""",4,Snake Eater slowly eats away at your time.,2004/11/17 0:00
AQMWZIH22R6LE,B0002RQ3ES,"TwistaG Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore""""",4,3,"Okay, so in retrospect, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty was severely lacking in the story department, with its scarcity of Solid Snake, abundance of whiney Raiden, and speeches on the evils of nuclear war--not to mention a final resolution that didn't make much sense. Forget all that. Snake Eater revives the spirit of the first Solid, with an intriguing scenario, intense action, and a long adventure that stays riveting almost every step of the way--all wrapped in high-gloss cinematic cut-scenes and voice-overs that could have come from any A-action film. The game's long, but not overly so (save a few boss battles that go a few rounds too many), and it brilliantly combines the wide outdoors with confining interiors. The game's Cold War 1960s setting puts Snake right at cloak-and-dagger home. His mission is to infiltrate Soviet territory and rescue a nuclear scientist before he can create a weapon for a renegade group of Russian soldiers called the Cobra Unit. Complicating matters is Snake's former mentor, The Boss, who has defected to the Russians for personal reasons. The Solid titles dish out some intriguing boss characters, and Snake Eater features a pack of self-loathing, suicidal psychos condemned by their own murderous skills. Defeating them requires brains (The Sorrow), brawn (The Fear), or a combination of both (The End). Although it's set an era long gone, there's an effective arsenal of weapons and gadgets to collect. Dealing in stealth, there's a camouflage system where the uniform, face paint, and stance determines how well you blend into an environment, but to keep his stamina high, Snake must gather his own food, heal serious wounds, set fractures, and even cure diseases. It adds excellent depth to the game and makes the main character that much more human. Close-quarter combat is emphasized this time, as Snake can take on enemies in an up close and personal fashion by using his knife and pistol combination to extract information, create a human shield, or silently dispose of his prey. The solid controls keep the multiple functions literate and easy to remember. However, one of the few hitches is trying to fire your pistol while you use an enemy as a human shield. Somehow, you must keep your thumb on the [C] button and tap [SQ], which is quite a feat to accomplish. The game's lack of a custom-controller configuration doesn't help, either. The aesthetics pack a huge punch. The steaming jungles are fittingly brought to life, albeit with a tad of slowdown and other minor distractions for the otherwise-steady frame rate. The audio is first-rate, with the usual excellent voice casting, poignant sound effects, and rousing music score--some of the best the industry has to offer. Games of this high caliber don't come around often, but they're certainly appreciated when they do. Rumors abound that this is the last Metal Gear Solid game. If this is the case, Snake Eater is a superb swan song...and one of the best games of the year.",5,Third times a charm,2004/12/8 0:00

A game comes out that is on everyone's top 10 list, it's practically raved about and you try it and you sit there going so when's the awesomeness going to kick in?"". God of War to me is pretty much the only game I'm interested in right now(besides Jade Empire and Conker but I don't have an Xbox) so I tried it out and it's not the greatest game ever, but it's still fun for what it is.Story: Kratos, this pale, scar-riddled man takes a plunge off Mount Olympus as he can't deal with his inner demons any more. The narrator decides to show you what led him to do this. 3 weeks earlier, Kratos was giving a mission: defeat the god Ares and the troubles and nightmares of Kratos past will be relieved.Graphics: It's funny when people say it looks like an Xbox title cause while I don't find a lot of Xbox games to get excited over, their graphical capabilities are quite a force. God of War has nice pretty polished graphics. It also nicely details the gruesome deaths you're likely to unleash on your enemies.Sound/Music: The soundtrack is sweet. Big epic scores worthy of a Hollywood score. The voice acting is alright, whoever did Kratos does his part well but it's not a huge standout that made me laugh and emphasize with him like Prince of Persia.Gameplay: To me, it's pretty much a Devil May Cry style engine but with different attacks and spells and graphics set to a greek mythology view rather than a dark gothic look. You got 2 main attacks: medium and strong which you'll be pretty much going back and forth throughout the game. When you grab you have 3 options: square stabs the enemy and throws him around the room and possibly hitting the others; triangle is the more gruesome as Kratos grabs his enemy's waist and rips the guy in 2 while circle just throws him to the ground and repeatedly stabs him. You get new attacks as you upgrade DMC style like uppercuts and rush attacks.You also get magic spells like Zeus's lightning or the ability to hold Medusa's head and shine it on enemies turning them to stone than shattering them. Boss fights are quite a thing to see...the little you see of them anyway. Also extremely cool is that certain enemies have different death options. Some enemies only have the aforementioned button ones but some are unique and equally gruesome. The minotaur death is where you have to press O repeatedly, if you get it, you stab him right through the mouth. You can rip the wings off these bat guys or rip the arm off this other one and beat him to death. This is definately not one for the kiddies.It's not revolutionary as a game title and it's certainly not the best thing in gaming but still if you're looking for something, can't go wrong with this.""",4,"This isn't the 2nd coming people, but it's still worth a try",2005/4/13 0:00
A2GBBDNZLYC4A9,B0002XL3BA,"Jeff Johnson Jeff Johnson""""",0,0,"Oh God or War, what can I say that hasn't already been said. This is probably one of the best games of its console generation. This is a bloody, mature beat-em up that is disguised as an adventure game. There are really clever puzzles mixed in, a great story, fluid and fun combat, and even upgradable attacks.First let's start with the story. Set in ancient Greece in a world full of Greek mythology, you play as Kratos, a great general that sold his soul to win a battle and as the pawn of the god Aries, Kratos inadvertently kills his wife and child. Because of this, Kratos is a pawn to Aries no more and the entire game is your quest to slay the giant god of war Aries. The story is told in excellently stylized cut scenes that give you little bits of information about what's happening and how you came to get to where you are. The story alone is very solid and logical.Now let's talk about the gameplay, which is amazing, fun, fluid and diverse. Like I mentioned, this is a beat-em up, so you can actually spam one button... but because of the fantastic enemy diversity you need to change your tactics to defeat each enemy. To top that off, when some of the larger enemies are weak, you can execute specific death finishing moves to them that require you to push certain buttons quickly or swirl one of the control sticks. They are a true test of your skill. On top of your standard weapon comes four magic spells that you need to find throughout the game. A Poseidon's rage that will damage everything around you, a Medusa's gaze that will turn enemies to stone, a Zeus's lightning volt that allows you to throw lightning at distant enemies and the last one I won't spoil. Then on top of that you can execute a temporary powerup to help you mow down enemies. The left analog stick controls you and the right analog stick allows you to dodge or move quickly in a brief burst of speed with a roll. There are two attack buttons a jump button (that turns into a double jump), a block, a shoulder charge, a magic button and the D-pad selects the spell. These are just the combat options. Then there are swimming controls that you obtain a few hours into the game, and even fighting and swinging mechanics for when you're hanging from ropes. This game has a lot of depth.The enemies are diverse and you might kill a million foes on your way to meet Aries, but you will never be bored from it. Everything from standard soldiers to Minotaur, Cyclopes, archers, Gorgons (Medusas), hydras, skeletons and so on. Everything is different and looks awesome. There are different attack patterns and ways you need to deal with them. The bosses are gigantic, you really feel good when you've tackled one of them, simply because boss battles are epic and might take you ten minutes to take one down without dying. Ten minutes of action and not hiding, in fact this game has no emphasis on hiding or stealth. You are Kratos and you are up to the challenge of anything. That's something the game really achieves, you feel powerful, without feeling overpowered.Between the fighting, there are clever puzzles. Excellent puzzles that keep you playing even if some of them are daunting. The game always has something to break up the fighting that you will enjoy completing. The puzzles are sometimes relaxing, no pressure puzzles to timed, death puzzles. Not everything is wildly heart pumping, some things are sedate and the music will even change to reflect that.Next comes the sound design. The sound is awesome and the music is incredible for keeping the pace of the game and getting your blood pumping. The music sounds empowering to you as a player. Any orchestra would love to play this music and it becomes engraved in your head as one of the best themes in history, not just gaming history.Last are the graphics, which stand out as a selling point. Everything is beautiful from standard enemies to wide vistas. Plus, to top that off, there are contrasting visuals, such as you a man standing inside of this gigantic fortress that has no end... that is ontop of a giant's back crawling in a desert. There is a certain awe that you will feel when you run through a city that in the horizon has a giant Aries fighting an entire army in the background. Your jaw will drop in amazement at some things you will see.In conclusion, this is an awesome game that every action fan should play through to the end. There are also some awesome unlockables and reasons to play again and again. There are different things to find, other nooks to explore. God or War is an amazing game that is a true epic classic. Kudos to everyone who made it.",5,Incredible action game with a perfect blend of combat and clever puzzles,2012/4/11 0:00

You are a beefy gladiator style warrior, whipping chains around your head. You don't just take on one bad guy at a time.

Lots of heavy full orchestra style of music that many gamers play on their MP3 players even when they're not enjoying the game. You really get drawn into the battles.The visuals were great for the PS2, but I do have to admit in current times that they seem very dark and blocky. The blockiness is fine, I am still happy playing Adventure with its duck-dragons. The darkness is another issue, though. I get frustrated when I can't see the enemies on the screen to slay.They do a great job with smooth loading screens and integrated boss battles. You could easily keep playing and playing this for days on end, as long as someone was ferrying you in food and water.If you're looking for a quiet puzzle game, this probably isn't for you. But if you're a mature gamer, OK with seeing violence, looking for some hard core hack and slash with a real feeling of being in the action, then I definitely recommend this game.

God of War may appear to be a button mashing beat 'em up at first glance, but look deeper and you'll find one of the most richly produced and rewarding games made in the past decade.  You play as spartan warrior Kratos, and you're on a mission of revenge against Ares, the God of war.

The game is easy enough to pick up and play and the combo systems and moves are incredibly done.

From here the action builds, but despite the massive amounts of gore, the horrifyingly cruel ways you can kill your opponents, and the terrible torments you inflict upon all, the substance of God of War is just plain satisfying.What saves God of War from being a cheapened button-masher is its scope and its depth:  you have clear goals, just the right amount of cinematic tie-ins, and puzzles that, while not incredibly hard, are also rather satisfying to complete.

In this review I'll tell you pretty much everything you need/want to know about it.First off, the Nintendo DS has two screens, one on the top half of the system, the other on the lower half, so it's like a flip phone in other words, with two screens. The design is slightly bulky, but it's the best someone could do with it's kind of idea. When you look straight at the back of the front screen it's flat and has two slopes where the speakers are. At the bottom of it is the word Nintendo. When you open it, there is a screen in the middle at the top with speakers at the side, and below the top screen is another screen, with buttons to the left and right. On the left is the D-Pad"" and the power button. The D-Pad is all one button. On the right is the select and start button, along with the Y,X,A, and B buttons. They work well, but they are extremely small. If you continue looking down the DS, you will see a blank space. It is for a GBA game if you want one in there. To the right is a Headset and a Headphone jack, to the left is volume control. On the back of the DS at the top is where you insert the DS game. To its left is where the stylus goes. The shoulder buttons are on the top and left right corners of the DS. The handheld is pretty small when you open up, it's really actually thin, top and bottom, it's just that when one is on the other it is sort of big.Anyways, about the DS, the graphical capabilities are not on par with the PSP in any way, so if your all about graphics, get a PSP, but graphics aren't THAT important. The overall sound quality is fine, the controls are easy enough, ( but unlike other Nintendo handhelds, this one has four buttons where your thumb hangs over. Instead of just A and B buttons, there is also X and Y.The Game Selection: Not too great.

I have to admit; I wasn't expecting very much from this new handheld, at first, in the way of true 3-D gaming on a handheld. Yet, after playing games such as Super Mario 64 as well as the demo for Metroid Prime Hunters(called First Hunt), I'm convinced this system is one to be reckoned with.  I like the fact that it gives portable gaming a more grownup look and approach. Indeed, it represents a rather large leap in portable gaming but a much needed one. Judging from the launch releases as well as the ones to come in the new year, Nintendo- definitely- has third-party support gamewise. I look forward to seeing what innovation the developers come up with concerning the DS' dual screens. I can think of a whole list of things that they can do with them, myself. At any rate, it 'll be interesting to see how things go for this system. I have high hopes for it, personally. There's alot to like about it. Look here, later on, for a more in-depth review on this system as times goes by. Let me spend a lil time with my system first and I'll let you know what I think. For now, my response is very favorable.The fact that it's in a clamshell design is a plus to me. Like my SP, it saves the screen from scratches and whatnot.If I had any gripes, whatsoever, about the DS....it'd be the size of the system. It's too big to fit in a pocket like the Gameboy Advance SP. But, that's a gripe I can overlook. I mean, who knows, Nintendo might come out with a smaller design for the DS, just like they did with the SP.All in all, the Nintendo DS reminds me of a handheld Nintendo 64 but smaller and significantly better.

Let me just give a few quick first impressions.1. The thing is BIG!  If you are old enough to remember the first-generation clamshell electronic organizers, the DS looks just like one of them.  It feels big even in my big, adult hands.  I was originally thinking of buying another one for my 10-year-old nephew, but now I'm not sure he'll like it.  The DS was definitely designed for the adult gamer.  It's also thick.  Also, the lid doesn't flush with the bottom unit, so it looks weird when closed.  I definitely miss the better styling on the GBA SP.  The DS looks and feels cheap.  (Like the GBA SP, this is manufactured in China.)2. The two LCD screens are identical in size (3 each), the only difference being the bottom screen is touch-sensitive.  The screens are bright and in full colors and look better than the screen on the GBA SP.  I wish they were bigger, though; at this size, screen real estate is still too tight.  You can input on the bottom screen by using either the stylus (two are included in the package), or the plastic thumb pad on the wrist strap.  Backlighting can be turned off if desired.3. The stereo speakers are awesome.  Well, this is when compared to past Game Boy speakers.  This time around they are in stereo and that makes a big difference in the gaming experience.  The DS also has a built-in microphone, and you can hook up regular earphones via the regular 1/8"" jack on the front to get even better audio.4. Obviously at this point we don't have many games to use for testing the DS.  But judging from screenshots of some of the planned DS-only games, if done correctly, the dual-screen setup can be advantageous.  For one thing, using a secondary screen relieves the main screen of too much clutter.  In a driving game, for example, stats and course map can be displayed at the bottom.5. The 4-way pad and the 4 control buttons (yes, 4 of them, labeled A, B, X, Y) feel shallow, but easier on the thumbs than the GBA SP buttons.  I wish the DS buttons would give more feedback.  The L and R triggers feel rather loose.  I'm rather disappointed in the overall build quality of the DS.6. But the demo game shows off the processing power of the DS, but is otherwise quite boring -- not a real game by any measure.  The DS apparently has lots of processing power, and playing Nintendo handheld games will no longer by kiddie stuff.  We are talking a serious game console here, capable of 3D gaming.  I haven't bothered looking into the processing specs, but the demo game is pure 3D and features smooth graphics.  Hopefully, producing great, engaging games is what Nintendo will continue to be best at.All in all, the Nintendo DS is a nice gaming platform that looks promising, assuming the third-party deveopers will properly take advantage of the dual-screen and wireless features.  I wish the DS were physically smaller and more refined, but I look forward to playing full-version DS games soon.""",4,First impressions - advanced but big,2004/11/26 0:00

Here are our feelings after two years of playing this unit pretty much daily.The sequel for the GameBoy Advance, the Nintendo DS features two screens of gameplay, and a folding clamshell design to protect those screens from harm.The top screen is a traditional, classic screen. The bottom screen is a PDA-style touch screen that works with a stylus (plastic pen). The D-pad is on the left of the lower screen, the directionals on the right. You get stereo sound, a microphone, and best of all, built in wireless connections!That means that you can play games with up to 15 other people in your area without any cables at all. Everyone on your bus could chat or challenge each other. Study hall and waiting in line becomes an adventure. There's a built in clock and calendar, and you can even choose your name and favorite color.There are now an amazing collection of games available for the DS. I love the Brain Age type games, where you can improve your memory and alertness with fun daily practice games. I also like the Animal Crossing and Zoo Tycoon style games where you care for animals and build up worlds. There are even great RPGs like Trace Memory that let you get involved in long term gameplay.The DS lets you play not only the new games (on a very thin card which you want to take some care in handling) but also the old style cartridges as well. So you can bring your entire game library from your previous systems over to this new game! That gives you easily hundreds of games, many being sold at bargain-basement prices, to play on your new system - with the nice new controls and back-lit screens.The wireless built in PictoChat is SUPER fun. We have two DSs in our household and every time people come over, we get them playing with PictoChat. You immediately launch into games of pictionary, guess-the-shape, silly notes, and much more. You practically don't need a game, if you have someone fun to talk to!We were initially concerned with the durability of the touch screen. They do sell plastic protectors for the screens which I *highly* recommend. If you wear out that touch screen with all the games, you'll be pretty upset as it stops responding quickly in games. With those screens in place, we haven't had any issues at all. We don't hammer the touch screens, but we aren't super gentle with them either. After two years, they still respond as quickly as when we first got them.We do own two PSPs as well. Yes, the graphics on the PSP are MUCH better.  I'm not saying this is bad, it's just something to recognize as a fact of life. It's *meant* to be a simpler game system. It's like comparing the Wii against the PlayStation 3. But just like with the Wii and PSP, it's an entirely different situation. Sure, the PSP gives movies and high quality graphics. However, the DS touch screen and microphone provide really fun gameplay even if the graphics are sometimes pixelly. Does Mario really need pores in his face to be fun? I think not!Rating: 5/5",5,After Two Years - Still Amazingly Fun,2006/12/16 0:00

Yet, with all the hype, there is a lot more than really meets the eye. Nintendo has already ruled the handheld video game category with the triumph and longevity of the different Game Boy's: Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Color, and the original Gamr Boy dating back to the 1980's. However, since Sony has developed a upcoming handheld Playstation video game system that will hit the shelves, a new battle has begun. For Nintendo, they truly have captured the gaming wars again.The Nintendo DS system, is a hanheld gaming system that features a dual screen, and different kinds of games available right now. The controls are very simple for Game Boy Advance gamers, which you can actually play on this system as well as the DS games including the surpringly outrageous revised version of Super Mario 64, Super Mario 64 DS. The game system focuses in on the feel of a stylus pointer pen as a use for touch screen technology, which is found on Pocket PC's, and handheld organizers. The control of the DS system takes a lot of time to get used to, especially for so many who are masters of the analog conrollers, which can be very frustrating on games like Super Mario 64 DS, and The Urbs, a spin-off game of The Syms that is very popular, but the gameplay is just amazing with the graphics and the masterful sound.All in all, with so many desperate for the Nintendo DS system right now, it is just hard to get your hands on one. Yet, it is well worth it for some, but for others that may take a long time. For some, they'll just feel the wait is so long that they might consider the Game Boy Advance SP as a consilation supplement instead. Still, Nintendo's DS is a great system for all to try.Gameplay: BSound: BControl: C+Backwards Compatability with Game Boy Advance: A-Overall: B+",4,Portable 2 In 1,2005/1/7 0:00
A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00064MUIA,S. Rhodes,12,10,"From a certain standpoint, this is quite a revolution in gaming.  The Nintendo DS is without doubt one of the most amazing things Nintendo has ever presented to the world.  The Nintendo DS is a handheld powerhouse.To begin, this is not just another Gameboy system.  This is a system capable of handling 3D graphics and smooth frame rate.  It has wireless capabilities, and a touch screen.Let's start off with the gold.  What makes the DS a treasure.  The DS supports 64-Bit graphics, making it possible to present games in full 3D.  Not only that but the picture is clear and crisp.  If you have a Nintendo 64 you'll also note that the DS presents games looking a bit more lavish (look at Super Mario 64 DS for instance).The touch screen is a new addition to gaming, and the DS makes good use of it.  Enjoying the DS's touch screen is just one of the biggest joys of it.  Each DS comes with a stylus.  Use the stylus to touch the screen.  It makes some things more convienent than sifting through a menu.The DS is also more than just a gaming system.  You can set the date, time and even an alarm clock.  The DS is also wireless up to 100 feet.  Using the wireless connection you can go into chatrooms with up to fifteen other people.  It also makes playing multiplayer a lot easier.  No more link cable!The sound is presented in stereo.  There are now two speakers as opposed to one.  Plug in some headphones and the games just sound incredible!As for GBA games.  There's a seperate slot to put them in.  You can select whether you want the GBA to display on the touch screen or top screen.  Regardless, GBA games look clearer than they did before.  They show up much brighter on the DS than previously.The DS also comes with a charger.  As with the GBA it takes about three hours to fully charge.  You can play the DS while it charges as well.In addition to the games.  If you have something you must attend to but don't want to leave the DS on, just flip it closed and the system automatically goes to sleep.  It's much easier than having to press certain buttons or select sleep"" from the menu.But with all the good comes some bad.  Every system has some sort of flaw.  And the DS unfortunately has a few flaws of its own.Firat of all, the games are brutally small.  They're about an ince tall and an inch wide.  If you don't keep your games in some sort of game case, you'll undoubtably lose them.While the DS plays GBA games, it doesn't play normal gameboy games or gameboy color games.  So just because you get a DS doesn't mean you throw your previous GB systems to the side.The buttons are small!  My fingers are pretty big and it sucks to press the ""B"" button and suddenly hit the ""Y"" button along with it.  I was also disappointed to find you can't configure the ""Y"" and ""X"" buttons to act when playing a GBA game.The touch screen is nifty, but the DS almost requires the Stylus.  If you touch the touch screen with your bare hands you could damage it with the oils on your fingers.  The stylus is also small and easy to lose.  Luckily, the DS has a place that stores it for you.  It may also prove troublesome at first to keep your eye on the touch screen and the top screen.Lastly, wireless multiplayer doesn't work with GBA games.  So if you want to play a GBA game up against a friend then you'll still need the GBA link cable to do it.The DS is a wonder, true enough.  But there are a few glaring things about it.  It's worth the money, but a few small things about it may grow into big problems in the long run.  It's an incredible system but the small problems keep it from being perfect.The good+It can handle more power than the GBA+You can still play GBA games+Surround Sound and Stereo!+Touch screen brings more intuitive gameplay+Lavish presentation+Not too complex or complicated to understand+More than just a gaming sytem.  It has a clock, calender and alarm clock set.+Wireless connection of up to 100 Feet+Wireless connection is easy to use+Chat with other DS holders+Small and compact.  It fits in your pocket just like a GBABut of course those cons-You shouldn't touch the touch screen with your fingers-The games are SMALL-You can't play GBC or regular Gameboy games-The buttons are a little small-Wireless Multiplayer doesn't work with GBA gamesA great system with forgiveable cons.

A1ZPVW0WXNJ3YZ,B0006B0O9U,"Alex 47""""",3,3,"Super Mario 64 DS is pretty much the same game that many people may remember from the Nintendo 64 version, Super Mario 64. Super Mario 64 DS just about took that same exact idea and just improve on it by making the amount of stars in this game from 120 to 150, including a splash of some fun minigames, pretty solid multiplayer, and the playable characters Yoshi, Luigi, and Wario. This version is better than the Nintendo 64 version in almost every way. Why? It improved on the already fantastic original game.Graphics: 5/5. The DS's graphical capabilities are nothing compared to the PSP as we all know, but this game delivers the whole Nintendo 64 version of the game on one cartridge, and more. The graphics are a bit sharper and less blocky, but you can see some graphical blurs here and there. Does it matter? No it doesn't, since this game features all levels imaginable from sandy deserts to a cave with a lake to platforms floating on lava. The graphics are extremely sharp and pretty to look at.Sound: 5/5. The sound in this game is the best I've heard from any handheld: period. It is okay when listening without headphones, but with headphones; the sound is awesome. It's surround sound right into your ears. From Mario's Woo-Hoos"" to the sound of collecting a coin, Bowser's laugh, the music... everything sounds spectacular with headphones on.Control: 4/5. The control is fine, but it definitely has some frustrating problems. Occasionaly when time counts to get a star, it can definitely be hard to get where you want to go. Since the camera angles are a little awkward, when in a strange position between 2 or 3 walls and you're trying to jump on a platform, you have to predict. Many times you can't see, but you can normally make it. All other controls in this game are great; it's just the camera angles that prevent this score from going any higher.Fun: 4.5/5. This game has everything Mario fans want in an on-the-go adventure game and more; great graphics, fantastic sound, over 20 great minigames,4 player multiplayer on one cartridge, 4 different playable characters with different abilities, and a not-too-easy-not-too-hard story. If you are craving some on-the-go Mario adventure, this is the only one out there. Why would you need any other adventure game anyways if you have a game like this? This is a must-buy for any DS owner.""",5,Best DS Launch Game; By-Far.,2005/12/9 0:00
A2582KMXLK2P06,B0006B0O9U,B. E Jackson,1,0,"I never should have played the original or this updated version of the most overrated Mario title Nintendo ever released.  The praise this game STILL receives in this day and age, not necessarily for its gameplay but mainly for its influence mind you, is staggering... and sickening.  Super Mario 64 never impressed me at all in the N64 days nearly 18 years ago when I was supposed to swallow the enormous popularity but intelligently never did, and it certainly doesn't impress me now.  Nintendo had a perfect opportunity to finally make this overrated lackluster game into something truly special from a gameplay perspective but they failed to do so.  They could have finally corrected a wrong that's been annoying me for the better part of two decades.You can play as not only Mario but also Luigi, Yoshi and Wario each with their own unique abilities.  You have to search for and pick up their caps scattered throughout the levels, often times worn by the enemies meaning you have to take out the enemies to obtain them.  These are nice additions admittedly and I honestly don't even need to tell you what these abilities are- you already know since they haven't changed in years.  Luigi jumps high?  No way!  Wario's powerful?  Get out of town!  Yoshi spits eggs?  I doubt that!  Yeah, you get the idea.  There's a few other things this game adds that's totally unnecessary such as gigantic-sized Mario that can smash anything in sight for a few seconds, an overused cheap gimmick that would soon explode in eye candy redundancy when the New Super Mario Bros. games would release, and those irritating rabbit chasing games which appeared quite often in the Galaxy series.  The one mistake the Galaxy series made was including so many rabbing chasing obstacles and... Super Mario 64 for the DS gives us more of those than we can honestly handle.  Chasing rabbits is stupid!  The worst part is that there's an extended rabbit grabbing mission both inside and outside the castle when you get close to the end of the game that takes up a good 10 minutes of playtime and it's absolutely terrible.  The bloated floating Mario power-up is kind of cool though.The most unusual and annoying aspect of this game that totally perplexes me is that the levels *still* feel needlessly overlarge.  Nintendo had a ripe opportunity here to fill in all these dreadfully empty and boring areas with tons of goodies to make them feel complete.  I mean why not fill in the empty areas?  Instead Nintendo left these stages the way they are more or less.  They wanted to preserve the game the way most people like it which was of course a bad idea.  Of course the even BIGGER insult is that Nintendo added a few new levels that feel incomplete and outdated just like the regular levels!  Why Nintendo, why?  Why match basic, unfocused blocky-shaped level design with MORE basic, unfocused blocky-shaped level design?  Instead of fixing the outdated-ness of the presentation of the game, Nintendo just throws in a few more simplistically created areas and calls it a day.  Talk about a slap in the face for those of us expecting something more appealing visually.Another really big problem is that in order to grab all 150 stars, we have to go through the same levels AGAIN AND AGAIN!  Talk about repetition at its absolute worse, and going through the same areas over and over will only end up making me want to replay this game even less.  And by less I of course mean never again.  Knowing that the game is STILL intentionally made to force gamers go through the same areas yet again just to obtain another golden star is really pathetic.  Create Mario games either the Super Mario Bros. 3 way where you only have to go through a stage one time before moving on, or the Yoshi's Island way where if you successfully collect everything your first time and 100% a level, you won't have to return to the same stages anymore.  Don't MAKE us go through areas we already completed time and time again for one simple little golden star where the adventure"" getting to it is hardly ever rewarding, challenging or lengthy enough to make an impression anyway.The controls are horrible once again, this time persevering a d-pad instead of a big clunky N64 controller (both ideas fail to work right).  The music is absolutely terrible beyond comprehension.  Having to constantly rearrange camera angles is incredibly outdated and annoying.  Super Mario Galaxy proved that switching camera angles is no longer necessary.  It's WAY too happy which is no doubt deliberate on the part of Nintendo for the entire purpose of rubbing more salt in the wound.  Seriously Nintendo, it's possible to make happy music without the irritating obnoxiousness that only ends up distracting what's clearly already a really lame and outdated game overall.  No need to make the experience even worse with music that makes you want to tear the skin off your body.  An example of quality happy music is the stuff we hear throughout World 1 of Super Mario Bros. 3.  Remember the joyful and innocent music in that game?  The music was tame and never frantically irritating.  In Super Mario 64 DS however, the music's like a hayride from the county fair to the downtown post office that rides on an endless loop in the most annoying way imaginable.  Super Mario Bros. 3 is just one of several examples I could name that shows the way music SHOULD be for a platformer that often times requires concentration to succeed.  At least the remixed soothing water music now with techno-ish beats is decent.  If any other themes have been remixed I can't tell.And we have 30 more stars to collect bringing the total to 150 this time around, which means an extra hour or so to collect everything the game has to offer.  I would mention several other features that drag down this supposed ""classic"" but I already touched upon those subjects in my review for the Nintendo 64 version of Super Mario 64 so there's no need to repeat myself here.  The cuteness factor of certain areas is enough to make me puke though.  I don't mind the occasional childish graphics and objectives, but Super Mario 64 takes the childish aspects to really pathetic depths that feels more intended for babies instead of kids.  Take the penguin race level with the penguins and snowmen for example.  *throws up*  Not something grown men who grew up during the 80's when Mario was fresh, challenging, fast-paced and arcade-like would ever admit to enjoying without blushing.  And what DOES Mario say at the beginning of each level?  ""Let's tickle!""  ""Miss Pickle!"" ""Popsicle!""  There's like a million things he could be saying there.  I was informed he's saying ""Let's a-go"" but I absolutely can't make out those words at all.  I had this same trouble with the N64 version since it's the same exact line lazily copied into this game.Just skip Super Mario 64 DS.  I absolutely loathe this game.  The only reason I gave it another chance is because I thought Nintendo radically changed the game and morphed it into something entirely different by ditching all the old, outdated and tiresome ideas that never worked in the first place and yet only existed in the late 90's because Nintendo was riding the 3D wave and needed something cutting edge on the market.  It's no longer 1996, though.  My how I was wrong on all counts to give this game a second chance on the DS.  The two worst levels have remained which only adds to my anger.  The level where you have to tediously and accurately jump across a series of rotating poles above the water collecting coins, and the rainbow-colored carpet ride which is essentially an auto-scrolling level when you think about it.At least the ghost house is pretty cool.  A piano snapping and chasing me around the room is pretty fun, as is punching enemies and knocking them out for coins.  But uh... coins.  That brings me to another subject and another annoyance.  Absolutely the biggest thing Nintendo should have clearly changed is the ""collect 100 coins for a star"" levels.  This means for several minutes I'm forced to thoroughly explore mediocre levels JUST to obtain enough coins for a star.  A sickening, dreadful, terribly unsatisfying concept if there ever was one.  You'd have to be the most delusional person on the planet to enjoy collecting 100 coins while absorbing these unspectacular levels.  I'm done with this review.  Between gamers believing this game is actually a classic and the little enjoyment I get out of it despite relentlessly giving it more chances, I just can't handle it anymore.""",2,I never should have bothered with this,2014/4/26 0:00

That was really a surprise for Nintendo fanatics with the release of their latest video game creation, the Nintendo DS handheld system. As well as creating new games, they glanced into their vaults, and revived a classic. Super Mario 64, was a ground-breaking and exciting video game for the N64 video game system in 1996, and it was just a masterpiece for all gamers alike. However, that game was truly amazing, remastering a triumph is just anything but intense to all.Super Mario 64 DS, for Nintendo's DS system, has a lot of the same fatures and stories from the previous N64 game, but there are just so many twists here. The game also has a lot of twists, as you play not just Mario, you also control Yoshi, Luigi, and Wario as well. The game also has new extras including new bosses, and mini-games for all. The graphics and the game revised is just amazing. Yet, there are a few downsides with this version. One of those happens to be control. It is a lot harder to control all the characters here with the touchpad, instead of the easy to use analog controller from the N64 version. Another problem is the music and the graphics weren't remastered as well as the classic version, but that is alright because most of the original music and gameplay is really there.All in all, Super Mario 64 DS fairs quite well for anybody who has the desire to own the new Nintendo DS system.

It's even more amazing that the original game has managed to stay virtually unscathed in the translation, with even new additions thrown in as well.  Super Mario 64 DS begins with you controling Yoshi as you wander around the castle grounds trying to figure out what happened to Mario and where Bowser has taken the Princess and hidden the 150 stars (yes, there's more stars to collect here than before).  As you progress, you'll also be able to play as Mario, Luigi, and Wario as you further your mission to collect the stars and defeat Bowser and a host of other baddies; all of which is easier said than done.  Graphically, the game looks nearly identical to the Nintendo 64 classic, which is simply amazing.  Every stage from the original game is here as well, along with some new areas and features for good measure.  There's even some mini-games you can play using the stylus, and more you can unlock by finding stolen keys.  The only real problem with Super Mario 64 DS is that players of the original may have problems switching from the analog stick which worked so well with the original, to the directional pad of the DS.

As you bought it, it came with a launch title. That launch title is...Super Mario 64 for the DS? Yeah, one of the launch titles is really a remake of an old Nintendo 64 game. But you know what's so great about it? That old Nintendo 64 game was one of the best games ever created, and having to experience it on a portable machine was a big thrill.This time, you start out playing as Yoshi. The other playable characters have to be unlocked. Fortunately, Yoshi isn't all that bad. Sure, he can't wall jump like Mario can or even punch, but he can eat up enemies and throw them as eggs! This can upset those with nostalgia, but at least it isn't long before you unlock Mario.Speaking of which, there are lots of new areas to play in. As you enter a new level to unlock a character, you'd end up discovering that there's more to it. You can find red coins, get a Star before it disappears, etc. Even though these levels are new, you'd still have that classic Mario 64 feel. Heck, there are also new missions. Do you remember collecting 5 Silver Stars, or, as already mentioned, race against time to snatch a star, or use Wario to break black bricks? I'm sure you don't. All of this results (Extra levels and missions) in 30 more Stars to collect in this already-big game.Another thing to enjoy is a nice selection of minigames. These can be unlocked by snatching rabbits with keys (instead of Stars), although there already are some minigames to choose from. These minigames play like arcade games: They go on and on, but they are very addicting, or at least, for some, they can go on if you let them.One problem that I find with the game is that there's no analog. For the most part, it plays fine without it, but when it comes to stuff like swinging Bowser's tail, it's just one of those instances where you think that the game should be played with analog and not a stylus or a D-Pad to make things a little easier. Another problem is the multiplayer. It's only a Vs mode, with you and your friend searching for Stars, or beating yourselves up to steal each others'. In early screenshots of the game, I see co-op multiplayer. It disappoints me to realize that you can't team up to fight Bowser in this final product.But overall, it was a fabulous start for the Nintendo DS. It's one of the best games I know, and having the game on the go only increases the fun I'd have with it.

The game still opens up with Princess Toadstool inviting Mario in (and still getting kidnapped).  This time though, Mario has brough Luigi and Wario along!  The three split up and go into the castle.Yoshi then awakens on the top of the castle (where you found him in the original) and notices its eerily quiet and sets out to find the three characters.  You begin the game as Yoshi who doesn't really attack, but can make enemies into eggs and throw them.If you remember the original Super Mario 64, you'll also remember that to begin a course requires you to jump into different paintings.  Each time you jump into a painting you'll be able to select an objective.As you progress through the game you'll note some courses are changed.  Also, there are 30 more stars in this version (bringing the total to 150) to collect.Each character has his own attribute that makes him worthwhile.  Luigi can jump really high, Yoshi makes eggs, Wario is incredibly powerful and Mario is the only character that can do the triangle jump off the walls.  You can change characters at anytime when you're in a course and you'll have to sometimes. You may need Wario to smash a block, or Mario to jump up a wall.Some powerstars are also more troublesome to get than others.  Luckily the DS has a map on one screen.  This map shows you where powerstars are, making some easier to find than others.  Other powerstars that are shown on the map but hidden may actually require memory of the N64 version.The control scheme is where the problem is however.  If the DS had an analog joystick it would've been easier.  I suffered from falling off a cliff more than not simply because the D-Pad isn't as responsive as the joystick.The other problem with the game is that it doesn't utilize the touch screen.  You COULD use it to run and rotate the camara... but it's much easier just to use the controls to do that.  Not only that but using the touch screen to run proves more troublesome than not.  Sadly, there's nothing in which you absolutely have to use the touchscreen. In other words, it doesn't shower as much of the Ninendo DS's power as you'd like.Some parts of the game have aged better than others.  Some courses are just downright silly!  Others are still classics, but it seems as though the trend Super Mario 64 began it can't live up to.  The ""collecting"" trend it began seems a bit overdone in this title.  The battles with Bowser have not lost their flare though.There are also some mini-games that, dare I say, are addictive!  You'll often find yourself playing them over and over again!  There were moments I was so wrapped up playing the mini-games I forgot about the main quest.  The game begins with only eight at first but you'll be able to catch rabbits that unlock other mini-games.Graphic wise, this game is cleaned up and runs smoother than the original N64 version.  The graphics are smoother and the overall presentation is wonderful!  There's nothing better than seeing an old game get a facelift the way Super Mario 64 has. It also runs at a smoother framerate.Soundwise let's just say it's an awesome thing the DS has stereo sound.  It sounds almost exactly like the N64 version.  A great soundtrack that gamers who are familiar with will hum it all over again.  It's incredible nostalgia.It's great to relive a classic.  Some aspects have aged better than others.  I wish Nintendo would have used this game to shower more of what the DS can do but the gameplay more than makes up for it!The Good+Lavish graphics+Runs smoother than the N64 version+More expanded throughout than other re-release games+More characters to play as+Stil hasn't lost its classic feelThe Bad-It doesn't demonstrate everything the DS can do-Some Power Stars require memory of the previous version found on the N64-The Control Scheme isn't as smooth as the original N64 version""",4,The DS launch game to get!,2004/12/24 0:00

If you didn't know by now, Super Mario 64 DS is a faithful port of the classic Super Mario 64, which was released back in 1996. After almost a decade, Mario 64 still stands as the standard for all 3D platforms on any console to date; if you think games like Jak and Daxter, Ratchet and Clank and even Banjo-Kazooie rival or best the ingenuity of Mario 64, then you have been completely mistaken: Those games are great because they used Mario 64's blueprint-- they should be viewed as homages to the finest 3D platformer ever, and that's that. Mario DS takes the graphics and gameplay of the 1996 classic and adds a fresh coat of paint to them. This time around, players control not only Mario but Yoshi, Wario and Luigi as well. While this approach could have been a short-lived novelty by all accounts, it succeeds by utilizing different attributes to each character a la Super Mario Bros. 2-- Mario is well-balanced, Luigi can jump higher than the other characters, and Yoshi is much more sprightly that his counterparts. Wario, on the other hand, is a sluggish oaf who makes up for his shortcomings with extra muscle-- the addition of these character attributes adds more depth and replay to a game that was never lacking in either department in the first place.",5,"It's a me, Mario!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2005/4/4 0:00

When GTA:2 came out, it had very similar reviews: mixed ones. However, when GTA:3 came out for the PS2 about 5 years ago, everything changed. The game got between 8-10 ratings everywhere. ( Mostly 9-10 ) The GTA series had gone full 3D and made for an extremely fun title to play. Vice City also came out about 2 years later, and it also got rave reviews. San Andreas came out not too long ago and got great reviews, too. But now, Rockstar has decided to put GTA on the PSP, and it is a great game. It takes GTA 3, and puts it on a handheld; the WHOLE game.This game is different than GTA 3 because it has an entirely different story.

It looked and played just like the original PS1 versions of Grand Theft Auto, only in portable form. So, when i heard they were coming out with Liberty City Stories for the PSP, I'll admit..I was a bit skeptical that they'd do a game like GTA3 justice on the handheld(especially after Midnight Club 3 Dub Edition). Yet, after getting Liberty City Stories, I must say I'm simply amazed at what Rockstar did with the game. Load times, which were my biggest concern, were minimal. The game looks and plays like GTA3(and future iterations of it) and, in some ways, one ups it. While it takes place in Liberty City(a town we all are intimately familiar with), the missions and storyline are all new.Multiplayer modes are new and fresh for the series. After three games like this, for the PS2, I thought I'd be burned out playing yet another game but, after playing the handheld version, I became more immersed into the GTA mythos. It being a handheld version added a whole new dimension to things. Sure, controls were a bit odd since there is only one analog stick among a few other lil nitpickey things about the game. Make no mistake, though, Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories is the Definitive PSP game that everyone should add to their PSP game collection.In my opinion, games on the PSP have been no more than PS1 games with a PS2 graphical shine(not that it's a bad thing)...that is til this game came out. Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories is a game that proves just what the Playstation Portable is truly capable of and is a game that all other PSP games should strive to match. If developers strived to match what Liberty City Stories accomplishes, just think of what type of games we could see on the system. Portable versions of Tony Hawks' American Wasteland, True Crime, Gun, or Call of Duty, perhaps? How about Champions of Norrath, or Final Fantasy? Only time will tell.Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories is a great addition to the Grand Theft Auto games.

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0007TS24U,"Cloud ...""""",0,0,"A lot of times when you buy a new system, you tend to check out the games that are sort of unanimously agreed on as a game to get. After awhile of playing my DS and Wii, I thought I'd give in and get a PSP as well and many games were suggested or looked intriguing but familiarity and a good price brought me to Liberty City Stories. While the content isn't exactly for all ages, LCS shows what exactly Sony's tiny machine can pull off and aside from a few hiccups, this is a great game to check out for recent PSP purchasers or longtime owners - provided you're old enough for this of course.Story: Taking place in 1998, 3 years before the original Grand Theft Auto III, Tony Cipriani as just arrived to Liberty City after laying low from killing a made man"" which is a big mafia no-no. But his absence has left others taking over what he had so Tony has to rise up again in the ranks and take on various tasks to be where he used to be or maybe even further.Graphics: Despite its smaller system, the PSP always looked like it could handle more complex games like God of War or Crisis Core and while graphically LCS doesn't impress on a aesthetic level, the fact it's even on this system with all 3 islands (Portland Island, Staunton Island and Shoreside Vale), the streets and the exact map layout of each. As for how the game looks, the GTA series has never really had an attractive look and on the PSP, it's a bit more forgiveable.Sound/Music: The GTA series has always had great voice acting and in this one, there's a few notable roles that work well while others just don't really fit and lack a certain something. Tony for example doesn't really have the drive of Tommy or the care of CJ (yes I said care), this guy just feels more ""angry mode"" than anything. The music comes from the radio stations when you're on a vehicle and I never did like GTA3's radio stations and often listened to the Chatterbox though in some cases on a more intense mission, I had big operatic orchestral music on like Double Clef FM.Gameplay: III started the whole ""open-ended gameplay"" that many have been copying which allow you to traverse the city and do whatever you feel like. That's here as well from taxi and vigilante missions to the main stories, or just doing insane jumps and finding hidden packages, completists could have a ball with this one. The main story missions are the same as always: pick someone up and drop em off and/or shake off cops, blow up something or go on assassin sprees where you have to off someone. The problem comes in the narrative where there was always a drive to the missions but since the story wasn't that intriguing, the missions felt more like tasks to do or errands.Controlling on the PSP did feel different since I was so used to the Dual Shock and the analog gets the job done although sometimes it was too finicky with me trying to correct myself and the lack of a good camera control doesn't help. Pushing the L shoulder and moving the analog allows a rotating camera but it always felt awkward. The other notable problem is the targeting system where it's way too easy to target civilians or others instead of the guy you want and enabling the free-aim by pressing the down button felt sluggish and it's best to just reposition. Other than that, the game still controls the same, although you can't swim (poo).If you're old enough and were a fan of the game, it's a good idea to check out Liberty City Stories. It's not quite the best in the series or the worst but it's worth looking into it anyway.""",5,4.5; Impressive for a handheld game,2008/4/2 0:00

While GTA: LCS is not the killer app"" that GTA 3 was for the PS2, it's nonetheless tons of fun and endless excitment, coupled with lots of handheld violence and one-person mayhem.There's no doubt that this is simply the best PSP game so far, and it takes full advantage of the PSP's processing and graphic powers.  The graphics is fantastic on the PSP, and the framerate for the most part excellent.  A couple times you'll notice some choppiness, but otherwise it's just like on the good ol' PS2.  The controls are mostly good, except this game inherits the maddening aiming scheme from GTA 3, so when you are in the middle of a Godfather-like shootout, you'll wish for better aiming controls.  But that's just a minor complaint.What stopped me from rating this 5 stars -- my inclination is to give it an overall rating of 4.5 stars (90%) -- is the level design is just too similar to GTA 3.  You are back in Liberty City, with pretty much the same layouts.  Neighborhood names have changed, but otherwise the environment and the characters look (and sound) exactly the same.  The gameplay is also pretty much the same, which is great but at the same time a little, shall we say, hackneyed.Still, this is a must-have title for any PSP gamers.""",4,Must-have fun for the PSP,2005/11/10 0:00

LCS feels like a port of the GTA3 engine, but feels nice on the PSP. Everything you love about GTA is intact here and is a great first outing for the little handheld that could. Like all other GTAs you play as a man who is trying to climb to the top of the city.The missions are varied and well put together, but extremely frustrating. I had to use cheats a lot since the game is highly unforgiving. They will put way to many guys in one spot for you, and this is due to targeting and shooting issues. When you lock on with R Toni will target the closest target, but camera issues hinder this. If you have someone shooting behind you you have to turn around, tap L to reset the camera, lock on, then shoot. In this amount of time you will be dead. This is probably the biggest issue in the whole game. Most of the same issues are carried over from GTA3 and this also includes graphical issues like pop-up, weird collision detection, and some audio glitches.The game is surprisingly busy for a handheld game with cars and pedestrians everywhere, you can do everything you could in GTA3 like steal cars, do taxi, police, and fire truck missions. Unlike GTA3, however, you can ride motor cycles. There are a ton of weapons to use in the game, tons of cars, and lots of missions to do. Missions vary from escorting, on rail shooting, protecting, delivering, stocking, and assassinating. The characters in the game are lively and the dialog is awesome. The radio stations talk shows are my favorite part in the game. They are hilarious and completely outrageous like GTA should be. There aren't enough of them though (about 5) and after you get into 5+ hours into the game they get repetitive, and the same goes for the commercials. The songs however aren't very good, and I don't even think any of them are licensed. This can be changed by playing custom songs off your memory stick, but it requires a weird converter on your PC and isn't very user friendly, but its there and I love it. In fact LCS was the first PSP game to use custom soundtracks so kudos to Rockstar for doing this.The game looks very good for a 2005 PSP game. It looks like an upgraded version of GTA3 which isn't bad, but if love GTA4 and have the pre-GTA4 games you will not like this at all. Some times the game can look really good when you riding into the sunrise and light is reflecting off the water and everything around you. Everything is actually 3D and doesn't look flat and retarded like you might think.

AQMWZIH22R6LE,B0007TS24U,"TwistaG Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore""""",7,4,"GTA: Liberty City Stories is the first game in the series to hit the PSP, and you can bet it won't be the last. Given the dismal crop of PSP titles currently available, an original PSP-only GTA game couldn't have arrived at a better time. And the good news is, Liberty City Stories is a real Grand Theft Auto game, through and through. Whether you love the GTA series or despite it, the fact is that Liberty City Stories is on the same quality level as its bigger brothers on the PS2, Xbox, and PC. You'll be surprised by how few compromises Rockstar made in order to bring the world of Grand Theft Auto to the PSP. On a visual level, the game looks simply awesome. It's not quite as detailed as Vice City or San Andreas, but it absolutely destroys the original GTA 3. The graphics look so clear that you can read the type on fliers and billboards posted around town, even on the small-ish PSP screen. As series fans well know, the game is set in the New York-inspired Liberty City. Liberty City itself is ripped straight from GTA3, and it's never looked better. From the huge crowds of pedestrians to the cars, you'd be hard-pressed to tell Liberty City Stories from GTA3. Toni himself looks fine, if a tad blocky. But in a welcome piece of news, many of the legacy character animations have finally been replaced, so longtime GTA fans won't have to keep looking at the same stupid jump animation that plagued that last three games. Liberty City Stories comes up a tad short when it comes to special effects; you'll notice that effects like explosions won't draw unless they're fairly close to you. But the weather effects are spot-on (and now include snow!), so it's a worthy trade-off. We could do without the infamous blur effect, though. And, there is a noticeable bit of ghosting on the PSP screen--especially when Toni runs; not the game's fault, but it should definitely be noted. Perhaps most important of all is the fact that, despite its visual beauty, Liberty City Stories runs butter-smooth. Even during heated action or driving scenes, you'll be hard-pressed to spot any framerate stuttering. The core gameplay is ripped straight from earlier entries in the series, so you'll find that Toni can't pull himself onto walls or boost his stats like C.J. could in San Andreas. But aside from a few tiny compromises--you can no longer crouch, for instance--this is the exact same GTA you know and love. We think that's damn impressive. The single-player mode pits you against a succession of missions and side missions, just like the console versions, and this approach holds up very well for brief snatches of gameplay on the bus or the train. When it comes to handheld gameplay, Liberty City Stories is just a natural. We especially love the new PSP-only multiplayer mode, which stands as perhaps the biggest single reason to pick up the game. Up to six players can compete in a local (or ad-hoc"") wi-fi match. There are seven modes in all, and they range from standard deathmatch (Liberty City Survivor) and races (Street Rage) to more sophisticated team-based games where you sabotage enemy cars (Protection Racket) or steal tanks (Tanks for the Memories). Our favorite?:Hit List, an addictive little game for larger groups. In that mode, one player becomes the target while the other players relentlessly stalk him through the city. Fun! Now for the nerdy stuff. The UMD loading speed is surprisingly fast, but load scenes still popped up little too frequently for our tastes. We also appreciate the fact that Rockstar supports custom soundtracks, but we detest the highly limited system that they're using to implement them--you're essentially forced to rip a CD straight to your PSP's memory card. Not an ideal solution at all. But those are quibbling details. Liberty City Stories is a truly worthy entry in the Grand Theft Auto series. In fact, if you hated the crudely-implemented RPG elements of San Andreas, you might actually prefer this game's simpler approach. Regardless, this is the game that will finally make the PSP a must-own handheld device. You should buy it immediately.""",5,best portable gta yet,2005/12/26 0:00

I have only played for a couple of days, but I must confess that I am quite pleased at the result of adding a new dimension to the gameplay.For starters, the environment (including the ""overworld"" is now fully interactive. There are set roads the player may travel, but one may also branch off of these roads to find new caves, treasure chests and secrets galore. Hence, it trumps FFX in this regard (although the playable demo of FFXII included in the game already has me salivating!). Furthermore, some walls contain secret passages, etc., and in general the game offers full movement in the world and secrets which are only made possible in the 3-D setting.As for the gameplay (and here may be a bit of fanboy-itis, I'll admit), the game is much more fun than its predecessor. Gone is the cumbersome class system of DWVII (which I personally liked, but many hated), and in its place is a very easy to learn skill system. Each party member has five skills which they can raise any way they like. Skill points are awarded at level ups, and as skills gain more points (and the point distribution is entirely up to the player), the party member will gain battle spells and ""traits"", which are essentially bonuses to attack, defense, etc. The game is quite linear at the front, but I know of a few sidequests later in the game which will give the player more freedom to choose his path.As for the graphics, well, they don't stand up next to the might of the FFXII demo packaged alongside, but the cel-shading seems perfect to bring out the charm of Akira Toriyama's character and monster designs. However, I am surprised that the female character can manage to keep her incredibly-revealing top on!In any case, this is a worthy addition to the ""Dragon Warrior"" legacy, and a fine game in its own right.

I typically stick with the DS for RPGs nowadays, but thought what they heck... But I'm not reviewing the other games or systems.  So here goes:This game is so remarkable for one big reason:  Keeping the core of the classic game with a shiny new appearance!  This is the first (and only) DQ to have a truly 3-d interface (meaning you can look at length, width, height - not that 3-d stuff like Avatar).  I was worried that using the new model, SE would lose the classic feel of this game.  Not so!  Instead you have rich, cartoony expanses of wilderness and towns to explore.  Random encounters are the norm here.  But you never really feel irritated when a baddie pops up.  The game presents a nice challenge in battles without feeling 'cheap' or that it is 'cheating'.  Combat is turn based, so plan your actions accordingly.  The nice aspect is that is seems that heal spells get bumped up a bit to the beginning of the turn, so if you have someone who is near death, then you can usually save them.  But sometimes not!Again, the challenge is nice.  There are many side quests and hunting and catching special monsters for the 'arena' is a fun way to pass the time and come up with some great items.The cast is fantastic.  Akira Toriyama worked his magic.  The characters are unique, though Angelo does look a lot like future Trunks from DBZ... and the hero does come off a little like Crono, but that's a compliment (to the silent hero).  The English voice acting is mostly top notch.  The actors are mostly British, so it adds a fun little element of a foreign feeling to the game.  Yangus and Trode are real treats to watch!  Sometimes I was laughing out loud.Towards the middle of the game, the world really opens up and you can spend a lot of time exploring and level grinding.  If you don't the upcoming portion is more difficult, but not really impossible.  The ship really is a nice touch and is a joy to pilot.  The bird later on is the standard DQ mode of enemy free transportation.The story starts kind of silly in places, but is really quite powerful at the heart.  Dhoulmagus is an amazing villain in the same vein as Kefka from FF6... just insane and evil.This is a seriously deep game that can consume well over 80 hours of a gamer's free time.

A2GBBDNZLYC4A9,B0009A4EV2,"Jeff Johnson Jeff Johnson""""",0,0,"This is a fantastic turn based role playing game from a long lineage and history of the Dragon Quest franchise. For starters, all of the classic enemies and their cartoon-esque art style are here fleshed out in 3D. The turn based battles feel great as ever, but there is some depth to said combat. When you level up you get your standard stats increase, but now you get extra points to pool into combat traits such as swords, spears, clubs, unarmed combat, courage and so on. Each character has different trait abilities. These stats will give you abilities to use in battle that are different than spells. Abilities like Heart breaker, penny pincher, monster masher, blow kiss and a lot of others.There is a very competent tactics system where you can assign certain party members to take certain actions during combat. You can still control them if you want to, but if you don't, you can have them show no mercy, fight wisely, focus on healing, don't use magic, get psyched up or follow your orders. The choice is yours, but it does save on brain cells not having to think about who will do what or if you've got a very young player that isn't playing for the combat.The menu system feels a little cumbersome and it takes a longer time than it should to do things. The menu is broken down into items, where each party member has their inventory to equip things and a bag that holds your excess. In battle, you can only use items that character holds and cannot use anything from the bag, which makes sense. The magic menu where you can use a character's spells. Attributes to see character stats, traits, abilities, bio and so on. Finally there is the miscellaneous section, where you can easily heal everyone with the push of a button (that will automatically use magic and items to replenish health), tactics, line-up, equipment, settings, help, battle records and an interesting new alchemy pot, where you can take useless items and make them more useful.The game follows the player from a third person perspective and you have very good control over the camera. The game has you walking around towns which are safe from enemies and the wilderness which is not safe. Random monster battles will happen. You will not see a monster on the map (just in rare occasions), but rather you will just be taken to a fight screen with the foes. All of the monsters have good animations and a sense of charm and personality. The 3D and animations really bring everything to life nicely. Better yet, the enemies have a lot of combat diversity that adds a lot and makes you think. Diversity far from just spells and attacks, but some enemies flip when hit to reveal a stronger version. Some enemies start the battle sleeping allowing the player to run away or take advantage. There are plenty of status ailments like sleep, poison, paralysis, curse, mute and so on (Pretty standard stuff).Now let's talk about the story. Normally, I don't care much for story, but this game has a surprisingly good and rich story with plenty of characters to get attatched to. Your character is the silent protagonist. Yangus is the brute comedy figure, Jessica is the bold young lady you meet 2 missions in, Angelo is the charming ladies man that works for the templar that you will find a few hours into the game. It is all held together by the cursed king. Some short frog like humanoid creature and his horse of a daughter Madea. Hence the name Journey of the Cursed King. You are all following a strange jester villain that literally has affected everything in the story. Quest after quest is tied to this jester. It is nice storytelling.Each quest... or I should say chapter in the story is around 2+ hours between battles, travel, your exploring and cut scenes. Speaking of cut scenes, they are voice acted for the most part. Some voice acting is quality, but it feels like they recycled some voice actors doing triple duty. You end up reading a lot quicker than their voice acting, but you can skip to the next bit of dialog (box). The townspeople are not voice acted, but rather dialog boxes at the bottom of your screen as is the traditional RPG format.If you come back from a long downtime of not playing, the game reminds you that you can ask your party what to do to get back on track. This works excellently like a hint system or a friendly reminder.All and all, his is a fantastic game for anyone who likes turn based role playing games. You really can develop your characters to how you play. Its deep, but you can still play it on a shallow level. There is exploration, but you won't get lost with clearly defined paths. A lot of dungeons and outdoor areas you can just go straight to find your goal, but you can look off the path to find treasures and other quirky things.",5,"An excellent RPG with great combat, rich story and characters.

A2LPJD19MGBNXJ,B0009A4EVM,"Adrian Jenkins southerndudeman""""",3,2,"...but not a great one.I'll understand if some of you disagree with me, even loathe me, for what I'm about to write. Indeed, I didn't want to believe it myself. During my KH2 experience, I wanted to think this was the best game I've played on the PS2, and at times, I was spot-on. Yet, in conclusion, there was an emptiness, a longing for something more, that i simply could not ignore.First, the good. KH2 is the long awaited sequel to Kingdom Hearts, disregading the GBA Chain of Memories"", which was a very different (but interesting in its own right) experience from the first. The story begins where ""Chain of Memories"" left off, although prior knowledge of that game is unnecessary to enjoy this one. I'd rather not spoil ANY of the story, unlike some other reviewers here, but I will say that you begin the game not as Sora, but as Roxas, a young boy who seems to dream of Sora on a regular basis.The good of this game is VERY good. The control is vastly improved over its predecessor, and with a free camera, you won't  be hating those long battles or that search for an ever elusive treasure chest. Levelling occurs in two varieties - on the one hand, you will gain standard levels for defeating regular field enemies, and will get gains in categories such as strength, defense, magic, etc. However, there are other ""bonus"" levels acquired by defeating boss monsters or surviving certain events, and here you gain new abilities, more HP, etc.The battles are excellent, and cure many of the ills of the predecessor. Rather than hoping you can change your stack command to make use of that special attack (as in the original), KH2 introduces ""Reaction commands"". By pressing the triangle button at opportune times, Sora and company can fire off amazing pre-emptive and counter- attacks against just about any foe in the game. Sometimes, these commands are absolutely vital (such as the fight against Sephiroth or other members of Organization XIII), for without them, you'll be wiped out. All in all, one must stay on his toes throughout the battle - many enemies use special attacks when near death (truthfully, I'm not sure if this is good or bad in the game).Unfortunately, there is much that is NOT good in this game. Despite some breathtaking battles, the actual discovery portion of the game is quite lacking. At times, your goal is to move forward, one battle at a time, along a completely linear map. This would be perfectly fine if the storyline was any better, but it is very disjointed. At one moment, you're fighting Disney villains and heartless out to rule the world, and then suddenly they're...helping you? No motivation, mind you, is given for this change in tactic. It just happens, and then the villains simply vanish. Moreover, characters are introduced and then ignored for most of the quest (Roxas immediately comes to mind).Finally, there is a ""cheese"" factor involved in many of the battles (I lifted this term from gameFAQ's, mind you). Here you are, moving merrily along through a difficult battle until WHOOPS! here are 10 water demons that you must destroy in 10 seconds or its GAME OVER! And just when you thought you were done with the cheese WHOOPS! Here comes Xaldin riding a dragon which makes him invulnerable against your attacks, while kicking your tail from here to Halloween Town! It makes the game synthetically longer, as you will simply lose the battles the first two or three times you fight them. As for the reviewer who says this game is easy, and you can level to lvl 99 in a matter of a week, don't you believe it. There is NOTHING easy about the battle against Sephiroth or (even worse) the 49th battle in the Hades Cup tournament.And when you finish the game, many of you will be left with a ""huh""? or at best a ""meh."" Things wrap up far too easily in KH2 (unlike its predecessor, which had a very strong story in retrospect). So to quote a famous poet, my final take on KH2 is this: Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""",4,A good game...,2006/4/25 0:00
AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B0009A4EV2,"N. Durham Big Evil""""",4,4,"Next to the Final Fantasy series, the Dragon Quest series is probably the best known RPG series in the video game world.  Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King not only proves this statement even more so, but makes a true, worthy debut on the PS2 with a revamped look, and an engrossing and engaging story.  Without giving too much in the latter department away, Dragon Quest VIII manages to keep the gamer enthralled while you take on hordes of enemies in the tried but true random and turn based battle system.  While a majority of these battles are difficult and even borderline on annoying, Dragon Quest VIII still manages to pack in enough originality to a tired genre and presentation thanks to some brilliantly designed monsters, landscapes, and characters in your party.  While they may seem like cardboard cutout copies of atypical RPG characters, each person you meet and engage has their own unique personality.  The game also boasts some gorgeous graphics for a PS2 game, not to mention some wonderful music and voice acting to boot.  The game's unique charm and humor combined with a lengthy quest all helo make Dragon Quest VIII even more of a slam dunk.  RPG's rarely get any better than this.  If you missed out on Dragon Quest VIII when it first came out, you have no reason to miss out on it now.  This isn't only one of the best RPG's you'll ever play, it's one of the best games ever for PS2 regardless of the genre.",5,"One of the best games, ever, for the PS2",2007/3/22 0:00
A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B0009A4EV2,S. Rhodes,7,7,"Dragon Quest VIII not only marks the first Dragon Quest game on the PS2 (in the states they were previously known as Dragon Warrior) but also marks the first fully three-dimensional one in the series, and I must say it looks aboslutely stunning!  Former fans and new fans can rejoice at the sheer brilliance of Dragon Quest VIII!An evil wizard named Dhoulmagus has gotten hold of a legendary scepter and has placed a curse on the castle which he got it from.  He has turned the King into a frog, and the Princess into a horse.  You, a lonely knight, are one of few to survive the attack.  Now you and a set of friends, King Trote and Yagnus, will set off on a quest to find this evil wizard and break the spell.In addition, you'll meet up with two other characters named Jessica and Angelo, who will join you in your quest.  There aren't a whole lot of characters in Dragon Quest VIII, but at least each one is unique.  Each character also has their own strengths in battle that'll prove useful to you either way.Battling is a simple turn-based battle system.  You select commands and then watch your characters tear the enemy to shreds.  The battles occur at random, but they don't pop up too often, and they're often fun.  Battles are also quick.  You can select attacks and use magic spells.  Some spells attack the enemy, some raise stats.  No different than your usual turn based RPG.In addition to the battle system, you've also got skill points.  You gain skill points by gaining levels.  Each character has four weapon skills you can spend skill points on.  Weapons like your swords, axes... so on and so forth.  Each character also has something unique for them that you can spend ability points on.  The more you spend, the better the skill.Battling is now always easy, though.  Most Dragon Quest veterans know this.  When you could be thrust into a battle with eight enemies (and there are only four of you) things can get hectic with enemies constantly healing each other, calling for back up, and even reviving dead allies!  This seems annoying, but it makes for a much more unique RPG.  One where you don't have to hold down the attack button.  You can't just go into a battle thinking that attacking is all you'll do.  Battling in Dragon Quest VIII actually calls for strategy.If you lose a battle, though, have no fear.  Unlike most RPGs, Dragon Quest doesn't have the dreaded Game Over"" screen.  You simply are reverted back to the church where you last saved.  You lose half your money, a small price to pay in the long run (or a hefty price, depending on how you look at it).If you do find yourself getting into lots of trouble, you'll more than likely be well prepared for the worst.  You learn a spell that helps you escape from dungeons fairly early in the game, and most of your healing assets don't cost too much money.  The game is a challenge, but not impossible.The graphics of this game are absolutely spectacular!  Fans of Dragon Ball Z or Chrono Trigger will be happy to know Akira Toriyama was brought on board to shape the world in which you're playing.  The character movements are smooth, the frame rate is consistent.  And if you're an old school gamer, the enemy designs haven't changed much.  I think some will appreciate that.  If you're not an old school gamer, fear not; the monsters aren't the same old cardboard cutouts they used to be, either.  I can't express enough how gorgeous these in-battle graphics are!  They're fast, and you'll be instantly stunned by it's beauty.The music is just as stunning as the visuals!  From the music made in dungeons and the overworld map to the voice acting.  It all shines with nothing but sheer brilliance.The game is long, and full of side quests as well.  You'll easily be playing for more than fifty hours.  The only downside to how long it'll take you is the same one that plagues most Dragon Quest games.  You'll probably spend a lot of that time leveling up.Overall, Dragon Quest VIII is worth your hard-earned cash.  Fixing the problems that once plagued the series, it deserves your gratitude.  An engaging tale, gorgeous graphics and sound, great characters--what's not to like?  Grab it, you won't be sorry.The Good+An Engaging Storyline+GORGEOUS GRAPHICS+Excellent Voice Acting+Excellent Sound+Battling is fun, fast, and simple+Wonderful character development+It includes a demo of Final Fantasy XII!The Bad-Random Battles Are Tough-Some may feel there are not enough characters-The game is long, but most of it you'll no doubt spend leveling up.I assure you those small qualms won't turn you away from this instant classic.""",5,ABSOLUTELY STUNNING!,2005/11/16 0:00
A1ZPVW0WXNJ3YZ,B0009A4EVM,"Alex 47""""",9,4,"Kingdom Hearts was great; a lot of fun; awesome story; fun to play; this game is none of these.KH2 ties in the story from the original, and the Gameboy Advanced version, Chain of Memories. I played Chain of Memories, but didn't beat it, so the story is extremely confusing to me in this game. All I know is that Sora/Roxas keeps going in and out of what I call comas"" and they make no sense; they are just flashbacks to Kingdom Hearts. This story line is whacked and annoying. The game also starts off EXTREMELY slow for about the first 3 hours or so.Graphics: 8/10. The graphics are OKAY... people say they look A LOT better than the original, but they don't. If you ask me, there is a very slight texture difference on characters and whatnot, other than that, there is really no difference at all.Sound: 8/10. Yeah... some licensed Disney songs are in this game, of course, but there are also some annoying made tunes for this game that are extremely annoying and pointless... the game would have been better off without it.Control: 7.5/10.

This game fails more than it does succeeds, and it did not meet the level of hype it recieved. This is a so-so game that in no way can ever compare to the original. Sure it's a good play with great characters and fun levels, but the repetitiousness (is that a word?) of this game is ridiculous, and you will do a LOT of backtracking. It's also not very fun seeing videos of them sitting down and talking about nothing. ( Them being ""Roxas"" and his buddies in the begining of the game ) They talk about CRAP and just munch on random blue popsicles all the time. Did I mention they freak out when the beach is mentioned? ""It's summer and we haven't been to the beach yet!"" ...Oh yay... ""LET'S GET SOME PRETZELS!!"" And that's not the only time they get excited by pretzels... anyways, like I said, this is a game that people should play, but it's not as good as people say it is on this website. Trust me.

Kingdom Hearts II is an improvement over the original.  Maybe not a big improvement, but enough to consider purchasing.The graphics are really good and the difficulty is unfortunately, sort of easy.  The game is really big and contains a MONSTER storyline so it's not like the easiness means you can blow through the game on a lazy Saturday afternoon.  It just means you won't have much trouble moving through the game.  I guess Axel was a fairly challenging fight.

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0009A4EVM,"Cloud ...""""",9,9,"A lot of sequels are based on adding a couple things to make it different it's fundamentally the same. Kingdom Hearts was an action RPG that was marred by a loathesome camera, a shifting difficulty and hack and slash battle system. While there's some camera problems, it's overall a much improved game with slight difficulty problems for some and some new additions to its battle system.Story: Never played Chain of Memories but the game picks up afterwards. Sora's back as well as Donald and Goofy, as well as a new type of enemy called Nobodies and a group known as Organization XIII. You'll also travel to worlds with little mini-plots.Graphics: Some improvements from the first one with slight noticeable enhancements. The Pirates of the Caribbean level looks pretty great for the facial detail and in-game graphics look more detailed than before. Sora's new moves greatly benefit from the new graphics as well.Sound/Music: The music is always spot-on except the themes you might not like. Voice acting is kind of a mixed bag with Haley Joel Osment and Hayden Panettiere doing good jobs as always but then we have the ghastly sounding Aeris by Mena Suvari or the hick sounding Cid. Another offender is whoever did Scar's voice, it's so emotionless it was painful and funny to hear. There's also lots of sound alikes that are kind of distracting.Gameplay: Nothing much changed except for a few new things. Added is the Drive system where Sora combines with Donald or Goofy for the Wisdom Form or Valor Form respectively. They're more stronger versions of the characters in a way. Sora's got some added combos that makes him a bit more of a powerhouse than last time. Also added is Reaction Commands, certain moves you can do against an enemy. Example is fighting Cerberus and instead of being chomped on, you press Triangle and you do some moves for some good damage. Only complaint is that quite a few enemies don't even have any.As for difficulty, some say it's way too easy even on hard mode, others struggle through it and keep getting hit. It's kind of unbalanced at times since some enemies are no problem while others won't even let you attack and they cheap shot from the back. That last round of bosses in particular will probably make you start swearing too. Also munny personally is rather scarce. In the first one, I usually had 1000 leftover by the time I finished shopping for items and equipment, here I barely have 40 bucks by the end of everything.It's the rare sequel that tops the original. Yes it's got extremely minor flaws and it might rear its ugly head but you end up ignoring it.

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B0009A4EVM,S. Rhodes,35,31,"Very rarely does a sequel out do the original, but Kingdom Hearts II manages to do it.  Not only does this improve on many aspects of the original, but it utilizes the same formula that worked very well in the first game.Once again you'll play as Sora visiting different sets of Disney worlds.  Each Disney world has its own plot that is very similar to that of the movies.  Some lines are even ripped straight from the movies.  That's not such a bad thing, of course.  At least for Disney fanatics.There's no doubt Kingdom Hearts II definitely improves on the gameplay.  Yes, it is still the same old hack and slash battle system of the original.  And yes, when you go into a world you'll go with Donald and Goofy, and be given a character to substitute. There have been a few additions, however, and they're welcome.  These tweaks have obviously been tuned up by Square-Enix.  Aside from being able to cast numerous spells and summon other disney characters, Kingdom Hearts II introduces limit breaks.  Where your entire party will perform a devastating attack.  It drains all your MP (of every character) but it's pretty darn powerful, and helps out.  The game also introduces drives which will have you combining with other characters to perform some devastating attacks.  These additions are welcome to the universe of Kingdom Hearts, despite the fact that the game is so easy you probably won't need them.  However, whenever there are small tweaks made to the gameplay they're welcome so long as it keeps the game interesting.There is a whole new set of Disney worlds introduced in Kingdom Hearts II.  Including the first Disney cartoon Steamboat Willie and Pirates of the Caribbean.  Each world, as I've noted has a smiliar plot and voice over to the movies.  This isn't so bad because the disney characters actually sound like their disney characters.  This is another strength of Kingdom Hearts II.  There's an all star voice-over cast.  You'll recognize the voices of characters and they're spot on.  For a game with as many voices as Kingdom Hearts, it's certainly nice to see that not a single voice is lackluster.  Some of the dialogue comes directly from the movies, and this probably won't bother Disney fanatics either.Although, for Square-Enix fans, I can't say the same for the Final Fantasy aspect of the game.  Final Fantasy characters aren't nearly as well fleshed out as Disney characters.  It's great that they're here and all, but they don't play an integral part in the storyline, and they're often given bad dialogue.  It's the only moment where you'll question Kingdom Hearts II.Graphically the game is solid.  Being one of the best looking on the Playstation 2.  Everything is vibrant and colorful and definitely has a great appeal.  Especially to people who enjoy Disney.  They've got the big feet, gloves and everything.  The final fantasy characters also look really good.  Even though some may not like that some of them look a little kiddie, it isn't really anything to be too upset about.  It's only keeping with the style of the game.Musically Kingdom Hearts II sounds great.  Most tunes you'll instantly recognize from your favorite Disney movie, and it'll be no surprise if you find yourself humming these tunes.  If you love Disney music, you'll love the music of this game.  The outside tunes also sound really great.Rarely is a second installment better than the first.  Kingdom Hearts II succeeds by improving the gameplay, and fixing a few things that kept the first one down such as the horrible camera angles.  While it could've used a bit more Final Fantasy influence, Kingdom Hearts II is a solid game.  Those who loved the first one will fall in love all over again with the second one.The Good+Outstanding graphics+Great Gameplay+Music is great+All-Star Voice Acting cast+A longer more fleshed out game than the first one+Several different worlds+New summon spellsThe Bad-The game is a little too easy.  Even though they've got these new, cool additions, you most likely won't need them.

A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B0009I6S0O,"ACEMAN1 HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""""",2,1,"I'm a gamer who has only owned my beloved PS2 for two months. I was eight years late to the PS2 party, but it's amazing how a single game can pull you in on the console and refuse to let you stop playing for long periods of time even if you've delayed owning the system. Personally I hope the PS2 never dies and Sony just kills the PS3 (Just kill it, there's no point in keeping it alive anymore). Shadow of the Colossus is absolutely fantastic and breathed new life into the stale adventure genre with a bang. This game may be tough as hell to beat, but it's totally worth the price of admission.WHAT THE GAME IS: It's an adventure game that feels somewhat like Zelda. A boy (name unknown) brings a dead girl's body to a temple and makes a deal with the spirits of the temple to bring the dead girl back to life by defeating 16 giant behemoth creatures called Colossus. So the boy and his horse Aggro travel across the land defeating these creatures, armed with a magical sword and a bow and arrow set.GRAPHICS: This game is one of the best looking titles to be released for the PS2, and it pushes the console to its limits. The environments are gorgeous, the creature designs are great, the character models are great, and everything seems alive around you. However, the PS2 is known for texture and lighting problems, and unfortunately this game suffers as well with some textures being blurry and the lighting seems to be a bit off. Also, the frame-rate chugs if the battles get too hectic.MUSIC: The music is sublime and magnificent. This musical score is among the best I've ever heard from in a game. It is nearly perfect and it fits the fantasy theme perfectly. Hell, it's good enough to be featured in a big-budget Hollywood flick. But I do wish that the music would play all the time, not just during cutscenes and the colossus battles. It doesn't play as you explore the vast land placed before you which is disappointing.SOUND: The acting was actually pretty good, and everything about the sound seemed alive and real and it fit perfectly into the fights. Props to Sony for the fantastic sound quality.GAMEPLAY: I'm just going to get the bad stuff out of the way. Your worst enemy in the game is not the colossus creatures, but the damn camera. The battles can get pretty intense, and unfortunately because of the this, the camera can become schizophrenic and can go out of control at times, causing some problems during the epic battles. This game can be really tough, especially when trying to get to the weak points of the creatures, because you have to climb onto them, and most of the colossus creatures require a special act you must perform to be able to climb them. Wandering the environments can be confusing at times, the sword's reflecting power that shows you where to go helps, but it can still be confusing. Controlling Aggro could be a pain at times especially when trying to navigate him in tight spaces. Horse riding works well, but it takes some getting used to. Your primary weapons as mentioned before are a sword and a bow and arrow set. The bow and arrow is mostly used to get the attention of the colossus you are facing, and cause little damage. The sword is the primary tool to killing these creatures, but you have to be on these giant behemoths to do this. Each of the colossus creatures have nice fur patches you cling onto and climb up onto them to get to their weak points. In order to reach the fur, the game requires you to do things like make the colossus shatter pieces of its armor or tip it over and then climb on and stab away. You do this by hitting the weak points that are marked on the bosses. Each colossus is different, Sony lovingly designed the game so that no Colossus battle was the same and they were all different. Some are walking giants, others can fly, others can swim, and others can burrow underground. Also, the locations you fight the colossus creatures in are never the same as well, another highlight and obvious sign of loving care. This game really gives you a nice sense of what it would be like to fall from great heights as well, because your character can only hold on for so long before letting go. Fighting such creatures feels real and you get a good idea what it would be like to climb creatures that are several feet tall, fight creatures in mid-air, or fight them in water. Overall, the gameplay is fantastic, though it could use some tweaks to make it better.OVERALL: If you own a PS2, buy this awesome game, you won't regret it.THE GOOD: Great gameplay, fantastic creature designs, great environmental designs, good graphics, sublime music, and a unique and interesting storyline.THE BAD: Schizophrenic camera, tough gameplay, texture and lighting problems, the music isn't always there.",5,"A JAW-DROPPING, MESMERIZING MASTERPIECE  9.25 OUT OF 10",2008/12/23 0:00
A2LPJD19MGBNXJ,B0009I6S0O,"Adrian Jenkins southerndudeman""""",16,8,"...I don't really see what the big deal is. Having defeated 7 of the 16 colossi, I am still waiting to be drawn into this vast storyline I keep hearing about.Ahem, but I get ahead of myself. Shadow of the Colossus"" is certainly unlike most games I've ever played. You start as a...man (boy?) who is trying to resurrect a...woman (girl?). You journey to a forbidden land to speak with the Dormir (dormir is Latin for ""sleep"", by the way), who are...spirits(?) who can raise the dead. They propose a challenge - defeat 16 colossi roaming the land, in order to destory 16 idols in a vacant temple. And thus, your story begins. And...that's pretty much it, to this point. Each time you defeat a colossus, you return and hear...that you need to defeat another colossus. That's REALLY it (other than some poorly translated stuff at the beginning, said by some witch doctor, or possibly Majora's Mask).Let's begin with the good. ""Shadow"" has some of the best graphics ever to grace the PS2. In fact, they're a little TOO good - the PS2 can hardly handle the graphics stuffed into this one, and often skips some animation. This is a minor flaw, however, and the countryside is both vast and lush, with green forests, blue lakes, excellent shading for light and dark, etc. If you want to get a good idea of how great these graphics are, you need only observe the fine detail of your horse's tail. I mean, these graphics are incredible (for the PS2).As far as ideas go, this game has a good one. Rather than bore the player with the tedium of mindless monster encounters which do little but tire your thumbs and fingers, there are exactly 16 enemies in the game (not counting the optional lizards, which can't really be called enemies, anyway). And each battle is epic - the colossi each have weak points to be exploited, but it's up to the player to figure out how. Much of the time, a player will have to climb a colossus (who generally have fur/moss to grip) and stab it, but getting there is all the challenge. I love the battles in theory...However, in execution, there are numerous problems. The first is the horrible camera. Rarely does it move where you want. And while one CAN lock onto a colossus, I have found that often, it is detrimental to the player's chance of defeating the titan. Also, the character's running motion is incredibly awkward - one cannot easily run away from a colossus, out of the screen. This makes battles that SHOULD be easier much more complicated (although I haven't found any yet that are particularly challenging).Controls are gummy, particularly when controlling the horse.  Climbing colossi is more difficult than it should be because the character often gets hung up (you try to move sideways, but he wants to go up). The horse is a nightmare all around - his speed is controlled by spurring, but it is erratic, and he always slows even in a slight turn. This makes overworld travel rather painful.And that's a problem, too - while no overworld enemies saves a player from the boredom of fighting 100 green slimes, it unfortunately adds to the frustration when a colossus cannot be found. Riding on the horse will fray the nerves of many, and you'll be doing it a lot.The music? Not bad, but nothing special. And even if it WAS great, it is so sparse as to be forgettable despite its greatness. You will get music while fighting colossi (and it is helpful - a change in music usually means you're on the right path to defeating the giant), and a small theme each time you enter a colossus' realm, but that's it.And we end where we began. I have no doubt that this game has a great story - somewhere. Unfortunately, it has developed so slowly that most will give up before they see the payoff. I'll stick with it, because I enjoy the colossus battles, but it isn't surprising that some people don't see what the hub-bub is about. I surely don't...at the moment.All in all, an intriguing idea mixed with good gameplay, great graphics, mediocre control and zero story (at least through 7 colossi), and you pretty much have a dud.""",2,"I haven't completed the game, but...",2007/4/25 0:00
A1TY4TRLA4QK5Y,B0009I6S0O,"Brian Long Brian""""",2,2,"First off, most people probably won't like this game initially. People who play video games have gotten so inundated with FPS sloggers, RPG's where you have to fight 80 hojillion battles to make level 2, and trite storyline after trite storyline, that when your missing any of those elements, people for some reason think their missing a crucial aspect of the game.Thankfully, that period of ignorance should be blessedly short for most. The gorgeous, flowing world that changes almost seamlessly from desert to plain to forest will take the breath of even the hardest critic of VG graphics. The soft background music adds a nice touch as you gallop on horseback from one exotic locale to the next.Then there are the opponents themselves, which are awe-inspiring to say the least. While their defeat is has been described as formulaic (stab them in their weak point) how else would one fight a walking mountain? The colossi are each unique, with different movements and even personalities, which you can start to sense as you play. Some of the battles can be rather frustrating, but all of the paths forward are intuitive and can be figure out.The story is also beautiful. While it is a take on the normal save your loved one"" premise, it is delivered and handled expertly and originally. You don't even start off with a certain goal in mind, as the best you can hope for is that saving Mono (whom you bring into the game to bring back to life) ""may not be impossible.""Simply put, if you liked Ico, you'll love this game. If you come in looking for hack-n-slash, or a simple point and click story progression, you'll be sorely disappointed. This game is meant to be appreciated like a fine wine or a work of art, not ramroded through to kill several hours.""",5,One of the few pieces of gaming art ever made,2007/8/10 0:00
A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0009I6S0O,"Cloud ...""""",1,1,"Now unique not in the sense of weirdness(like Katamari) or in presentation(Killer 7) but rather the game focuses more on creating an emotion, an experience rather than just simply a case of fun"". Whereas predecessor Ico was built more around a puzzle elements with the occasional combat(taking down those shadows who have the nerve to try to steal Yorda), Shadow is built more like an action game with puzzle elements mixed in and it very much isn't exaggeration when the game contains some of the more intense and exhilating sequences in gaming.Story: The story's pretty sparse, giving you small details and letting you think up the rest. Essentially, the Wanderer and his faithful horse Argo are bringing a woman's body, Mono, to a shrine. Dead, unconcious, coma or trance, it's never said but apparently, an entity known as Dormin can bring her back to life. Only thing is is that roaming the land are 16 Colossi, massive creatures and upon defeating all 16, he will be granted the ability to revive her. Like Ico, the story isn't focused on specific details and while some might question the game's reluctance to specifically spell out your relationship with Mono, you really start to feel like saving her and she's not just your goal but something you have to actually accomplish for yourself. Sounds like too much but some do get this involved.Graphics: It's very similar to Ico where the light seems overexposed and very bright but it's not a game built for detail but more for an atmosphere. Sun-dried ravines and forests with sunlight filtered through the treetops lend the game a great ambience. The only thing is that there is some noticeable slowdown but it's not that big of a deal unless you focus on it. Then of course there's the colossi themselves and there's nothing like tilting the camera so that you can look up at these massive things and think ""I gotta bring this bugger down?"" The fur and detail in these creatures is quite impressive.Sound/Music: Hands-down one of the better soundtracks of that year. The music is very minimal, if at all, until you fight one of the 16 and the music gets very epic and Hollywood. Hope you got it hooked to a sound system since the music just makes the battles more epic and exciting with a full stereo going rather than cheap monoral TV speakers. Like Ico, the voice acting is a foreign language with subtitles provided (translated for a change). It does give the game a more richer history even if it sounds like gibberish.Gameplay: Each Colossi is a puzzle in and of itself. Some of them are pretty easy to figure out while others are like ""what the hell do you do?!"" then it hits you: ""ohh! THAT's what you do?""  One required me to swim to its back, climb up all the way to his head and direct him to go to one of 3 towers. Climbing on top of the tower, he then puts his front feet up, exposing the weak spot that was originally inaccessible since it was underwater. There's many more like this so don't get frustrated easily if you have no idea what to do. Of course knowing how and actually doing are 2 separate things and part of the frustration comes with those bad mistakes which send you careening off and hitting the ground hard. There's times where your character isn't as precise control-wise and jumping from here to there might actually send him in the wrong way and you'll plummet.Unlike other games where there was multiple control schemes for everything, controlling the Wanderer is pretty basic. He's got 2 weapons, bow and arrow and his sword. Point the sword in a sun-lit area and move around, eventually the light becomes a line, pointing you towards the next Colossi but it doesn't give you a map on how to get there like passing through cliffsides, paths and forests but just tells you ""he's this way, now go find him"". Climbing has a Grip Meter which you can strengthen by finding lizards with silver tails. It's easy enough to control and I even did a movie-esque save where I grabbed a patch of fur at the last minute but there's times where the colossi will shake so much and the Wanderer is so sensitive that even slight shakes will make him hang on for dear life rather than climbing.While it's the spiritual successor, you can't really say Shadow of the Colossus is better than Ico since ultimately, you play it 2 completely different ways but track down both but Shadow is definately an experience to check out.""",5,One of the most unique games on the PS2,2005/10/27 0:00

Shadow of the Colossus is simply one of the most amazing and astounding games to ever be released for the system.  The first thing you'll notice is the game's astonishing visuals, which are the best to ever be seen on the PS2.  The landscapes are beautifuly rendered and the environments are lush and organic.  Oh yeah, then there's the colossi.  Throughout the game, your mission is to vanquish 16 different mythical, and gigantic, beasts that hold the key to saving your seemingly lost love.  And when I say gigantic, I mean gigantic; the colossi are the biggest bosses you'll EVER see in a video game, including some that are as tall as a skyscraper.  The storyline appears simple at first, but as the game unfolds, it becomes something much more, and saying more would be saying too much.  At it's heart, Shadow of the Colossus does follow the typical aspects of an action/adventure game, but the frantic and awe-inspiring battles with the massive bosses make this game a sight to behold.  The controls can be a bit touchy, but once you get used to them you'll be fine, while there are some technical issues with the otherwise incredible graphics, but nothing that deters away from the overall epic feel of the game.

There is a great synergy (stupid word, I know, but descriptive in this case) between the launch games and the system, something which cannot be said for the bloated PS3.

The motion controller and nun-chuck was an innovative idea that attracted customers who had only ever been used to standard control pads. But with the release ofPlayStation Move Starter BundleandKinect Sensor with Kinect Adventures and Gunstringer Token Codethe Wii has lost its unique edge, and since it never offered anything like the PlayStation Trophies or Xbox Achievements the online features are limited to those stupid 'Miis' and the rather dull Wii Store.The console itself is sturdy but small, and feels more like a toy than something that belongs connected to your home entertainment system, thus making it more likely to be kept in a kid's bedroom. There is no separate audio out and the video connection is, at best, RGB. It has the ability to play GameCube games, which is a huge bonus as there are a lot of hidden gems out there for that system, but they are region-locked, so you can't import otherwise unavailable games from the other countries, ditto for the Wii games themselves. None of the downloadable features are really any good. If I want to load pictures onto a games console the PS3 is more appropriate, plus it also features the ability to save audio and video files, which the Wii doesn't. One of the better features is the aforementioned Wii store, which offers retro Nintendo and Sega games. But they hardly ever update it and the payment system feels like a con.I really do feel that the reign of the Wii is over. It's a Remora fish swimming in the wake of the bigger consoles. If you're going to invest in something for your kids or for your home theater then leave this be. It's great for a toy if you pick it up cheap, though it will never be a 'main' Xmas or birthday present again.

At only $250, it provides motion sensing controllers which are great fun - and 480p graphics which aren't as good as our other two systems.The Wii is designed around a menu of channels"". These make it very easy for even a non-gamer to start using the console quickly. There is of course the game-playing channel, where the Wii will play any Wii or GameCube game. Simply load the disc in and go - it's a simple front-loading ""slot"", no carriage to break. There is a Mii channel where you set up a profile and avatar to connect to all your game playing, with many cute options. You can even make your Mii thin or thick. The Photos channel lets you look at photos on your TV, although its loading options are limited. Other channels for news, weather, and online shopping require an interent connection, and at least at launch aren't available yet.The system does NOT have a regular network cable port, which both the PS3 and XBox 360 have. Instead, it works with built in wireless or with a USB network adapter. I am a firm proponent of wireless - less clutter! So I am thrilled that they offer wireless automatically. With the PS3, you have to pay the extra $100 for the 60 gig unit to get this built in. The XBox 360 doesn't have it at all. We had our wireless up and running in about 5 minutes.It's hard to generalize gameplay on any console - it really depends on what games you buy. That being said, the comes-with-it software of Sports is really quite fun to play and is about as basic as you can get. We've had 8 year olds and adults try it out and really enjoy it. You swing at baseballs, lob tennis balls, bowl, box and play golf. A ""fitness"" mode puts you through a variety of tasks and then calculates your fitness age, sort of like how Brain Age keeps track of your mental age. If you did both every day, you could aim to be as fit mentally and physically as possible!In a world where video games = couch potato, it really is quite amazing to have a game where it natively expects you to move and be active. You don't lounge back and gain pounds here while playing games. Boxing can be quite strenuous, jabbing, blocking and weaving in real life. Tennis involves quick reflexes and strong arm movements. Bowling might be the most relaxed of the sports, but even there you are standing, moving, swinging. You get your heart going at least a little, and get some exercise. My boyfriend found his arms were sore after a few hours of fun gaming.The 480p resolution is certainly not high def 1080p like our other two systems. It's something you accept when you're paying such a low price for the console. But really, it's not that big a deal. I still play the old Zeldas and love them for their gameplay, even though you can't see the pores in Link's face. If they are going for the cartooney characters and environments, 480p is DVD quality and is quite good. If you really, really crave high definition super realism in your games, then the Wii might not be the best choice for you. However, if you're fine with playing games with a more impressionist / cartooney look to them, the 480p can show that quite nicely. For example, in Wii baseball, there aren't fans in the bleachers - just colored blocks.Nintendo has always been known as a ""Kid's Console"" - but I really do think with the Wii that they have become a ""Family Console"". It's not just kids who will enjoy this. Seniors can have fun bowling without knowing anything ""Tricky"" about how to use a video game unit. It's very intuitive. Moms can easily play with their kids, each with their own Wii profile. Adults having parties can have fun passing the controllers around. Family groups can share slideshows on the big screen while hanging out and drinking wine.With the price tag being so low, a gaming household that ""needs"" a higher end system can easily save up their money to get that XBox 360 or PS3 - and still be able to justify the $250 to get a Wii for the fun, casual gaming stuff to share with their non-gaming friends.Well recommended!

Although they have had a very strong lineup with the Gamecube including Super Smash Brothers Melee, The Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and Super Mario Sunshine, many people seemed to really be more interested in the Playstation 2 and Xbox. Nevertheless, the company needed to find a new way for gamers to play all sorts of great games. That definitely hits well with the Nintendo Wii. Since the hype grew back last year with the new methods we can play video games, can this new system can redefine video games at home forever? The answer is really YES!!!The Nintendo Wii game system is a new system that really changes the way we play video games. The gameplay on this system is all featured on a wireless remote which you can use your body to move your characters around in new ways. The system comes with a wired remote, a nunchuck analog controller attachment, and has a internal memory where you can store all your video game data. The system does include Wii Sports, which is a fantastic mini-game compilation that warms you up to the new ways you can play baseball from swinging the controller like a bat and a racket to play tennis, to a simple pair of boxing gloves in Boxing that you can use to knockout opponents. The remote also works great for games like Excite Truck, that you can use as a steering wheel to drive your car, or a fishing rod to catch reekfish in The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess.The compatability with the system also works great for Gamecube owners as well. You can also play your classic Gamecube games on this system like Mario Kart: Double Dash, and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. All you need to do is simply plug your gamecube controllers into the specialty port, and you can play all those great games Gamecube lovers know and love. The only disadvantage with this is that you can't turn the system off with the Wii remote whenever you play a gamecube game. Instead, you have to turn it off from the main console itself, whcih isn't a big problem. You also can download a whole deal of great classic games from Nintendo's past into the virtual console, and play wonderful games like Super Mario 64 from the Nintendo 64 system, and The Legend Of Zelda from the NES era. You can also download great games from other classic consoles, including the Sega Genesis and Turbographx 16. You can play classic games like Sonic The Hedgehog and Bonk's Revenge that you download from the Wii's online shop, and just play away.While other systems like the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 are more about the hype and cost more bang for your bucks, the Nintendo Wii really does deliver in a fantastic system that does deliver in changing not just the way we play video games, but keeps the fun alive for everyone young and old alike. Although I had a tough time trying to find the system, it is really worth the purchase.

Upcoming titles like Super Mario Galaxy and the next installment in the Metroid Prime series, make purchasing the Wii all the sweeter, and the ultra affordable price should help seal the deal.

The console has a wireless network for it to go online for updates or to shop at the nintendo wii virtual store if you have a computer most people realize you have to give the console an IP address as well as Default Gateway and Subnet Mask especially if you have multi-computers networked to you're modem. I myself first tried to have the console find these addresses automatically but ended up having to do it manually especially for the IP address.  After that was taking care of though it found the updates easily and I was also able to shop online at the wii virtual store.  The console allows you to play you're gamecube games as well and you can play the old nintendo,super nintendo,sega genesis,or nintendo 64 games you downloaded from the virtual store.  The wii plays great and I have already gotten such greatgames such as Super Mario Party 8,Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess,and Harry Potter and the Order Of The Phoenix  the games play great and they read the remote and nun chuck controls excellently.

E Jackson,0,0,"My biggest problem with Dawn of Sorrow is that it wants to be Symphony of the Night *so bad* that it actually ends up missing the mark by quite a bit.First of all, there's an assortment of problems with this game.  I grew up with Symphony of the Night from the Playstation 1 and let me tell ya- THAT game is an absolute masterpiece in every way imaginable.  Back when it came out, everyone knew there was something incredibly special about it.  Symphony of the Night is the kind of game that only comes along once in a blue moon.  The kind of game that does just about everything right, making it extremely hard (almost impossible) for the Castlevania series to ever reach that kind of greatness ever again.Keeping Symphony of the Night in my thoughts the entire time I was playing through Dawn of Sorrow, this game had major expectations, most of which fell short, BUT not enough of a fall for me to claim Dawn of Sorrow is a complete failure.  Nope, not at all.I personally have a major problem with the countless amounts of text you have to witness in the beginning of the game.  I mean LOTS and LOTS of text.  One of the main reasons Symphony of the Night was such a charming game is because you didn't have to read through all kinds of unnecessary text- you simply jump right into the game and play it.  Konami made sure SOTN was playable for everyone, Castlevania fans or otherwise.It's not that the story in Dawn of Sorrow is bad and all that text reading is boring as a result, it's just that, Symphony of the Night was able to become a timeless classic without having to rely on the player reading text upon text, so Dawn of Sorrow misses the mark there and HAS to be seen as somewhat of a disappointment in comparison.  If this game is supposed to be a combination of RPG and action elements similar to the Zelda series, well once again, Symphony of the Night was able to do it better.Also, the enemies in this game are pretty much nothing but the *same exact enemies* we'd already seen and loved in Symphony of the Night.  I fail to see why we have to deal with exact replicas of the same enemies once again.How can it be possible to carry the same kind of excitement in a sequel when all we're doing is fighting the same enemies all over again?  We shouldn't have to- Konami should have found some developers who were willing to lend their creative ideas for more variety in the enemy department.  Folks, I kid you not-  most of the enemies in Dawn of Sorrow can be found in Symphony of the Night doing their same routine once again.  Those skeletons that throw flame barrels?  Well they're all OVER the place here.  I can pretty much run down a list of enemies in both games and conclude there's just way too many of them in this game that simply don't belong.  When you first encountered these same enemies in Symphony of the Night, it was truly an incredible experience because you've never seen anything like them before.  Dawn of Sorrow has that been there done that"" vibe mostly because of the enemies, but also because of the gameplay.Which leads us to the next problem- the animation of the enemy movements (and the way they die) aren't nearly as good as the ones in Symphony of the Night.  Everything moved in such a fluid and near-perfect way in Symphony of the Night, but unfortunately this game comes up way way short thanks to some unnecessary choppiness in the animations.  Watching enemies die isn't nearly as thrilling either.The gameplay is NOT as much fun this time around since we're dealing with the same enemies and movements once again.  I don't know what went wrong.  If anything, now it feels like we're playing a cheaper or watered down version of Symphony of the Night.  Unacceptable.The weapons are alright, but they aren't animated as nicely as the sword swings from Symphony of the Night.  I feel a bit of choppiness in each swing that makes the game feel tacky most of the time.  Also each weapon really stood apart in Symphony of the Night (except for a few swords here and there) but in this game, most of the weapons blend together and there's hardly any truly memorable ones.The areas themselves aren't that great to explore either- one place has these square rooms and number puzzles that end up being a nightmare of confusion and annoyances, something Symphony of the Night avoided entirely.The boss fights are a LOT worse than the ones in Symphony of the Night.  These ones are almost terrible in comparison.  Just swing at them as quickly as you can with your sword until they die.  No strategy or anything involved, and especially no creativity as far as dodging boss attacks are concerned.  Completely uncreative.  The bosses don't really feel like much of a fight either because most of them have only a couple attacks and that's it.  Play Symphony of the Night for a solid year and you'll STILL be surprised when a boss throws a new attack at you that you haven't seen before.With all these complains, the game DOES do one thing right- the game is loaded with action.  Lots and lots of action, at almost every single turn.  Perhaps even slightly more than Symphony of the Night.Unfortunately, this game comes up way short compared to Symphony of the Night.  Dawn of Sorrow doesn't have the crisp graphics, fluid animations, incredible weapon variety, or incredible soundtrack that SOTN had (though the music IS quite catchy in this game I admit).In addition to these problems, Dawn of Sorrow seriously feels like playing as Zero from the Mega Man X series thanks to the way the main character spins around and slashes at enemies with his sword.  It's TOO reminiscent of Zero from the X series.  Plus the anime style graphics were a bad idea.  It's been done a thousand times, and it doesn't belong in Castlevania.  Just not a classic game in my mind, but if we ignore many of the problems and focus on all the action (and of course ignore the fact Symphony of the Night completely smears it) this is a pretty good game despite its many flaws.""",5,more Castlevania,2006/11/11 0:00
A36UKFV79879MD,B0009Z3K9E,BX Lounger,2,2,"Just like the Game Boy Advance saw three Castlevania games throughout its life cycle, the Nintendo DS bore witness to a whole new trilogy of Castlevania games. It began with this game, Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow released in 2005.For many Castlevania fans, it was the tried and true formula with new game play twists and 2 player Vs. support rolled into one excellent experience. If you were never a fan of Castlevania or prefer the old school experience over the Metroid-vania"" layouts and leveling up of character that has been a staple since Symphony of the Night, you won't like this game one bit. But for the rest of us, this game started a new trilogy for the DS and it's a good thing.The story is short and sweet this time: You control Soma Cruz, a young man who possess the spirit of Dracula. As soon as he realizes this, a cult is on the hunt for him to release the spirit to resurrect Dracula. Thus, you start out in front of a huge castle to explore. Along the way, you can collect a variety of weapons, accessories and souls. The souls can be combined for special attacks and abilities to help you on your quest. Just like the previous games, your character can level up and become stronger. Beat the game and you unlock bonus content/modes alongside the story mode, wireless mode and options. Save your progress anytime you walk into a room marked red on the map.The PROS: Konami did not mess with the formula as much and it plays exactly like the GBA Castlevania games. With the DS, you can look at the map or status screen on the top screen while the action takes place on the bottom screen and with new hardware comes with the graphical and audio upgrades. It looks, sounds and plays great so you will feel right at home. While you don't use the touch screen aspect too much, you now have to draw ""seals"" on the screen every time you are about to defeat a boss and on certain sections of the game, you need the stylus to clear the way for you. Beating the game opens up new modes and a so there is some incentive to go above and beyond.The CONS: Since it's the first Castlevania game to grace the DS, there isn't much they added that takes advantage of the DS other than the limited use of the stylus. When it comes to drawing the correct seal before the boss is defeated, the boss fight continues if you don't draw the correct seal and it gains some health. Thankfully, there is a mode during the game where you can practice how to draw the seals that you uncover. Also, there is no online connectivity because the game came out shortly after the DS made its debut. The Wi Fi Connection service hasn't been set up yet but the later games in the series took advantage of it.It's a great start for the trilogy of Castlevania DS games and while it doesn't add a lot of new things to the gam, it's still fun to play and just warms you up for the next two games to follow. You can get this used if money is an issue for you and if you're a fan of the series, especially from the GBA days, give this one a try if you haven't done so already.""",4,A whole new trilogy begins with this excellent DS game,2011/8/15 0:00
A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B0009Z3K9E,"Christopher Barrett Evil Corgi""""",1,1,"I remember playing the original Castlevania when I was younger (around age 10 or 11), and I always remember how punishingly difficult the game seemed.  Years later I played the game on an emulator and was surprised that it was still pretty punishingly difficult.  But the old Castlevania games (1 - 4) really upped the challenge with ledges and pits that if you fell off you died.  Occasionally there would be a touch enemy or tough boss, but really the pain was in timing jumps and such.  Especially with flying Medusa heads coming at you!So the latest Castlevania games have a different style of play and difficulty.  Instead of the finite lives and continues (as in 1, 3, and 4), the games have a save feature.  You grow your character by gathering experience slaying demons.  Since there are very few 'bottomless pits' to die in (or none at all!), the challenge is focused on battling demons and bosses.So the challenge is not as high as previous games, but not as frustrating as those earlier versions.Now onto this game!  I played this for the first time recently, after completing Order of Ecclesia, and after playing a bit of Portrait of Ruin.  I didn't play the previous Game Boy Advance titles.  But comparing this to the other 2-d Castlevania titles, I would place this in the top three.I still rate Symphony of the Night and Order of Ecclesia higher, but Dawn of Sorrow could make a case for being ranked in the top, though the amazing glyph system of Ecclesia pretty much locks it in at #1 in my opinion.In this version you have a very good story, with some interesting characters.  The story continues from the previous game (which I didn't play), but they do a pretty good job of summing up the events of the previous game.Most of the game is spent trying to just 'beat the game'.  As opposed to Ecclesia with all of the various side quests, most of the time in this game will be spent advancing farther into Dracula's Castle while backtracking to gather the occasional item that was previously unattainable without a new ability.  You might also backtrack to fight demons to gain souls.And that takes me to the point here.  If I hadn't played Ecclesia first, I would have been very pleased with the soul gathering aspect.  You gather souls to learn abilities, the more of each soul, the higher the level of the ability.  You can also use souls to upgrade weapons in town.  Though the upgrades are basically the next stronger item, which is usually available for purchase at the weapon shop next door, though at a steep price.  Some of the abilities take MP, like bone toss or using Lightning, and others are static abilities.  It's pretty fun to customize Soma, and you eventually find an item to allow you to set his abilities and equipment into two slots and quick change them with the X button.  But again, Ecclesia's glyph system was near flawless, so I can't really say I love the soul system.  (You can read my Ecclesia review for more info).The challenge is decent, though not as tough as Ecclesia.  The reason is that most boss battles are pretty easy to figure out.  And often the boss will hesitate and allow you to just start ripping multiple hits on them.  Later bosses get more challenging of course, but the early bosses in Ecclesia were as tough as some of the middle bosses in this game.  I remember dying three times fighting Malphas (bird lady), twice fighting Dario, and once fighting Balore (big fist guy early on).  But that's nothing compared to dying 10 times trying to figure out the first boss in Ecclesia!Pros:+ Very large area to explore.+ Wide variety of weapons and armor.+ Great music and sound effects.+ Decent challenge.+ Very good DS graphics.Cons:- Soul system good, but not perfect.- 99% of the game is in one of two areas, no wilderness areas (like Ecclesia).- Only two quick set options for abilities (could have used a third).- Not a lot of hidden items/chests.- Having to use the stylus to 'seal' boss monsters.  It's pretty lame...The reason I compare this to Ecclesia is because many other players might be looking to buy one of these two games, since they are both on the DS, and both very well made.  I recommend playing through this one first, just because going back to this game after Ecclesia is bittersweet.  You know how good it is, but you can't help thinking of the improvements and tougher challenge of Ecclesia while playing this.  Granted, Ecclesia was made 4 years later.",5,This made a long time Castlevania fan very happy!,2012/2/10 0:00

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B0009Z3K9E,S. Rhodes,6,4,"If you loved Castlevania Aria of Sorrow, then it should be made a national law that you must pick up this game!  It takes off a year from where the former one ended, but it has been upgraded for the better, and unlike most other DS games, actually utilizes the touch screen to it's full advantage.Soma Cruz, from Aria of Sorrow, has been keeping his power of Dracula sustained for a year now.  When having a friendly chat with Mina, he is suddenly attacked by a derranged woman named Celia Fortner, a member of a cult that seeks to unleash Dracula's power and the only way she and her cult can be successful is by taking down Soma Cruz.  A fairly basic plot, but it has it's surprises.This is a pretty standard Castlevania game.  You control Soma, using his abilities and several weapons to take on the forces of evil in a sadistic village hideout where this cult resides.  As you go through you'll find new weapons, collect more souls and rise above your enemies.You'll start off with basic items and weapons.  Throughout each area Soma can use weapons such as a sword, a mace, a spear and plenty other to thwart his enemies.  Like Aria of Sorrow, Soma can absorb different souls from enemies.  Each soul has it's own priority.  Souls are also divided into four categories: Bullet, Guardian, Enchant and Ability.Bullet Souls are the souls which you'll use to vanquish your enemies.  They're your offensive souls, mainly.  Guardian Souls are souls Soma will use to transform into monsters and summon other monster.  Enchanted souls are souls that automatically take effect without you having to use them, such as increasing your strength and giving you the ability to absorb HP from other monsters.  And the ability souls are the souls Soma will HAVE to use in order to accomplish certain task. Each time Soma uses a soul he'll consume MP.  Like all Castlevania games (with the exception of Lament of Innocnce) your MP automatically restores itself over time.The really great thing about the DS is how the dual screens are used.  The game is played entirely on the touch screen.  The top screen displays the map at all times (something that makes the game flow A LOT faster), while you make all your movements on the bottom screen.  Along the way you'll obtain Magic Seals.  When activiated a shape is drawn on screen and you are to draw that shape as shown in order to unlock certain doors, and vanquish boss enemies.  Needless to say, you'll actually need your stylus in order to fully experience the game.  Not only that but in certain rooms you'll have to destroy crystals, this also requires the use of the stylus.As Soma defeats enemies he'll gain money and also level up.  Much like your classic action/adventure RPG.  Each time Soma levels up he'll need more and more experience.  He'll need to use money to buy more weapons, healing potions and other items needed along his journey.  However, it may not always be best to buy weapons.  Soma can synthesize weapons using souls.  In other words, if you have too many of a certain soul, you can use it to customize and create better weapons.Another really great trick is if you have Aria of Sorrow.  Before booting up your DS, put Aria of Sorrow in the GBA slot, and put Dawn of Souls in and start up your game.  Starting a new game with Aria of Sorrow inserted nets you extra items at the beginning of your journey and more story points.Graphically there is perhaps no better looking side-scroller Castlevania.  The movements are smooth, and the color is vibrant.  Each enemy moves at consistent rate, and there's hardly any slow down.Likewise, the music is incredible!  Castlevania doesn't usually disappoint with music, and Dawn of Sorrow is no different.  The music always fits with an area, and is powerful.  Soma's voice acting is also great.  Each time Soma swings a weapon, or sometimes when he jumps, he'll make a grunt or something.  It isn't overused (like in say... Super Mario Advanced) and it's the same voice used in Aria of Sorrow.The game doesn't present too much difficulty.  It starts off easy and gets increasingly harder.  Just what you'd expect from any game.  At some parts it is perhaps too easy, but we can deal.It was worth the wait for this game.  It plays smoothly, and finishes with incredible awe.  It's full of secrets and has a ton of replay value.  Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow does not disappoint.  Every Castlevania fan should get it.",5,The DS Game Everyone Should Own!,2005/10/13 0:00

I've played every Mario Kart game since the Super Nintendo version, and I must say that this is most definitely, in every single way, the best of them all. Here is my review.Graphics: 9/10. Smooth framerate ( somewhat choppy in WiFi mode ) in single player, great animations, nice looking tracks... this is a really good looking game, but they are not as good as they could have been. The graphics could have been cleaned up, and the game is somewhat glitchy. If you snake"" around a corner and almost hit the wall, you can see through it. It's nothing bad, just something to take note about.Sound: 9/10. Everything Mario. The karts sound good, the voices for the most part sound really nice ( except for DK and Bowser; it seems like some really bad impersonator tried to do their voices. ). The music is also really good... then again, what in this game isn't?Control: 8.5/10. It takes time to master ""snaking"", but once you get the hang of it, you will be king of the track every single game. The controls are very simple if you don't include using the ""snake"" button; all you have to do is drive... that's really it.Fun: 9.5/10. 8 player local, 4 player WiFi, 4 unlockable characters, 16 new tracks along with 16 classics, 36 selectable karts... this game has got it all. A downfall for this game though is definitely the blue shells. I constantly will find myself on the third lap about to cross the finish line, get hit by one, and get into second or third. It doesn't matter though; THIS IS THE BEST DS GAME OUT THERE RIGHT NOW.

Not once have I bought a game that wasn't fun, addictive or deep in gameplay. Sadly, I hate to admit, I can't say that with the Playstation Portable. Sure, some games were flawed(course, all games have flaws of some sort). And, sure, the graphics aren't of PSP calibur but who really cares when the games are this good.

Most of them won't be availible until you complete other races, but that's the fun of Mario Kart.  The races are not too hard, and they're a load of fun!  Four of these tracks are brand new, but several are taken from previous Mario Kart titles.  From the SNES, to the GBA release just a couple of years ago. You can enter cups at 50cc, 100cc, or 150cc.  This, of course, is the difficulty level.  You'll not only notice your opponents get faster, but they'll get more aggressive as well.There are eight characters with two vehciles each.  Well, at first.  As you progress through the game you'll unlock more.  When deciding on a character you of course are looking at speed, acceleration, etc. but you may also want to look at things like... the drifting... or their item attribute.  A low item attribute will often net you items that are pretty much useless.This is NOT just a rehash of an old game, though.  I noted that there are four new tracks, and that it actually combines earlier titles.  But there are also new powerups in this one.  You now have a Bullet Bill power up which will increase your speed (and send you temporarily into auto-pilot).  You'll also be able to fire off a Bob-omb (that'll really mess your opponents up) and you can now release a blooper (those squid guys) to squirt ink on the screen of your opponents.  These new editions are worth it.In addition to the new power ups and tracks, you've also got Mission"" mode.  This will pit you into courses where you'll have to perform certain task to move on.  For example, you may need to pass through gates in a certain order.  There are six groups with nine levels each.  Each group ending with a boss.Now let's move on to the best stuff.

Sure, that's not a lot, and the track selection is somewhat limited here, but just being able to actually play with people from across the world in the comfort of your home is incredibly appealing.Internet aside, there's still much more to enjoy here. The tracks here are as robust and colorful as ever! I mean, seriously. You can't possibly go wrong when it comes to racing through the likes of a giant pinball machine, or Luigi's very spooky mansion. Plus, Nintendo has also managed to revive a whole lot of tracks from previous Mario Kart games, including favorites like Double Dash's Baby Park, Super Circuit's Sky Garden, and MK64's Moo Moo Farm.The Battle mode is VERY lively here compared to other games! Here, you can actually play alone and battle 7 computer players, teams or not! Multiplayer is also a very nice option here, as well (Too bad only Local, though). Whether you're popping each other's balloons with items or stealing each other's Shine Sprites, there's surely some fun to be had.Here's a thought: Ever wanted to more than just race and battle with these karts? Well, Mario Kart DS introduces a new mode in which you complete MISSIONS to progress through (Sadly, this isn't in Mario Kart Wii or 3DS)! The missions give off even more variety, as if the regular tracks didn't offer that much, by giving you challenging tasks to do. There's also Boss Battling, as you must defeat bosses that try to literally attack you, popping the balloons you have. I bet you'd be at this for a while.Overall, Mario Kart DS has a unique value to it that other games don't really have. It is just as good as many of the other Mario Karts, and I totally recommend it for all Nintendo fans.",5,The best handheld Mario Kart,2012/1/1 0:00
A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B000B69E9G,,1,0,"This game is the main reason I purchased a PS2, and I'm damn well glad I purchased the system for this thrilling masterpiece. Before RE4, I struggled with the past numbered entries. I enjoyed them, but they were frustrating as hell. RE1: Why are there so many locked doors?! Why can't fight off a zombie when he tries to eat me? Ugh... SO MUCH CRAP TO FIND! RE2: Who the hell builds a police station like this?! There shouldn't be this many locked doors and passageways in a police station! Damn you lickers and zombie dogs! RE3: Ahhh!! GO AWAY NEMESIS, GO AWAY! Run Jill Valentine run, you slow b**ch! DAMMIT! I'm dead from a f***ing rocket launcher... FANTASTIC. But RE4 completely rebuilt the franchise from scratch and gave it new life. If you didn't play RE4 solely for the fact you had many troubles with the past entries. Worry not, this entry has eased the difficulty by miles and it's paced far better than the past entries. This means those long moments of nothing are pretty much eliminated.WHAT THE GAME IS: This game is a mix between survival-horror and third-person shooter, though it feels more like a third-person shooter. Leon Kennedy (The guy from RE2 and he had a brief role in Gaiden) has been sent on a mission to rescue the President's kidnapped daughter; Ashley Graham; in an obscure part of what appears to be Spain. During his mission there, the villagers attack and attempt to kill Leon. It also turns out these villagers are infected with something. These guys aren't the rotting corpses you remember from the old RE games, these guys are meaner and more deadly. He must find the source of the outbreak and look for the secrets surrounding a mysterious organization that operates there.GRAPHICS: Who said PS2 visuals are bad? This game looks great and even looks better than some of my Xbox 360 games. Overall, the visuals look great and really know how to milk the PS2 hardware for what it's worth.MUSIC: There is little present most of the time, something I miss from the old RE games because there was always some kind of creepy music in the background. It comes up at key moments but is sadly absent most of the time.SOUND: Shooting, dying screams, chainsaws, and exploding heads.GAMEPLAY: This game introduced the over-the-shoulder camera which works quite well when shooting. The shooting mechanics work well and use the same button layout as the past RE games (R1 to aim, X to fire). You  get to shoot lots of zombies, and ammo is far more plentiful than most likely all the other RE games combined. There is a great selection of weapons to buy or find like guns, rocket launchers, and grenades. There are a bunch of other items to buy in the game as well. This game also has an upgrades system in which for a fee of some sort you can have your weapons upgraded to enlarge fire power and how much ammo a weapon can carry. But be warned the item compression system from the old RE games is still here, meaning you can only carry a certain number of items. This item compression system is at least far better than the old ones, allowing you to carry a large number of items before running out of room. You can also buy another box if you find your current one too small. This game also has a lot more health recovering items as well. You can even shoot fish and eat them along with chicken eggs to heal you. This game's main focus; shooting; works very well and the targeting system is among the most reliable I've ever used in a game. This game has great boss battles that are carefully balanced and heart-racing. This game relies on some timed button press scenes like the boulder scene or dodging some other large object that's coming at you. One part of the game I found rather surprising was the escort mission. All gamers pretty much hate escort missions because the person you're protecting is annoying and you'd rather see them die than let them live because it would just be a burden. Not in this game. The escort mission wasn't tedious or frustrating at all, and it was quite nice for a change to protect someone who isn't annoying as hell. Puzzles are cleverly devised in this game, and can be real brain-teasers at times and they weren't boring to solve. Every part of the gameplay is polished to perfection and can't really think of a way to knock off points against it. GO BUY THIS GAME NOW.OVERALL: This game is a superb and phenomenal and the gameplay is perfect.THE GOOD: Perfect gameplay, lots of guns, lots of zombies, lots of ammo, lots of health recovery, great story, an escort mission that doesn't suck, it's thrilling, good boss battles, great characters, and great graphics.THE BAD: The lack of music is the only thing that's wrong with this game.",5,A PHENOMENAL AND MIND-BLOWING GAME  10 OUT OF 10,2008/10/4 0:00

A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B000B69E9G,blackaciddevil,1,1,"Resident Evil has seen many highs and lows in the years since its' debut on the Playstation in 1996. I, personally, lost interest in the series after RE3:Nemesis. While I played RE: Code Veronica X, it just seemed to me it was the same ol' same ol' all over again. So, I went with Silent Hill for awhile because of its' fresh approach to survival horror. Sadly, it, too, began to regurgitate the same ol' formula with it's PS2 games so I gave up on games of this nature altogether. So, recently, my nephew comes over to play videogames with me and brings his copy of Resident Evil 4. Leaving it behind when he leaves to go home, I find it and decide to take a look at the game. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised when I got sucked into the game and played for hours on end. See, with this installment of Resident Evil, the series goes into a bold new direction with a greater emphasis on the story. If you're wondering how, all I can say is to check it out.The story itself has Leon Kennedy(whom RE Vets will remember from RE2) searching for the President's daughter in a remote European village where she was supposedly spotted. Yet, instead of facing zombies like in previous Resident Evil games, Leon faces a threat far greater than that. A threat that is genuinely creepy and very unsettling.While many of you know this game was originally released on the Nintendo Gamecube, it was successfully ported over to the Playstation 2 with several new extras(such as Ada Wong's Separate Ways sidestory, new outfits & whatnot). Very little was sacrificed in the making of this game and it shows. The game looks absolutely stunning(measuring up to the graphical style of Silent Hill and then some) and the gameplay is as perfect as it can be. Resident Evil 4 is a fine return to form as the leading Survival Horror game on the Playstation 2. I highly recommend you play this game.For me, I'm gone....out to buy Resident Evil 4. Later you all.",5,Resident Evil 4... A Fine Return to Form......,2007/8/16 0:00
A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000B69E9G,"Cloud ...""""",4,3,"I did play Resident Evil 4 on the GC but I never bought it. Then it got ported to the PS2 so I thought hey why not? The game is good regardless so whether you're playing the GC or this version it's still an awesome game regardless. I wouldn't go as far as saying it's the best game this generation but still.Story: It's a port so it's directly the same but unless you don't know the story I'll fill you in. There's no Umbrella or zombies in this, it's something else entirely. 6 years after Raccoon City got nuked because of the viral outbreak, former rookie officer Leon Kennedy has been assigned a quite important task: protect the President's family. Only Ashley, the daughter, gets kidnapped and spotted in Europe so Leon's on his way only to find that there's something up(of course).Graphics: It's been roughly 9 months since I played the GC version so I can't exactly tell there is a drop but it's not as polished/detailed as the old one but still it's still great graphics. The thing oozes with atmosphere, exploding heads still look great and the back corners of europe look unsettling.Sound/Music: Sound effects and whatnot is excellent. Shotgun blasts definately sound powerful here. Creatures have that unearthly quality while your main enemy here(they're called Ganados but I'm not spoiling what they are) speak spanish and they repeat themselves a bit too much. As for music, it's more ambient than anything, no catchy themes or anything here. But as usual the music really unsettles you to the point where you know something's going to happen but nobody's telling you anything.Gameplay: Nothing's really changed except for 2 new weapons, a new mode featuring, umm, a RE veteran. Detractors of previous RE's(such as myself) couldn't get past one thing: the control scheme. Essentially it was like you drove a tank, regardless of where you were pointing, up was always forward rather than it being 3D controls. This made precious ammo wasted since you couldn't see if you were actually getting anywhere. Well first there's several overhauls: camera is now Splinter Cell-like with a not-quite third person camera. This makes maneuvering and aiming a hell of a lot better. The control setup is still the same but because of the camera perspective it's not as bothersome.There's also plenty of ammo so you're not blindly firing shots. Some might find there's too much ammo actually. I literally had to rearrange my inventory to make it fit. The other overhaul is that in previous RE's, you needed an ink ribbon to save so no ink ribbon, no save. This was quite a problem when you went an hour without saving then bleeh, dead. Another overhaul is that in the old ones, there was a magic box where you stored weapons, ribbons, ammo and such. This connected to others so you never had to go to one such box to get one ammo, a box right next to you would have it. Well not so here because Leon carries an attache case so you get a portable briefcase with customization for it to fit more stuff since guns tend to take up space(with a rocket launcher taking up a good 20 spaces or so.If there's one thing that hasn't changed is the dialogue/voice overs. There just as B-movie as ever. It's hard not to cringe/laugh at lines like you're right hand comes off?"" when he meant a villain's sidekick is rather sad. Voice acting also isn't the best. Hearing Ashley go ""Leon!"" several times isn't that good for sanity. However it's Resident Evil and you don't play it for Metal Gear Solid voice caliber.The big attraction is Separate Ways, where you play Ada Wong for 5 chapters with a certain goal. They're really quick and I beat all 5 in about 2 and a half hours but mainly it's for fun. For example, why did the church bell ring in the prologue? Or how Ada managed to save Leon from a certain death? It's all here. One thing that sucked is the inventory was extremely limited to at least 4 guns or so and you couldn't even upgrade the stupid things.You should judge the game on the game itself rather than what Capcom did wrong going from Gamecube to PS2 so if you don't judge it, you'll find an excellent game underneath.""",5,Judge the game on the game and you'll find what a game it is,2005/10/28 0:00

The first thing you'll notice is that the graphics aren't as mouth watering as they were on the Gamecube, but RE4 still looks amazing in this PS2 conversion.  You play as Leon Kennedy, six years after the Raccoon City disaster of Resident Evil 2, and you're on a mission to rescue the President's daughter.  You're led to a creepy town where the locals, well, let's just say they're not too happy to see you.  I don't want to say much more about the story so not to ruin it for those who haven't played this, but make no mistake that it's the best storyline you'll ever see in a Resident Evil game.  The enemies are challenging and the boss battles are nothing short of epic, making RE4 the most action packed edition of the series yet.  The controls aren't as responsive as they should be, in fact, they can be downright clunky when they want to be, but for the most part they don't deter how amazing this game really is.  Capcom threw in some extras here as well, including side missions where you can play as the mysterious Ada Wong and alternate costumes and such.

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000B69E9G,S. Rhodes,2,1,"Now, here's the kicker: Do you want this game on PS2?  Especially if you already have the Gamecube version?  Well, let's find out shall we?  How about a little versus here.First of all, the graphics.  It's no contest here, the Gamecube version wins because of it's excellent lighting and framerate.  There are points in the PS2 version where it lags and just all around doesn't look as good.  This is mostly due to the PS2 being released in 2000, and it's realy starting to show it's age now.  Graphic wise, the Playstation 2 version just isn't as good. Plus, the Gamecube version ran much much smoother.  It's the little things about the PS2 version that stick out, such as how enemies are just... uglier and more blotchy.Now what about the gameplay?  Well, we can't accurately compare these two.  It depends on what you're looking for.  The PS2 version is certainly harder, throwing in more enemies in certain areas.  The aiming system that made it incredible on the Gamecube is back, and it's just about the same.  In all essence, the gameplay on PS2 is exactly the same.  However, I CAN rightfully give it to the PS2 version because the control scheme is just all around easier than the Gamecube version.  Simple to learn, and easy to use.It's no contest that the PS2 has more secrets and extras to unlock.  The most rewarding being Separate Ways"".  Gamecube version had ""Assignment Ada"" but ""Separate Ways"" which is a side story featuring Ada, is just as good.  The PS2 version also has new weapons to unlock and more costumes.The storyline remains the same, the presidents daughter is kidnapped and it's up to CIA agent Leon S. Kennedy to go to the mysterious village and save her.Sound wise, again, is a tie.  Both versions sound exactly the same in all aspects including voice acting (which is terrific).Basically, the PS2 version is like receiving a special edition DVD to one of your favorite movies of all time.  The downgraded graphics are no problem.  ""Separate Ways"" on it's own does make this version worth a buy.  Other than that, the Gamecube version is a little more superior as far as presentation.  But the extras do make the PS2 version worthwhile.In other words, it depends on what you're looking for.  If you just want solid gameplay, get the Gamecube version (if you don't have it already).  And when it comes to all those nifty secrets, the PS2 version is far superior... but note that there aren't THAT many new features, guys.So it is worth it, even on the Playstation 2.  If you already have the Gamecube version, I'd still pick up the PS2 version.  You may even stumble upon things you missed on the 'cube.Don't be turned away by the downgraded graphics, think of all the extras--especially Ada's ""Separate Ways"".""",5,The Playstation 2 Version is Worth It!,2005/10/30 0:00

We have Okami from Clover Studios which not only has a quite striking and beautiful graphic style but a unique gameplay idea which made many magazine and website people make it a buzz game and a must play. It's certainly a great game and one that, unfortunately, probably won't get as much attention as it should.Story: In Kamini Village, it became a tradition to offer a maiden to the dreaded demon Orochi. But when one maiden is picked which a swordsman named Nagi harbors a love for, he steps in to take him down only he's not as powerful. A white wolf named Shiranui steps in and helps and vanquishes Orochi before Shiranui succumbs to his injuries. 100 years later, Orochi is reborn and the white wolf is brought back with the spirit of the powerful god Amaratesu and with the help of a companion Issun, the mystical Celestial Brush and Nagi's descendant have to once again bring down Orochi.Graphics: I always grow suspicious of game creators' claims that a game is a painting come to life and whatnot but with Okami that's literally the case. It makes you feel that you're literally inside a painting and such scenes, such as restorations of cursed areas are quite beautiful and awesome. And I never got tired of seeing them either with probably my favorite effect being the water splashes and waterfalls. This is an example of a game creating an atmosphere and not needed expensive flashy FMV's to do it.Sound/Music: Similar to Animal Crossing, the characters don't necessarily speak in English but in gibberish with English text provided. While it is disappointing that there's no voice, it probably would've took too much space anyway but seeing a dramatic scene and see character ramble like they're intoxicated is kind of odd. The music though is quite appropriate and even lovely in places.Gameplay: One of the 2 aspects to get attention, one of which being the graphics, was the Celestial Brush. Basically you can unleash your inner Picasso where pressing R1 turns the screen into a canvas where you can draw certain shapes. Enemies can be cut by drawing a straight line, trees and flowers can be fully restored and bloom by drawing a circle around it and there's others but I don't want to spoil them. While there's not a lot of variety in the patterns, it's still quite a cool gameplay idea that never gets stale or useless.The game isn't really chockful of sidequests where you have to hunt down certain people or do certain things to get anywhere but instead it offers a whole range of stuff to do that is optional yet recommended. Certain actions, such as feeding animals or restoring trees and cursed grass nets you Praise, which you can use to upgrade your guy, by getting him more ink or more health. You'll become a bounty hunter going after certain enemies on your wanted list and filling your fish catalog when you go fishing. There's so much to do that it seems daunting but that's ok, it works just fine.Should you play Okami? Definately. Like fans of Ico who didn't get it upon initial release.

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000E991PC,S. Rhodes,15,14,"Hands down, Okami is one of the finest Playstation 2 games ever made.  An engrossing story mixed with intricate gameplay make Okami a textbook example of how a game should be done.  Okami is a masterpiece that brings a huge world to life, and any action/adventure fan would be happy to have this title on their shelf.Okami centers on the legend of the Japanese sun god Amaterasu.  The game stays centered around Japanese tales.  You needn't know these stories to be engrossed in the games overall main story, though.  All you need to know from the get go is Amaterasu is the sun god reborn as a wolf to rid Japan of a demonic curse that has swept the land.  The God responsible for this was actually killed 100 years ago.  It's time to make sure history doesn't repeat itself, and it's up to Amaterasu to get rid of this evil God.  Amaterasu is joined by her companion Issun, who throughout the game will do all the talking, and also provides a nice sense of humor to the game.  At first the story is simplistic, but don't be fooled.  There are several subplots in the game that eventually become part of the overall story.  You'll do more than stop this curse from spreading across the land.  You'll rescue villages, battle fearsome monsters and everything epic in Okami.  It also helps that the game is a massive 30 hours of steady going gameplay.The story is mostly told through beautiful cutscenes, and quite a bit of dialogue.  None of the dialogue is directly spoken so you'll have to read it all.  It's unfortunate that a masterpiece such as Okami doesn't have voice acting, but in the end it's forgiveable.  The cinematics and artistic style of Okami are fantastic.  Visually the game is by far one of the best looking of any game this generation.  It's so distinct and original.  There's no game out there that looks like this.  Equally impressive is the fantastic music score that clearly defines the setting of the game and actually brings you into its unique world.You'll be able to explore quite a bit of the world.  There's a lot of running around to do and you'll have some excitement doing it.  Amaterasu carries around a sword like weapon all the time which she'll use whenever she engages in a battle.  Battling isn't tough in Okami, nor is it too frequent to the point where it's annoying.  So you won't be frustrated while traveling through Okami and putting up a good fight.  The battle mechanics work almost like any other action/adventure title with one exception: the powers of the gods at your disposal.Throughout the journey Amaterasu can use a brush technique to unleash her powers as well as the powers of her allies.  When in battle you can press R1 and it will bring up a canvas.  You'll then be given control of a paint brush and you can unleash several powers.  When it gets dark out you can use the paint brush to make the sun come back up.  There are other powers too, such as being able to cut through stone.  This mechanic takes a moment to get used to at first, but you'll adapt surprisingly fast.  Even better, this isn't a simple gimmick.  You'll find it imperative to use these powers to solve puzzles and progress further on in your adventure.  It's an integral part of the gameplay and storyline.  You don't start off with all the powers of the paint brush, of course, you'll have to travel through the game and get them.  This system certainly breathes new life into the genre as a whole.As you go on your adventure, you'll also be given chances to make Amaterasu more powerful.  You can learn moves at the dojo, and you can find health powerups, and get more ink reserves for your brush techniques.  There are also plenty of weapons and items to help you out on your quest.  The game is easy, even when faced against some of the bosses, but it's a lot of fun, and has a lot of variety.  You could go through Okami never actually dying once.  This isn't to say the game doesn't have its challenges.  Some puzzles have their own unique challenges that could leave you stumped for a moment.Okami is also full of plenty of other small things you can do as you traverse the land.  You can restore vegetation to the land, feeding animals in need of food.  These don't sound too appealing, but there are a couple of things that make it worth your while.  For starters, these scenes just look beautiful.  Second, you get praise for doing so.  Praise helps you to improve your powers and strengths.  These aspects of the game can keep you busy for quite some time.Okami is a masterpiece.  A highly expansive game with a vast world to explore.  It's beautiful cinematics and well crafted storyline, among a few other things, make this one of the best Playstation 2 games out there.  It's simply a fantastic game to play and the fun last for a long time.  Okami is the definition of quality.The Good+Engrossing storyline+The game is absolutely beautiful; among the best looking for the Playstation 2+The game sounds fantastic+Battling is a lot of fun+The brush techniques are really innovative+Plenty of side-quest and mini games to keep you busy+For an action/adventure title the journey is long, lasing for over 30 hours... on top of that the game is full of replay valueThe Bad-The only truly bad thing about Okami is that there is no voice acting in the game.

Capcom's Okami however, is just that, and it's not just one of the best games to ever grace the PS2, it's one of the most original games you'll ever play.  The first thing you'll notice about Okami is the game's incredibly unique art style and graphics, which are some of the best to ever grace the PS2.  Seriously, this game looks incredible, you won't believe your eyes.  Okami's storyline is based on Japanese legend dealing with the sun god Amaterasu, who you play as in the form of a white wolf, and the epic quest that awaits him.  Now, what truly sets Okami apart from the rest of the pack is the caligraphy-esque celestial brush that you must use to advance throughout the game.  Need a bridge?  Draw it.  Need to dispatch a pesky enemy?  Draw him in half.  This brush adds a new dynamic to the gameplay which is fresh and unique, and makes you wonder why no one has ever tried anything like it before in a game of this type.  There's loads of side quests and mini-games as well, adding to the length of Okami which truly make it an epic game, and all of which help make this one of the best games ever on the PS2.  If there's anything bad to say about Okami, it's that the combat can get too easy at spots, but that is only an extremely minor gripe.  All in all, Okami is just the thing that PS2 owners have been waiting and yearning for.

A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B000E991PC,"Richard Baker BinaryMessiah""""",1,1,"The Good: Absolutely superb graphics, Celestial brush is fun, unique, and amazing, well thought out story and characters, great script writing, combat is fun and intuitive, puzzles are easy yet rewarding, lots to do, huge open world, long story, urinating and defecating on enemies is awesome!The Bad: No voices can make things seem a bit empty, having to backtrack often can get tedious, not really challenging, some humor isn't for the kiddiesThe first thing everyone notices about Okami is it's unique and one-of-a-kind art style that has never been used in a game before. The art style is the main drive of Okami and feels so refreshing and is just so easy on the eyes. The graphics also push the PS2 to the limits and the world in Okami is HUGE and vast and there is so much to learn and do. The second thing people will notice is the wonderful Celestial Brush game mechanic. When you hit R1 the screen turns into a canvas and you can paint different strokes to activate certain techniques you learn along your adventure. This mechanic is very intuitive and fun and doesn't get old at all.There are just so many fine details about Okami that you could never really say them unless you played the game yourself. The story in Okami is very original and interesting and you actually don't get lost in it at all. The characters in this game are memorable and you'll end up caring for most of them. The combat in the game is great as well. You can learn new combos and use different weapons and also use your brush during combat. The puzzles in this game aren't mind bending which is good and keeps the pace flowing and everything is just so well thought out and blended together.The only gripes really is that there's no voices and the noise they use for the voices instead is very annoying. Having to backtrack a lot can sometimes feel tedious especially when you want to move onto a new area. I also have to mention the infamous urinating and defecating skill you can learn to get extra loot from enemies! This is very funny and fun at the same time. Another note is this game has a lot of mature humor in it and isn't really for the youngins. There are just so many things that are great about Okami it would take too long to just say it all.The game is about 40-45 hours so you don't have to worry about this beautiful game feeling too short. You HAVE to own or play this game all the way through and there's no excuse for it! I'll tell you this though it's a lot better the Twilight Princess that everyone says this game rips off.

A2582KMXLK2P06,B000ERVMI8,B. E Jackson,1,1,"I honestly don't believe New Super Mario Bros. for the Wii is a bad game by ANY means.  However it basically does nothing that the original SMB NES series hasn't already done and perfected, not to mention uses several of the Super Mario World concepts as well.  This game is basically just a graphically enhanced version of the classic Super Mario Bros. series and copies what's already been done and the only real addition are two new power suits- the overrated penguin suit that gives Mario the ability to slide around, and the admittedly pretty awesome propeller suit- a VERY convenient and popular item that lets Mario reach the star coins in tricky locations (more on that below).Look at the backgrounds in the first few stages and worlds.  The grasslands is basically nothing new- the first Super Mario Bros. and SMB3 games already perfected these similar backgrounds many years ago.  The concept of collecting coins, stomping on goombas, avoiding koopas, etc, has all remained *exactly* the same, so this definitely means Nintendo is cashing in on the improved technology of the Wii to bring back an old platform favorite of millions.  And you know, I actually don't mind the decision to bring it back *that* much (hence the 3-star rating).  I just wish the game wasn't so identical to the classic Mario Bros. games in so many crucial areas.  Gameplay, level design, and backgrounds all resemble the original SMB games.  This makes New Super Mario Bros. Wii nothing particularly noteworthy or original- just something intended for newbies of the 2D sidescroller series and hardly providing anything original for any of the older Mario Bros. fans.The similarities are obvious, everywhere.  The ghost houses, moving platforms and lava stages shamelessly copy what's already been done in Super Mario World *especially* in the case of the ghost houses.  They are boring in this game.  The desert world looks a lot like the one from Super Mario Bros. 3 on the All-Stars edition.  The same similarities present themselves in the ice and water worlds.  After a while you totally forget about the graphics being Nintendo's selling point here since you're so caught up in the cliched gameplay (which admittedly is *fun* gameplay, but nothing original).  I expected Nintendo would make the overall experience more impactful by taking advantage of the Wii's technology.  The platform jumps themselves are really bland in the first few worlds since the stages themselves aren't very memorable.  The one with icicles falling down and creating platforms to progress forward is too bland for words.  This stuff wasn't boring back in the 80's and early 90's, but bringing back the same concept in today's world doesn't really work in my opinion.  New Super Mario Bros. Wii just falls short of greatness.Some of the things I love- the challenge of the special world (World 9).  It's a VERY challenging world to acquire all the star coins.  Collecting 3 star coins per stage throughout the first 8 worlds is important since they enable World 9 to open.  World 8's very first level is *incredible*.  A fast paced run to the finish with cool music in the background with a rockin' rhythm.  That's clearly the best music in the game.  The challenge is actually pretty high starting around World 7, but World 9 takes the cake in that regard.  World 9 is almost unbearably difficult at times (at least, if your intention is to collect the 3 star coins and this *should* be your intention otherwise you'd be missing out on the bonus world).  The Bowser fight is amazing too- much better than any of the fights in the classic Mario series.  Now you have to outrun his wall-destroying fireballs to reach safety!  Really exciting race to the finish.  Unfortunately the same cannot be said for his Koopa kids- those fights are basically not much different than the ones in SMB3.  They're actually easier and most of them are lame.  One Koopa kid fight has platforms moving up and down while you try and land on his head 3 times.  It's really easy believe me.  They dumbed down Wendy too- her rings are easy to avoid now.  Boo!  Mini Bowser, or Bowser Jr., presents a few interesting fights along the way however.  The battle where you have to ram his spaceship into an electric wall is REALLY fun.  The airship-type levels aren't nearly as memorable as the SMB3 ones I'm afraid.  They aren't lengthy or bomb-explosive enough.Still, despite the first half of the game being derivative and bland, the second half of the game is actually a pretty big improvement (though inconsistent at times, but I'm in a generous and forgiving mood).  I wish the game wasn't so generous with 1-ups though.  You can easily max out at 99 by World 8.  This is a result of the game just being too darn easy.  It's okay to lose lives once in a while, something many new gamers don't believe in.  You had to grow up in the NES days to understand that it's okay to die when encountering an overwhelming challenge.  In fact you're *supposed* to die until you find a way to complete it.  I recommend skipping over this game and picking up New Super Mario Bros. U instead- despite being another copycat of the classic SMB series of yesteryears, THAT game is incredibly fun and harder overall with more exciting platform jumps and item collecting along the way.  SMBU fills in all the tiny details that effectively makes the levels more exciting and creative compared to this average Wii New Super Mario Bros. game.  Lay down the extra bucks for a Wii U and go with New Super Mario Bros. U instead if you're in such desperate need of a new 2D Mario game.",3,new mario- just the same as old mario,2008/4/26 0:00
A36UKFV79879MD,B000ERVMI8,BX Lounger,0,0,"When the Nintendo DS was released in 2005, it initially sold well despite the fact that the launch games were less than stellar. Thankfully, the quality games flowed in steadily about a year later and New Super Mario Bros was released in 2006 to glowing reviews and success at the register. Since so many people have reviewed this game, I'll just put my two cents out there.This game takes elements of Super Mario Bros 3 and Super Mario World, adds  a 2 player VS mode and a 4 player VS mini-games mode and mixes it all together to create an excellent game for the DS. It looks fantastic, plays perfectly and mixes in everything you knew about the classic Mario games with the modern updates to graphics, sounds and music. 8 brand new worlds (plus a secret world) await you to explore and conquer and you will have a blast while doing so. Nintendo just about got everything right when making this game.If by chance you haven't played it yet, you need to if you bought a DS.

A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B000ERVMI8,"Christopher Barrett Evil Corgi""""",4,4,"Since there are hundreds of reviews, I'll be brief.  I grew up with Super Mario Brothers (yes I bought the original NES with the Mario/Duck Hunt combo).  I enjoyed SMB 2 (despite it not being a SMB game in Japan) and SMB 3.  When Nintendo released Super Mario World, I felt that they had reached new levels of playability, complexity, and fun.  Where the previous games had lacked depth (though SMB3 had a bit more), this game expanded the realm of the series so greatly.  They added in new worlds, the ability to traverse all of the worlds freely (once they levels were cleared) and secrets galore.  I spent a lot of time trying to clear every 'exit'.  Super Mario World 2 pushed the envelope by adding 100% clear goals (all the red coins, yoshi tokens, stars).  Now you had real motivation to replay levels and attempt to clear them with 100% of the items, striving for perfection.  It encouraged you to replay tough levels and hone your skills.  Bravo!Now New Super Mario Brothers takes elements of each of these games and puts it in a nice retro package.  The art and graphics are superb and are clearly some of the best on the DS.  The tunes are generic, but old school and clearly Mario Brothers styled.  When I first played it, my friend quipped, What is that you're playing?  It sounds like an old Mario game!"".Some of the mechanics are off, but I am forgiving (often you jump to squash something and the jump tends to fall short sometimes, I know it's something you get used to, but the jumping doesn't feel like Mario games in the past).What I am less forgiving about is the lack of depth.  You collect three large coins in each level which can be used to unlock doors and secrets on the map (mainly to get items or one ups).  Other than collecting these coins, there is little else to do other than clear the levels.  Some levels have secret exits (like beating the boss of world 2 in tiny form unlocks world 4 in stead of world 3).  But I found little joy in replaying the levels.There are a few fun mini-games as well, though they are nothing earth shattering.  Kind of a Mario Party sampling.Overall this is a fun game, a cross between SMB1 and SMB3 but with some elements from Super Mario World.  I actually checked it out at my local library instead of buying it (though I am a compulsive DS game buyer).  I am glad I tried before I bought.If you have funds to toss down on a DS platformer, grab one of the Castlevania titles instead, unless you are a die hard SMB fan!""",4,"Really like it, but pales compared to the true classics ~",2011/6/16 0:00
A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000ERVMI8,"Cloud ...""""",2,2,"To be honest, despite the fact that Mario is probably THE most well-known and popular character in Nintendo's repertoire and probably in gamedom period, I always had an inkling towards stuff like Legend of Zelda or Final Fantasy. Like many game franchises, there's enough familiarity and basic gameplay that anyone can pick up but in the end you want to feel like that was one of the best Marios ever"". In that regard, New Super Mario Bros is enjoyable in a way but it's also a bit too familiar and certain things are kind of all over the place.Story: Oh, do I have to say this? Okay fine, here goes: Princess got kidnapped and Mario has to go save her and in order to do so he has to keep travelling to different worlds to get there. I mean, Mario plots have never been about this so if you're thinking something even remotely in-depth as far as Mario is concerned like its Paper series, check your head.Graphics: This is where the game shines. While it's still 2D graphics, they're pretty attractive, well-animated and incredibly colorful. The overworld graphics resemble the board game look of Mario Party which gives it a better immersive quality rather than a yellow circle(Super Mario World) or a black square(Mario 3).Sound/Music: Surprisingly it's kind of forgettable. The music fits the world but it feels somewhat detached as if playing the game makes you tune out what you're hearing. Despite the fact that it's fine in the game,I call this a ""stereo"" game: I just put on a cd rather than listen to the game itself.Gameplay: Same as always: jump button, special button such as getting a flower you can shoot fireballs. The one problem is that the special button also acts as a sort of ""run"" but strangely Mario just feels sluggish which I've never had a problem with in a Mario game. There were times that I died simply because Mario didn't run fast enough to leap a ledge or simply he would just...slip off. I named it ""Butterfingers syndrome"" when I was young.The main selling point I guess is that Mario can nab a Large Mushroom and he essentially becomes ""Mariozilla"" where he just rampages through the level with a meter showing his escalading destruction. It's a neat idea but it either doesn't last long enough or it's just something that's not as fundamental to the gameplay. Think back to when Leafs and Feathers brought about new level exits and secrets but here it's just fun in a ""destroy! destroy!"" kinda way.Is it challenging for the young ones? It can be. Couple stages bugged me but whether that was my bad abilities(doubt it) or the game itself(maybe) but it's still one of the better DS games you can find but it's probably not its best.""",5,"Classic gameplay but not really classic"" to me""",2006/12/27 0:00

AN81JUYW2SL24,B000ERVMI8,Gearhead Mania,1,1,"New Super Mario Brothers DSMini games are kind of fun, they rely on different skill sets, one even uses the microphone.The overall game itself is a combination of elements from Mario Bros 1-3, Super Mario World, and Mario 64. The stylus isn't used much for the normal game, but the controls are easy enough. You basically have the same controls as Mario Bros 1. The most frustrating part of the game is the save system. Granted, most of the levels are very easy and short. But many people have normal lives outside of games, so we tend to rely on frequent saves. In New Super Mario Bros, you can only save after major milestones or after you beat certain areas of the map (castles are one example). The graphics and sound are top notch, typical of all Super Mario games. Again, there are elements of all the previous Mario games in the DS version. Some of the sounds and moves are directly from Mario 3 and Mario World, while the audio sound bytes reminded me of Mario 64.There's no Yoshi or any way to fly/float/glide.

With New Super Mario Bros DS, you get the game fun gameplay - enhanced - in a nice portable system.This isn't just a remake - it is sort of like how the Wizard of Oz starts out in black and white in a gritty, quiet town and then turns into multi-color, sparkling larger than life song-filled splendour. You get the NES versions of the game with similar - but not exactly the same - levels that have been updated from 2D to 3D. You get extra features like ground pounds, and mushrooms that make you SUPER large - you don't have to jump to break blocks any more, you can just walk and crash into them. Other mushrooms make you incredibly tiny, to reach places you could not before.The combination of old style classic gameplay and updated graphic, sounds, and features is really quite good. These games were stellar in the first place, with their addictive levels that were just the right balance of challenging and fun. Add in the easy to carry with you DS gameplay, the new features and hidden things to look for, and I really found this just about perfect for an arcade game.Yes, you could complain that you can zap through the game in a full day of gameplaying. However, this game series wasn't ever meant to be a month long role playing complex adventure"". It was always meant to be short, easily playable sessions that you could fit in while you waited for dinner to be ready. You could save and exit when you had to run to school, and then pick up again when you had time the next day without having to review 8 pages of storyline notes.This makes the game PERFECT for carrying around in your DS. If you end up waiting in line for 20 minutes, you get through another section. If your bus gets stuck in traffic, that's another level you can get through.Plus, there is replayability here, while you try to track down the hidden items and coins.I enjoyed the minigames as well. Certainly you wouldn't buy this game FOR the minigames, but heck, if they're going to throw them in for free, you might as well enjoy them! I'm not usually one for DS multiplayer games, but it's nice that they did include that as well for those who want to play with a friend.In general I was quite impressed with this, and recommend it heartily!""",5,Great Enhanced Remix of Classic Games,2006/7/1 0:00

While there are great games out there that have been well-receieved like Halo, Doom, Madden '06, and others that've really shown a great depth of universal appeal. That has definitely also been the case with Mario. Since 1981, as Jumpman in Donkey Kong, Mario has been the most universal of all the video game characters and personas ever, and continues to develop with the times. That also has been shown with the Nintendo DS as well. The breakout success of Nintendo's latest handheld system has really been a great transition to how we play video games on hand with the stylus, and appeal of the dual screen action. Now, Mario is set to have that classic feeling all over again.New Super Mario Brothers for the Nintendo DS brings a updated appeal to Mario, loosely based on the classic 2-D games he has been widely known for from Super Mario Brothers 1, 2, 3. and Super Mario World from the Super NES era. The object is just like the object from before, as you play Mario or Luigi, and try to go after Bowser and Bowser Jr. from stealing Princess Toadstool a.k.a. Peach. The game features over 80 different levels of exciting, and enjoyable gameplay. The game includes the classic moves from previous titles like the ground pounding (Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine), and the carrying turtle shells to defeat Koopa Troopas and Goombas (Super Mario Brothers), as well as new features like the mega mushroom which can turn Mario into a King Kong size, to really pound and knockout your competition. The graphics and the gameplay are just absolutely breathtaking and amazing, and really delivers what had been done from the early Mario titles before, while the sound is just purely classic. The control also is percise and in tune to each movement of Mario and company.All in all, this is the second full length Mario adventure title to really deliver well for the Nintendo DS. Like what happened with Super Mario 64 DS did to showcase the brilliance of the DS, New Super Mario Brothers delivers the fun and appeal of a classic game, to a whole new generation of gamers. I definitely think this is one of the most definitive titles available for the Nintendo DS, and I really definitely think it should be a standard to your Nintendo DS library.Graphics: ASound: A-Control: A+Fun & Enjoyment: A+Overall: A 1/2+",5,A Classic Plumber Really Reborn,2006/5/16 0:00

(Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...,0,0,"(NOTE: SINCE JULY 2012, THIS REVIEW HAS BEEN ENTIRELY REWRITTEN)Well, since New Super Mario Bros 2 is coming out for the 3DS later, I kinda figured I may as well go back and look at the title that started a series that harks back to the even-older days. I remember when I used to be really excited for this one. After seeing a picture of a supersized Mario running through a field of Koopas, I had to get it. However, it kept being delayed....And then when it finally came out, I got it, and I wasn't disappointed.Those that have played the original Super Mario Bros series (as well as Super Mario World) know what to expect. Classic 2D Goomba-stomping block-breaking action throughout all-new levels. This is something we haven't seen since Super Mario World (Although there have been remakes and stuff), so it is pretty cool getting fresh 2D Super Mario action once again. What's also great is that the gameplay still remains to be good fun, and with all these new levels, as well as some other elements mixed in, it just makes it even better.One downside is that while the minigames were a nice touch, but they were mostly recycled from Super Mario 64 DS. I guess it's okay for those that don't own Mario 64 DS, but those expecting new minigames will be disappointed.However, 4-Player multiplayer makes the minigames fresh again! Meanwhile, you can also play with a friend in a Versus mode in while Mario and Luigi compete and find Stars around 5 levels. That is pretty fun, actually, especially when getting to use the power-ups to sabotage the other player.Overall, this is a pretty great adventure that does the original SMB series justice.

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000ERVMI8,S. Rhodes,21,19,"It's been fifteen years since Mario had a completely original 2D side-scroller with him as the star.  There were ports of his 2D adventures brought to the Gameboy Advance, but that was about it.  There was also Yoshi's Island on the Super Nintendo (and later released on the Gameboy Advance), but really, that was more of a Yoshi"" game.  Anyway, New Super Mario Bros. is without a doubt one of the finest Nintendo DS games out there.  Fans of the classic Mario games will absolutely love this.As usual, Princess Toadstool has been kidnapped.  By Bowser Jr. who is just like his father.  Now the brothers have to go and save her and defeat the King Koopa, along with his son.  For those expecting a storyline... there is none!  This is where the classic feel begins to come in.  Mario, you've got to understand, isn't about story.  It's about gameplay, and that's where New Super Mario Bros. hits high.The game spans eight worlds, and a lot of classic gameplay comes back along with new additions that make the game interesting to play.  Mario still has basics such as the flower, but he also has some new moves he can do as well.  For one, he can grab a Mega-Mushroom and become the size of the DS screen and trample through all his enemies and the environment.  Mario can also hop inside a blue koopa troopa shell.  The shell allows him to traverse across the landscape just like a shell would if he were to kick it.  There is also a Mini-Mushroom that once Mario grabs a hold of, he'll shrink to be able to fit into places that otherwise can't be accessed.  Mario also has some moves from Super Mario 64.  The ground pound, for stomping blocks from atop and the wall jump.  These moves aren't just there, either.  There will be times in the game when you'll have to use them.  Also from Super Mario 64 is the triple jump.  The only downside the vast amount of moves and items Mario can hold is simple: There's no item that allows him to fly.The touchscreen isn't really needed to play the game at all.  Mario can store an item on the bottom screen.  Touching it with your stylus simply makes it fall from the sky for him to grab.  Very similar to Super Mario World.  That's all the touch screen is used for in this game.  It's not really a bad thing unless you happen to be someone who thrives on the touch screen.The eight worlds are huge as well.  There's an overworld map very similar to Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World.  Select a stage and jump right in.  For those only going to the goal, the game isn't all that hard at all.  If you just want to go for the goal, the game is rather simple.  However, just going for the goal will cause you to miss out on half the fun of the game.  Two worlds, for example, aren't accessed by traditional means.  In other words, if you want to see all of the game, you can't just go to the flagpole in every level.  You'll have to actually work to see all the game has to offer.  There's a lot of work to be done to master New Super Mario Bros.  For starters, some levels, much like Super Mario World, have more than one exit.  There are also special coins scattered throughout levels that you'll have to collect in order to reach secret pathways along the world map.  This is where most of the games challenge comes from.  Most of these special coins aren't easy to grab and involve you taking a few risks.  The game manages to keep you busy for a while, provided you're not just heading for the goal. All together, this game presents you with 80 levels, all of them full of secrets.Each level also has it's own natural disasters.  There are some of your normal enemies.  Also along the way are natural disasters such as rolling hills and whirlpools in the underwater levels.  Enemies also come in various sizes.  So just because you've seen one goomba one size, doesn't mean he can't be bigger.  Most boss fights, however, are a little on the predictable side, but they're still a lot of fun to play.The only other thing that keeps New Super Mario Bros. down is how save management is done.  You can save after a castle, warp, tower or after you've spent five star coins to bypass a sign.  But you can only save from each spot once.  So if you find yourself having to save and you've already cleared a castle, you can't clear that same castle again to save.  This doesn't really cause problems, but if you find yourself in a tight situation you'll wish it was just like the Mario Advance games when you could save just about anywhere.Aside from the games spectacular levels, there is also a multiplayer feature that allows one person to be Mario and the other to be Luigi in a competition.  Competing against your friend is a lot of fun.  You'll both go into an arena and try to collect five stars.  There are five arenas in all, and collecting stars from your friend can be a fun task.  It can be addicting as well. Also thrown in are those mini-games from Super Mario 64 DS.  However, even these mini-games have been tweaked, and trust me, it's for the better.  The mini-games from Super Mario 64 DS can also be used in wireless play now for you to compete against your friends.  If you already found these mini-games addictive before, you might want to try them in multiplayer mode.  They get better.  Even better, to play multiplayer only requires that one person have the game.  The rest is done through the DS's download play.Graphic wise, New Super Mario Bros. looks great.  One of the best-looking side scrolling games out there.  It's a perfect bland of 2D side scrolling with 3D effects.  The enemies are all 3D, and so are most of the landscapes.  But you'll tackle them in classic side-scrolling feel.  Most of the background effects are 2D, and they look fantastic as well.  Everything is colorful and vibrant.  It's also thanks to this 3D engine that Mario can do half the things he can do.And then there's the music.  Mario fans can bask in nostalgia.  Most of the music is remixed, and it's remixed quite well, I must say.  Some enemies will also change their behavior based on the background music (they might jump to the beat).  The soundtrack is just a blast to listen to, and might fill old school gamers with a lot of fond memories. Mario also has a voice, as usual.  And like some of his games on the Gameboy Advance, they get old after a while.  Most gamers probably won't mind, though.Overall, this is by far one of the best title to reach the Nintendo DS.  Mario is back to his side-scrolling roots and it's more impressive than any of us could've dreamed.  New antics and level designs keep it from being a repeat of what Mario could do in his 16-bit and 8-bit days.

It is a zany action survival-horror game with the ability to pick up any weapon and bash, shoot, stab, slice, or chop zombies or the endless crazy people who reside in the mall. It's not a scary game by any means, it's just a hilarious game of blood, guts, and dismemberment. The zombies at times have the same looks as others but that's never really bothersome, there are some targeting issues as well, along with save problems. This is a stellar title that should not be missed because of how fun it is to kill zombies and take pictures of gruesome scenes like the chick who falls off a building in the beginning.

You play a photojournalists trapped for 3 days in a suburban mall full of zombies.This game is a mixed blessing. Let's start with all the good aspects. The game is FUN. We've all seen the movies with zombies staggering around, and we've all hung out in malls, feeling bored. Put the two together, and voila! You can walk into any store and grab things to bash the zombies with. Run them over with a lawnmower! Pick up a piece of wood and start swinging! Or, my personal favorite, grab an electric guitar at the music store, whip it around like a fast-moving samurai sword, and hear the TWANG when you make contact!The food system actually makes sense here. You go into food court shops! If you find the food in its base form, it's mildly healthy. If you take the time to cook it, it's even better for you.There's an interesting plot to go with it too. I love that the various humans have names and that you actually learn about them, see their interactions and connect with them. You really care (or at least I do!) when you screw up and they get killed. It gives you a lot of incentive to replay the game to try to get everybody out. If you save a husband and his wife, they have a joyful reunion! It really draws you into the game.So there is definitely a lot going for this game. However, there are a few signs that the game could have used a few more months in testing before it was released. First, we have a large high def TV, so we don't have a problem seeing things"". However, I've heard from many of my site visitors that on smaller TVs it's nearly impossible to read words or to understand the text messages. That's just unfair. They should have made the game easily playable even on non-high-def or smaller TVs.Plus, why have to read dialogue at all in a horror game? That really interferes with the immersive quality. If you're knee deep in zombie fighting, you don't want to have to puzzle out what a victim is saying to you. They should just yell it out to you in real time so you can keep swinging while you listen.The real killer here, though, is the loading screen. You take 5 steps. LOADING. You turn around. LOADING. You go up the stairs. LOADING. Good God!! With all the other HUGE map games out on the market that load seamlessly, there is no reason that a mall-based game could not do the same. It might have taken a month of coding time to work that in but it would have been WELL worth it.Also, the save system is questionable. Only one save? One save at all? What if a friend comes over and wants to play forward for the weekend, but you want to be able to have your save spot for your own play after he leaves? You can't? Having just one save spot, in a world with a massive hard drive of storage, is nonsensical.Still, you can deal with those issues, and the game really is a lot of fun. Remember though that it is a MATURE game with zombies with exploding heads and a lot of gore. So if you're a mature gamer who enjoys horror, definitely pick this one up!""",4,Great Horror Fun for a Mature Gamer,2006/10/6 0:00

Taking a page from Dawn of the Dead, you play as freelance photojournalist Frank West, and you have 72 hours to get your story and get out of the zombie-infested mall that you now find yourself in.  What makes Dead Rising so much fun is the sheer number of ridiculous and bloody ways you can take out your zombie attackers, using just about anything you find in the mall as a weapon.  The mall itself is wonderfully designed as well, as it always seems as if there is something new to discover.  The game's story is intriguing as well, offering a bit of satirization of the current political climate, and the little touches in the game, from being able to take pictures to the buckets of blood, are fantastic.  What hurts Dead Rising is the handful of technical issues that really mar what is otherwise a would-be spectacular game.  The escort missions, which you will be taking part in quite frequently, are annoying more than anything else, mainly due to the fact that the AI of those you're escorting is less than flattering.  Also, the game's save system is frequently glitchy, and often detracts from the game's real time world and structure.  Flaws aside however, Dead Rising offers much to enjoy; from great graphics and voice acting to some nice homages to classic zombie movies, the game is a real treat.  All in all, Dead Rising is one of the best and original third-party experiences to find on the XBox 360, and if you've missed out on it so far, you should definitely give it a look at the very least.",4,Chopping mall,2008/2/16 0:00
AFV2584U13XP3,B000F3AADE,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),0,0,"While the past six+ years have shown a vast improvement on graphics and effects after this game was released this game is still an entertaining one to play,just don't expect too much of a great thing from the game though.  The game while not open world like Dead Island still gives you vast room and items to use throughout your missions as opposed to the RE franchise where you had only two choices of weapons guns or knives most times even when you were surrounded by items that could used as makeshift weapons. The A.I. can be a pain especially for the survivors in the game,half the time they'll defend themselves pretty well other times they just seem to allow the zombies to have a bite of them and sometimes you're stuck having to go back for a survivor because apparently they don't know what to do unless you hold their hands for them. The boss battles are also insane,some being relatively easy others have you tearing out your hair as you try and land a hit on the boss.The time counter can be annoying sometimes too as you sometimes keep to much focus on that instead of the zombie trying to make a meal out of you. The weapons are interesting on how you use them and what they do but it can get a little repetitive as well when you use a lawnmower ten times with the same results.The graphics show their age,while not horrible you can't help but sometimes feel like you're playing an early generation game from the PS2/Xbox consoles though again expected.  The voice cast are also a hit and miss with the main protagonist doing a 50/50 job in his voice acting performance sometimes the voice acting is good sometimes it's terrible.  I got the game very late and relatively cheap as it was going for $10,so for a alright zombie game here's a good one to try out until the third one is released just don't heap too much expectations onto the game or you will feel some disillusionment.",4,While The Game Shows Its Age OverAll It's Not A Bad Zombie Game To Have,2013/7/3 0:00

This game is just 100% entertainment, The the whole premise of being trapped in a mall with zombies is a idea that has been done in movies but not in a game. You have total freedom going anywhere and everywhere in the mall with dozens of different stores that have items you can use as weapons, the game doesn't take itself seriously when it comes to this idea as you can so pretty funny stuff to zombies and gameplay feels arcady in that sense as you rack up points for taking pictures and killing zombies at the same time. Its a fun game regardless if you like zombies or not but its a challenge as well, the start of the game your character is pretty weak and in general slow but ask anyone who has played this game and they'll tell you dying is part of the game, in the beginning anyway. When you start the game focus on leveling up you character by taking pictures of zombies attacking,survivors and anything that looks important and you'll get a lot of PP which levels up Frank.

A2LPJD19MGBNXJ,B000F5IH2I,"Adrian Jenkins southerndudeman""""",9,5,"Well, I've gone pretty far into the new version of Final Fantasy, this being the 12thoffering in the long-running series (although 11 is only online, we also have 10 part2, so really we have seen 12). This one comes from the designer of Final Fantasy Tactics,and his stamp can be seen all over this game. Still, to keep this review from waxingover long, I won't go into that here. Instead, I'll stick to the game itself.Is it a masterpiece? Most certainly. But is it FUN? That's always the issue with the FFseries, which has pretty much guided RPG's for the last 15 years, for good and bad.And all in all, yes, this is a fun outing. The battle system, which certainly differsfrom previous outings, works pretty well, in my opinion. Unfortunately, the encounterrate is far too high, and the frustration factor can really kick in (Why isn't heattacking who I want? Who turned off my gambits? Why is this freaking explosion trapright in front of a door, and why can't my characters get around it without my havingto remove them from my party?""). I enjoy the fact that there is no transition fromfield map to battle screen, and I love being able to set up 10 or so independentcommands for my other party members to work on AI, but at the same time, I hate thefleeing mechanism (why do they need to take time to resheath their swords?), and ittakes so LONG to level at times.As for the story, I don't care for it. It is hard to feel any compassion or empathywith the main character, simply because his objective for the adventure is so obscuredand itis difficult to like any of the royals due to their stilted speech (it's likesomeone decided, ""Hey, people sounded cool in Lord of the Rings; let's carry that tothis game!). And as for the story itself, been there, done that. Final Fantasy 10 wasa nice change of pace, story-wise. Here, we return to Evil Empire taking over theland. Heck, I'm waiting for Golbez from FF2 to show up (many of the characters looklike him anyway).Moving around in the field is a chore as well. One may ride a chocobo, but if youwant to explore, this is NOT the way to go (you can only ride chocobos for a limitedtime, and then they leave you high and dry). Unfortunately, the field is so big, itis difficult to motivate yourself to search for, say, a hidden Esper or 10. Citieswould suffer from the same problem, except that one may teleport around cities byusing the Moogler (or whatever the heck they call it), so that experience is farpleasant.Of course, I gave this game 4 stars, so there must be something that I like. Indeed,the above are what I find to be the only bad points. Juxtapose that with the good(which includes a fantastic mini-game of hunting monsters, incredibly fun, anddifficult, boss fights, and for the first time, a sense of exploration that wassorely lacking in the other FF titles, particularly FF10, and ultimately you have awinner. In fact ,were this any other RPG title, it would knock my socks off.

A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B000F5IH2I,"Christopher Barrett Evil Corgi""""",1,1,"Let me equate my review by stating that I have been playing Final Fantasy games since the very first release when I was young.  I have been generally well impressed with the games, and have to say that 12 kept up the high bar.  I will list some of the faults that I have, but compared with many other PS2 RPGs, this one shines.First big plus: open exploration!  You now have huge, expansive maps to tread around.  No more random encounters unless you count the occasional monster popping out from behind things.  But in order to gain rare items and drops, you must take out a few monsters every now and then.  Oh, and for experience points.  But now it's fun to go hunting for particular monsters in order to secure some rare drops (from even common foes).The graphics are superb for the PS2.  They easily rival FFX with the improved engine and lack of static and flicker.  Detail on the characters is superb.  Yes, Vaan is weird looking (kind of like Meg Ryan on testosterone treatments).  The voice acting is superb, even in the English dub.  Again, not comparing to FFX (which was in a class all its own thanks to the amazing story).  Music is enjoyable and catchy, thanks to the same composer from FF Tactics and Vagrant Story.  It suits the moods and settings and never really gets irritating, even with long hours spent in certain areas with the same track playing.Warp crystals add a nice touch of the insta-travel.  You get access to them pretty soon, and they become indispensable.  Of course you have to 'touch' one first to be able to warp back to it. The addition of the hunts are nice.  These occur at all times and add a nice bit of side adventure challenge.  Especially if you are tackling a rather tough hunt at an early level.  The rewards are nice, and the weapons and items found can often be purchased or found later (which makes tacking these hunts later rather ho hum and easy).  There are many other side quests mixed in as well.The interface is nice.  Being able to target monsters, NPCs and such is nice.  You can actually see who you are targeting before attacking or speaking (avoid some long re-rants).  Battle is fluid and fun thanks to the gambit system.  The fact that the characters are all set to 'fight' is nice (though you can manually control them or remove the 'fight' gambit to have them prioritize some other action).  You can purchase or find gambits later on to make fighting even less of a headache.  Since battle is fast paced it makes since.  Again, you can slow it down and set it to queue up individual character actions if you want the true old school feel.  But with the gambits you could, say, have Fran attack the strongest enemy as her lowest priority, then cast fire on any enemy weak vs fire with higher priority, or heal a player with less than 30% HP as the highest.  You can still give commands, it just queues them up for that character's next action.  Again, fluid.  It takes some getting used to, and you can turn the gambits off on the fly.  To prevent someone from attacking that far away, yet creepily close level 25 T-Rex while you're at level 4 hunting quacktaurs or cockatrices (ouch!).  But the AI is basically set to whatever you want.  You have a max number of gambits, and can acquire new slots, but it still maxes out.  Just so you can't program dozens of gambits and then just take a nap while the game plays on.  But the system sure beats mashing the 'attack' button dozens of times.Finally we come to the story.  Rather... limp?  Not really weak, just not really all that exciting for a video game.  It is a more politics driven story and one with lots of subtleties.  But gone is the romance aspect (other than a few characters having a crush).  The main villain is also rather... ordinary.  After the cast of amazing baddies, you think that SE would be able to come up with someone better than Val Kilmer's stunt double.  And there is really no true 'last dungeon' instead it's a short, rather easy area.  The previous are though is massive and requires hours to reach the pinnacle.There are interesting side stories and secondary characters to keep things interesting.  Balthier is a treat to watch on screen.  Basch has some witty remarks here and there.  Ashe is full of pent up rage and angst, but not too whiny.  Vaan and Penelo were actually an afterthought.  Which is why they don't seem to work into the rest of the cast.  They were apparently added to appease the Japanese audience who they feared would not become interested in a huge cast of very Western' looking and acting characters.So the story does play out like a very slow version of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, but with all of the adventuring and side quests, you really can take quite a break between cut scenes and story advancements.  A worthy game that I still enjoy playing today, and one of the last truly Epic and truly adventurous mainstream RPGs.""",5,"Not the best storyline, but a solid RPG ~",2011/10/5 0:00
A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000F5IH2I,"Cloud ...""""",11,10,"I'll use the old cliche: RPG's have been hand in hand with Final Fantasy. In fact, there's even best-of lists devoted to non-Final Fantasy games. As such, it's hard to believe we haven't had a proper entry in the series since 2001 with Final Fantasy X. Yeah we had the online XI but really, who actually can afford all those fees and everything just to play the game? The twelth game in the series had a frustratingly long gestation period with numerous delays, people walking out as well as doubts about whether the game would actually be good. Must be tough for those who doubted the game. I don't know whether people will regard this as one of the series best but as it stands, this is probably the best RPG available right now.Story: Taking place in the world of Ivalice, the Archadian Empire has taken over the kingdom of Dalmasca, placing it under their rule. The story centers around a group of people who are caught up in political intrigue and mystery as well as the protection of Princess Ashe, the heir to the throne. As for this story, you might not respond in the way you did to Cloud and Aeris or Locke and Celes but the characters are endearing and the plot is definately the maturest they've done since VIII but what hurts the story is development. You can tell the emphasis was on the story as opposed to the characters so while they all go on this mission, there's really no personal interest in each other as a group. I will say though that I quite like Ashe's character and Balthier is the kind of sly cool guy we all wish we could be.Graphics: When X came out, the graphics quite frankly stunned me. They still do. Here, they stun but the novelty as worn off since they're not new but boy do they impress. The demo and intro movie are just gorgeous and the in-game cinematics are handled well. This is also probably one of the most fully-realized worlds I've seen. Everything here looks like it has a story to tell or a history and it's very easy to get immersed in. My one knock is that on my widescreen TV, there's actually space that's not used since it's for subtitles and the like and let's face it, with a story like this, you kinda need subtitles.Sound/Music: Done now by Hitoshi Sakimoto of Final Fantasy Tactics and Vagrant Story, I find his music well composed and arranged and he's great at using an orchestra but his problem is melodies, or shall we say, lack of them. Revisiting the soundtrack independent of the game made me appreciate some tracks more (the Esper Battle theme is power by definition really) but some tracks go through a few changes that while fine in the game, they're so overwritten it hurts the replayability. As for the voice acting, it's hit and miss. Sure characters like Basch and Balthier and especially Ashe work though she sounds slightly older, but then we have whiny Vaan(show you bad it is, Tidus to me outdoes this guy) and Fran has the most peculiar accent. Ultimately though their voices don't take you out of the game, they're just not as well cast in certain roles.Gameplay: The straw that might break the camel's back for some people. It used to be that you'd roam the field and whoosh! be met with battle music and the fight than a separate screen for your spoils such as EXP and Gil. Not here. The enemies appear on the field and you just walk right up to them and fight them right there. It's still ATB based so if you pick a command, a bar fills and once it fills, that command is issued. Exp and LP (license points) pop up above your enemy so you don't go to a separate screen. Only problem with this is that sometimes enemies overwhelm you and the EXP jumps rather considerably as you level up. In the first few enemy-infested levels you traverse, your requirements for levelling up can easily jump 300 exp and when each individual enemy has maybe 10 or so, that's a lot of fighting, and your Cure and whatnot don't come fast enough. The camera can cause problems, especially in dungeons where you went left instead of turning right.Like every single game since probably V, the game introduces a gameplay system on how to level and manage your characters. From the Materia system to Junctioning to the Sphere Grid, every game has had a different approach and it's the same thing here. The License board is essentially a re-worked Sphere Grid. Beating enemies in battle nets you License points which can be used to buy"" licenses, such as the ability to equip certain equipment or spells or enhancements such as increased potency of potions and spells or simply raising your strength and increasing your HP. However, just because you bought that license doesn't mean you can use it. Certain things like spells and skills have to be bought as well so buying the Cure license doesn't mean you can cast it, you have to buy it first. To be honest, this works better than X's system because unlike that system where you had to level up your health, strength, defense etc, individually, your traditional levelling up does it for you while the licenses are merely bonuses. However, there's no thieves/white mages-type thing here so you can actually make characters all equip bows if you wanted which takes away a bit of their uniqueness.The other addition is the Gambit system. Basically these are ""if commands"" which state that if a certain condition is there, an action is performed by your character. For example: if a character falls below a certain health percentage, your character or an ally will automatically perform Cure. If there's a fire-based enemy, you can have your ally automatically cast Blizzard. You can also set order preference so curing and health management take priority over attacking for example. Some say that it later makes the battles easier but personally it makes it funner and considering that they're all controllable, it's fun to not have to worry about them.Money has been changed as well. Enemies no longer carry vast amounts of Gil in their pocket, but instead they carry treasures. They can carry furs, stones and such and then those are sold in the market. Also you can take on various bounties where you hunt down a creature. It works in theory as well as just simple common sense(how is it that a bat carries Gil and what for anyway?), you don't get as much money as you should, especially considering you have to buy spells as well as techniques, weaponry, protective garments as well as supplies. As for the difficulty? It can get quite hairy. One early boss encounter pitted me up against at least 6 enemies, 2 of which were the main enemies and boy did they pack a wallop, finished me in 2 minutes flat. Party management and levelling are a must if you're to survive.I don't think there even is a Final Fantasy that's absolutely perfect but it's probably still going to be one of the more impressive RPG's you've played and XII is no different.""",5,"Well, here goes...",2006/11/6 0:00

Final Fantasy XII proves that this series can present an awesome storyline and graphics that all ages will adore.Don't worry if you haven't played all of the other Final Fantasy games. You don't need to. There are subtle carry-overs, but this game is meant to stand alone. You are a young orphan in a city recovering after a war. The cruel Empire has taken over your home town, and you enjoy causing trouble for the soldiers.Soon, of course, you're swept up in an epic rebellion. The storyline here is just *amazing*. Not just the plot itself, but the voice acting, the dialogue, the graphics, they are top notch. This is really like being a part of an extremely well done drama movie. They delve into issues of honor, loyalty, love, betrayal, and more. I'm an adult gamer, and I was staying up many long nights because I wanted to see where the story was going. Some of the subtle interactions between characters in cut scenes are just amazing. The small nods, the looks in their eyes, you are hard pressed to remember that they are animated in a computer game.Gameplay itself revolves around a party of characters going on quests, fighting in battles and moving through the large world. Each character gains experience and skills as they go. You buy them new weapons and armor, train them in spells, and aim them in their career growth however you wish. There is a dual system in play here. First, you need to physically own the weapon or item you wish to use - say an iron sword. But then you need to KNOW how to use it too! You can't just hand an iron sword to a 10 year old piano player and expect her to know how to use it. That skill is called a license"". You have an online license chart that lets you manage what each character knows. Licenses relate to each other. If your character learns the basics of sword work, now they can learn a more advanced version. It is very intuitive and adds a fun element to the game. It's not just one straight line that you choose and are stuck with. It's an all-directions layout where you can try new skills or expand out as you learn the system better.I really like combat in this Final Fantasy as well. Instead of random battles where enemies appear out of nowhere to assault you, all enemies are ""on the map"" with you. If you're running along a path in the desert and see something really scary in the distance, you run away from it! You don't have to worry about enemies springing up out of nowhere to slam you into the ground.The enemies in general are challenging but not impossible. There are spots where you really have to think about the enemy and what its weakness is to defeat it. You can't just brute force bash away at everything and hope to succeed.Still, as great as the gameplay is, and as gorgeous as the visuals and music and voice acting are, I really have to come back to the plot and characters as standing out here. There's been a lot of talk in the gaming world about a game that finally goes from ""little pixels on the screen"" that you move from X to Y to the point of *caring* about these characters, about what they are going through, and feeling emotional about their highs and lows. I really think Final Fantasy XII has hit that level. Yes, there are one or two twerpy characters that can be annoying. Even Star Wars had Luke whining about the Takashi Station at the beginning, to set his ""basis for growth"". In general, though, every single character here seems real, seems complex, and you don't want to put the game down.Highly, highly recommended.""",5,"Fantasic Storyline, Amazing Graphics, a Must Have",2006/11/21 0:00

Now, FF fanboys can rejoice at long last because FF XII is finally here in all it's glory, and not only is it the best game in the series since FF VII, it's one of the best RPG's on the PS2.  The storyline appears to be something we've seen time and time again: a ragtag group of freedom fighters become reluctant heroes to defeat their evil oppressors, but out of nowhere the story evolves and pulls you in like you won't expect, something that the last few game's in the series haven't done.  This is all seen with incredible cutscenes and surprisingly good voice acting to go along with some impressive graphics for a PS2 game, and the music score is excellently done as well.  As for the gameplay, there are some surprises for veteran fans of the series.  The random battles that went hand in hand with the title Final Fantasy are gone; replaced with battles that take place in context with the storyline.  Not to mention that the battle system is now more strategic and involving now than ever before, adding a new dimension to the turn based battle system that has been used so much it has become archaic.  If there's any negatives to FF XII, it's that the battle system takes some time to get used to, and there are times when exploring and re-tracing your footsteps becomes a chore, but other than that this installment in the long running series has quite a lot going for it: engaging story, lengthy quest, great graphics and sound, and well written and conceived characters.  All in all, though the PS2 may be going the way of the dodo, Final Fantasy XII is another game that is going to help it go out in style.",5,The best Final Fantasy game since VII,2006/11/1 0:00
A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000F5IH2I,S. Rhodes,278,243,"After a long wait, Final Fantasy XII is finally here, after such a long wait.  Everything about it shines.  From it's deep storyline, to its fantastic and complex gameplay.  All worries aside, Final Fantasy XII is a keeper.The Archadian Empire has taken over the Kingdom of Dalmasca.  The King has been assissnated and the princess is presumed dead.  The people of Dalmasca are displeased with the Empire, especially a young boy named Vaan who believes it is up to him to take Dalmasca back.  Luckily, he's not alone.  There's an entire resistence group out there that are willing to help him out.  The storyline of Final Fantasy XII is different from all the Final Fantasy games.  For one, it relies far more heavily on its political drama and philosophical intrigue.  What you get from Final Fantasy XII isn't a huge epic story in scope, but rather a drama that unfolds.  It's a different way to tell the story for Final Fantasy, but here it actually works.  It's still got some good twists and it is somewhat deep, but don't expect something along the lines of previous installments such as Final Fantasy X or VII.  It doesn't have the most memorable ensemble cast either, but you do, for the most part, like the characters.What many fans are most concerned about when it comes to this new installment is the battle system itself.  It strays away from the series roots. It is no longer the ATB style battles we've been used to since Final Fantasy IV.  Instead it's Active Dimension battle.  All enemies in any given area of a dungeon are present at all times and will charge you upon seeing you.You can free roam through any area, and so can your enemies.  As your characters approach an enemy they pull out their weapons and you can begin to issue attacks.  You can only play as one character at a time, but you can still issue orders to other characters if you want.  Since all enemies are present on the map at one time, running away can be a hassle.  Enemies will give chase, and some enemies will even join in the battle.The combat has a couple of downsides.  For one, getting money is downright painful and repetitive.  Your enemies don't drop money, and when they do it's not a lot.  Instead you'll be forced to sell the items they drop.  This wouldn't be a problem if stuff wasn't so expensive, and if the items dropped by enemies didn't sell for so little.  Also, dungeon maps are huge.  It's easy to get lost and overshoot your objective sometimes, even with the ingame map provided.This wouldn't be Final Fantasy without some complexity to the battle system, though.  First, there is the game's complex AI system called Gambits.""  Gambits allow you t customize what your characters do in battle.  You can set your characters up to attack, or you can get more complex and have them heal anyone whose HP falls below a certain percentile.  Once you get used to the Gambit system, however, it's really easy to take advantage of.  To the point where Final Fantasy XII becomes a cakewalk.  Even worse, if you set them up too well, you'll find that the only thing you ever have to do is move around the left analog stick.  It is entirely possible to track through Final Fantasy XII never having to open up the menu.Then there's the license point system.  As you battle through the game you'll earn license points which can be spent on the license board.  This helps to determine what spells, abilities and even weapon and armor characters can use.  Yes, that's right, weapons and armor.  You cannot use a certain weapon unless you have a ""license"" to do so.  There's nothing too complex about this and it suffers from its own little issue, the fact that in the end every character is the same.Let's be honest on one more thing... for some Final Fantasy XII just might not be a lot of fun to play.  The aspect of no random battles is nice, but take advantage of the gambit system, and Final Fantasy XII becomes a game that, for the most part, feels one-dimensional.  The complexity is nice, but gambits can make the player feel like he's doing little to participate.  What it amounts to is basically you moving around the left analog stick while your characters automatically carry out their own actions in battle.  There are times when Final Fantasy XII can feel monotonous as a result.  That's not to say you won't have fun, it's only to say that battling won't keep you as engaged for long.  Especially when every character can so easily learn everything.  The dungeons being so big doesn't help this.  They've made big so that you will battle.  And while the battle system isn't really bad in anyway, it can definitely be annoying to find that Square-Enix made a dungeon huge for the sake of padding out the length.Graphic-wise, Final Fantasy XII is fantastic.  The towns are detailed, and so are your characters.  The fact that each town has so many unique looking characters on screen at once is an impressive feat.  The game also sounds lovely.  Even better is the games artistic design.  Towns are breathtaking.  The game also sounds good.  The voice acting isn't the best in the world, but it does manage to be good in many areas.Perhaps Final Fantasy XII suffers most in the story department.  It's a good story, but the game doesn't spend a lot of time focusing on it.  It gets off to a great start, but at some point the game just becomes so devoid of it that it's easy to lose interest in what may have been one of the series more interesting stories.  Around the mid point of the game, the story takes a backseat, with developments coming further between.  It's refusal to focus too much on its characters doesn't help this.  It picks up again in the end and makes for a good story overall, but there's so much to Final Fantasy XII that just doesn't focus on it.  What makes the story good is how well written and how cinematic each of the cutscenes becomes.  When you get one of these in depth moments into the story it's really engaging and really good.  The problem is just that for so long this doesn't happen much.  The world of Ivalice is definitely beating with a pulse, though.  Running through towns and seeing the vast populations really brings things to life.  It's just a shame Final Fantasy XII couldn't have a more lively story.The Good+Fantastic Graphics+Good storyline+The new battle system is complex+Tons of side quests and secrets to keep you busy for hours+Beautiful soundtrack+Well done voicesThe Bad-Dungeons are huge and save points are few and far between-The battle system is too easy to take advantage of-The license board will eventually make every character the same-While the story is good overall, there certainly isn't too much focus on it""",4,One of Finer Fantasies,2006/10/31 0:00
A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B000F5IH2I,Winter,0,0,"There are some games that have trouble moving forward over the years:  either the type of game falls out of favor (like Adventure games did for a while) or the technology flies forward with no real way to adapt the old to the new.  Worst of all, being a sequel that comes from a long line of sequels can bring massive amounts of excess baggage from the game's predecessors that can't (or won't) be jettisoned.Having played many an RPG, I'm very pleased to say that Final Fantasy XII navigates smoothly around all these troubles. It does an excellent job of focusing on what matters most:  a rich Role-Playing Game experience that is also rather easy to use.  Having tried their hand at just about every variation of the genre, Square Enix gives us this culmination of lessons learned, and the end product is immersive, beautiful, and fun.Players used to the Final Fantasy series are also accustomed to having unique and complex capabilities as far as HOW they play.  If I were to start telling you about FFXII's Licenses, Gambits, Mists, and ESPers, chances are your head would spin--it's deep stuff.  In earlier titles like Final Fantasy VIII this was problematic:  the way you handled abilities and magical creatures who help you and special boosts to your weapons and stats was complicated and hard to keep track of.  Here however we have a smooth flow that slowly introduces you to the concepts and gives you a chance to try each one as you progress in the game.  Gameplay elements are better organized and not as dependent on each other.Perhaps one of the best features in the game is Gambits"":  instead of manually managing every character's every action in every turn, you can apply a certain amount of intelligence to your characters using multiple rules that you create.  This can easily be done.  For example, you can have your healer heal anyone when their health falls below 40%.  You can have a party member choose to attack the nearest enemies, or to focus on whichever enemy the leader is attacking.  You can tell a magic using character to throw certain spells based on certain events.  You can organize the Gambits to better automate actions: ""attack whatever the party leader is attacking.  Failing that, just attack the nearest enemy.""  And with one tap of a button, you can override these behaviors at any time.Another excellent feature is Licenses.  They represent a grid of all the possible skills a character can have, and they give you a seemingly infinite depth of choices for each player:  no longer do you have to choose narrow character types, like ""Mage"", ""Fighter"", ""Healer"".  Instead you simply choose how to spend points you accumulate to pick skills, spells, and equipment for each.  Naturally, this makes character mistakes easy to remedy, and it also means replaying the game can be a very different experience every time.There are other exciting features to the gameplay that would easily double the size of this review...so let's move on to the game elements themselves.  Probably the only real limitation to this game is that it was crafted for the PlayStation 2.  Cutscenes are stunningly gorgeous, but while the in-game graphics are among the best the PS2 had to offer, this still means things look a bit blocky, edges jagged and detail a bit muddied.  When you play, you will face loading screens that transition you from one area to another, but thankfully Square occasionally fills the gaps a bit with cinematic-style transition scenes.  Moving through the story brings characters who come and go:  some are guests you have no control over.  Others join with you and become playable characters you can control.  You even have allies who may change sides, and the next thing you know you're battling your own comerades in the fight to save the world.  My only complaint in this area is that you are only allowed to take 3 of your characters ""out of the box"" at a time.  You can change back and forth any time you like, even swapping out KO'd characters for live ones, but it would be a bit more fun for me if I could have 4 characters under my control instead of 3.Things don't stop there:  while we have gorgeous artwork, a beautifully orchestrated score, rich gameplay, and a complex system with an easy learning curve, we get the rest of the package, too:  great writing.  Interesting characters with diverse backgrounds, storylines that peg the dramatic moments and bring you along on the highs and lows of the story, drawing you in to a deep and at times very complicated plot.  There are political alliances and shadow arrangments, with people shifting sides as the story goes along.If you're interested in the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy XII is about as good as the later titles get.  If you're already familiar with the series from earlier titles, you might be pleasantly surprised at the amount of polish that has been put on this title.  If you're completely new to the RPG genre, expect this to be fairly complicated:  read the manual closely, pay attention to tutorials, and do a little reading online to immerse yourself.  I doubt you'll be disappointed.""",5,Pushing the PS2 Envelope,2010/2/22 0:00

FFVII:DoC feels very...boring.First off, the game is a bit too dark for my tastes. I understand the necessity for ambience and storytelling, but the fact is, I don't like dark games. Typically, they allow for the creators to be lazy in backgrounds, character designs, etc. And we have exactly this problem in DoC. The graphics hearken back to...The Bouncer? That game came out years ago! Moreover, the mission system (which I generally like in a game) is pretty boring as well, usually consisting of shoot enemy A before he causes calamity B. I would have liked more thinking involved (although that's a bit unfair as a criticism, since this is an Action Game"").Controls? They're OK, but it's a drag not having free-moving sights (you can only shoot at someone if you're locked onto them). It makes sniping too easy, and switching targets too hard.Storyline? It doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but I didn't see Advent Children. Still, a game should stand alone.All in all, this a fair diversion, and probably would have been worth twenty bucks, but fifty seems pricy for this fare...""",3,Bland and uninspired...,2006/8/18 0:00
A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000FDOTIQ,"Cloud ...""""",0,0,"Before Final Fantasy X-2, the series was mainly 2 things: the numbered series with no direct sequels, and the offshoots such as Tactics or Crystal Chronicles. Then X-2 comes along and we get a continuation of a Final Fantasy story, a series first. Well apparently since then, Square got in an excited mode and released their plan for the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII"". First was Advent Children, the CG movie that was well-liked but had its detractors. There was also Last Order, an anime style short, then there's Crisis Core and Before Crisis. Next is Dirge of Cerberus, which focuses on Vincent Valentine. It's not that it's a terrible game per se, it's just that everything that's not the actual gameplay itself works.Story: Set 3 years after Meteorfall(when Sephiroth summoned the Meteor but was destroyed by Holy and the Lifestream), there's a new group of enemies known as Deepground and they seem to be after civilians. It's up to Vincent as well as some cameos and appearances by his friends as well as new ones and enemies to figure what's the connection between the disappearing civilians and Omega.Graphics: I'll simply state it: the FMV's are just simply gorgeous. Taking the lushness of the scenes from X with the fluidity and character detail of Advent Children and it makes a gorgeous background for the story. The in-game grpahics? Well not so much. While it's nice to see VII's locations in full 3D, there's a kind of blandness to it all. The in-game cutscenes though are nice and similar to X's look and feel.Sound/Music: It's a very um...pretty soundtrack. There's many tracks here that are really nice to listen to. There's no real One Winged Angel or anything, that instant downloadable track but they're fairly easy to listen to. The voice acting is slight hit and miss. Vincent personally sounds way too gruff and I've never liked Cid or Cait Sith's accents. It does however contain nice work from Christy Carlson Romano(yes the Disney girl) as Yuffie and Lucrecia by April Stewart.Gameplay: Essentially Cerberus is like a cross between Resident Evil 4 and Devil May Cry. You move Vincent around a 3D environment and pressing R1 will bring up a targeting area and you can use that to aim and shoot. Unlike RE4, you can actually run which seriously helps. Enemies pack quite a wallop, especially those machine gun wielding guys and your health can drain fast. You can turn into a demon using a Limit Break item and get more enhanced powers. The big problem is that the radar kind of sucks. Enemies have incredibly aim and they can easily nail you from a mile away and you can't tell where they are. The other major hiccup, besides the general stagnant feeling of the combat, is the items. Throughout the entire game, you're only allowed a specific number of items and you can easily drain your entire health meter before you even come close to another item vendor(oddly enough, it's a jukebox).Is it a difficult game? Well it probably feels easy at times but then you find trouble spots. Like I said, enemies can pack quite a wallop and your health can go down considerably fast and when you're only allowed to carry 2 hi-potions, it gets really frustrating when you're overwhelmed. Speaking of which, there's many times in the game where you take on at least 6-7 soldiers by yourself, and you feel like ""well that isn't fair"". What does get points is the story. Seeing old characters is always great and the story is kind of interesting. In particular, the backstory between Vincent and Lucrecia is wonderfully fleshed out, making her a bigger presence(plus she's so cute). Only problem with the story is at times it doesn't make sense while other times it feels like an extension of Final Fantasy X. Maybe it's the presentation but it didn't really feel like VII, it felt like VII using an X template, if that makes sense...probably doesn't.Should you buy it? If you're a HUGE Final Fantasy fan then go for it. As for everyone else, not really. It's a fine rental, which is kind of sad really.""",3,I hate when others are right,2006/10/29 0:00
A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000FDOTIQ,"Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...""",60,52,"In an odd twist, the Final Fantasy series has gone backwards"" to expand on Final Fantasy VII. Latching onto a minor character - Vincent Valentine - we now find out what happened 3 years later.Vincent is older than the typical Final Fantasy Teen character - more along the lines of Auron from FFX. He loves to dramatically swirl his cape as he moves. He is dark, brooding, and ruthlessly efficient in his attacks. I like all of this.The cut scenes are simply *gorgeous* at times.  The movements of characters is just amazing. The small motions, the emotions shone, this is a work of art.Unfortunately, given these great achievements, the actual gameplay really doesn't hold up well for me. I understand that this is not a RPG - it is a combat game. You go around attacking enemies, little numbers of damage bounce over their heads, and you reduce them to zero. The ""world"" is a Final Fantasy world, but it's not really a Final Fantasy game. It's about building up gun components, shooting, and then shooting some more. Puzzles involve getting cards to get through doors, and figuring out how to kill enemies.The in game graphics are much less impressive than the cut scenes. Your character is reduced to jumping and walking. There's no diving, rolling, or other special moves. Even worse, there are incredibly numerous long pauses as you go between gameplay and cut scene. There must have been a better way to integrate those quickly, especially as many of the cut scenes are just brief little ""thank you""s.Also, while I know Vincent is a dark, brooding type - a type that appeals to me a lot, by the way - I find him a bit too uncaring about the people around him. He seems often to get involved reluctantly. He almost seems to dismiss some people as being beneath his notice. This isn't a kind of hero I appreciate.In general, as much as I tried to get into this new style of game, it just didn't work very well. There are many other combat style games that involve characters that can creep, roll, dive and use great combat moves. With Vincent doing these things in cut scenes, he should be able to do them in actual gameplay as well.""",3,Amazing cut scenes and main character - but not well developed,2006/9/2 0:00
AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000FDOTIQ,"N. Durham Big Evil""""",1,1,"The mysterious Vincent Valentine was one of the most interesting and memorable characters from the classic Final Fantasy VII, which is one reason why this spin-off looked so promising.  Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus is less RPG and more action/shooter, taking place after the events of Final Fantasy VII.  Vincent seeks to learn more about his mysterious past as he attempts to stop a group called Deepground from destroying the world; all of this is told through cut-scenes aplenty, which in themselves are pretty to look at (and some look very similar to the Advent Children film), but there are too many, and the loading times before and after really slow down the gameplay.  Running and gunning isn't always a bad thing, but it gets so trite here which is a crying shame for all the potential this game had.  Many of the enemies are generic and repetitive, but the gameplay does get spiced up occasionally when you get the chance to change into one of Vincent's alternate, monstrous forms and dish out some punishment.  Most of the areas are nicely done, and will look instantly familiar to longtime FF VII fanboys, and the bonuses that get unlocked once you beat the game are a nice touch as well.  However, the overall feeling of Dirge of Cerberus is that it's just a generic shooter.  It's nothing bad, but considering it's pedigree, Dirge of Cerberus is very disappointing, but it's still worth a look for FF VII fans who just can't get enough and want more to the story.",3,"Yawn, should have been better",2006/8/30 0:00
A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B000FDOTIQ,"Richard Baker BinaryMessiah""""",0,0,"The Good: Great graphics, reveals all the questions around Vincent, fast paced action, great final levelThe Bad: Only 3 weapons, limited customization, poorly balanced, highly linear, story is confusing for non-FF7 players, bland level design, offers almost no challengeThis is one of those games that Final Fantasy fans don't want to admit they played. It got a lot of hype when it came out because it was a shooter set in the FF universe, that's very odd and abstract from the typical JRPG formula. Many people didn't have high hopes for it since Japanese gamers don't really play shooters, but I passed it up due to the flack and poor reviews it got. It came out at the tail end of the PS2 life cycle and was overlooked by the hype of the next generation and many other games coming out. This was one of the projects for the Final Fantasy VII extension. This game tells the story behind Vincent Valentine and how he came to be and delves deeper into his relationship with Lucrecia, the FF7 team, Hojo, and a few other characters. Honestly the story is very confusing unless you have played FF7 already, in fact, all the FF7 projects make no sense unless you have played the PS1 classic. I never played it as a kid so the story made no sense. Even if I had, it's pretty dry and dull and uninteresting until the very end. Vincent doesn't really say too much and the story is poorly edited and feels chopped up and mixed around.The action is at least half-way decent and pretty fun. You get three different guns in the whole game, a pistol, machine gun, and sniper rifle. You can customize these weapons with different barrels, materia for magic, and various other effects. It's nice to see this in an FF game, but the customization feels very limited due to the limited gun types. Like a Final Fantasy game you can use various potions, limit breakers, and phoenix downs which revive you when you die. The game has the Final Fantasy vibe all around it, but the action part is lacking greatly. It feels fast paced and snappy, but the game is linear to a fault and offers almost no challenge. I blew through boss after boss without even dying or losing much health. Once you level your weapon parts up enough you are unstoppable early on. You chew through enemies like candy and there is just a huge lack of challenge. There are a few turret sections, a couple of cinematic on-rails segments, and that's about it. 90% is running around the same bland environments shooting the same bland enemies for 6 hours.There is some melee combat thrown in, but it's very weak. Just a quick 3-hit combo, but when you are in beast form you are more powerful using melee attacks. There's items scattered all over the place and hidden items for extra endings and whatnot. It's the same dated shooter stuff with keycards to open gates, button pressing, and other dated shooting mechanics. The game is only fun because the environments change up a lot, but they are still bland no matter what. The enemies repeat often and this really weakens the game. The hallways can be so small that they are the width of Vincent himself which just feels restricting. On top of all that, the game is just poorly balanced. I stuck with the pistol through the whole game because switching up weapons isn't really necessary because the game is so easy. The final level is really awesome because Vincent is in Chaos form and you are mega powerful, but it's all a ruse to JRPG players who aren't veterans in shooters. You can tell this game was geared toward casual players and really just FF fans. The confusing story is evidence to that.Overall, Dirge of Cerberus is a fun weekend rental but nothing more. Non Final Fantasy fans won't really care for this because there are much better shooters on the PS2 that offer more depth and better stories. Final Fantasy players won't really like it because it's too action heavy and gives a false sense as to how shooters really play out. It tries to run a middle ground and veers off constantly with no real direction. A few months months of polish would have done this game some good. It's a nice departure from the series and an interesting side project. It doesn't really fail, but rides on the borderline of being a bad shooter.",3,Not as bad as everyone says,2013/10/1 0:00
A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000FDOTIQ,S. Rhodes,101,91,"The unfortunate thing about Dirge of Cerberus is that it has the curse of being in the universe of one of the greatest and most beloved video games of all time:  Final Fantasy VII.  There's no way Dirge of Cerberus could possibly stack up to Final Fantasy VII.  To expect any spinoff to stack up to the original Final Fantasy VII name and legacy is unrealistic.  Dirge of Cerberus is pretty different... for Final Fantasy, that is. For your basic shooter, though, it's really not that different from any other shooter.A group of underground soldiers known as Deepground have plans to revive the dreaded Omega Weapon.  In order to do that, however, they need Vincent Valentine.  Throughout the game you'll play as Vincent Valentine, getting to the bottom of this mystery.  The gold of the story is that it provides quite an interesting look into Vincent's past.  There are moments when the story feels a little complicated, but it's still a good experience nonetheless.Dirge of Cerberus isn't really an RPG.  Square refers to it as an RPG Shooter,"" but in reality, it's really just a shooter.  The game has a rather simple formula for its missions.  You'll view a cutscene that introduces you to the level.  The cutscene is usually long, and you'll have to wait for it to load first, and then you'll have to wait for it to load after its over.  Then you'll go into said level and blast everything and anything that moves.  Then at the end of each level you'll fight a boss.  Rinse and repeat.  Every stage in the game is pretty straightforward.  All you need to do is keep shooting at virtually anything that moves.  In some missions there are other things you can do, but really, you don't have to do these optional events.  They're just there so you can improve your score.  The basic goal of just about every mission is to kill stuff.A lot of these levels feel a little uninspired.  Most of them are bland looking with not much of anything for you there.  You can't tear apart the environment or anything like that.  It's also sad that a lot of areas in some levels look the same.  These stages don't really show you a lot of variety in the environment.  You'll also find yourself visiting some pretty familiar areas like Midgar.  When you visit most of these familiar areas, however, you don't really feel like you're revisiting anything in Final Fantasy VII.  Also, you'll mostly find yourself in the sewers or something.  It's also really sad that you can't explore more of the world.  The game is set in such a linear path that you can't explore your surroundings.Going through most of these levels isn't always bad.  Most of the action isn't all it's cracked up to be.  You simply aim and shoot.  The game provides a nice targetting system that makes missing most enemies nearly impossible.  Even worse for the gameplay, there aren't a whole lot of variety with the enemies themselves.  You'll mostly battle soldiers.  Though from time to time you'll battle other things such as mechs and dogs.  Once you've seen one soldier, though, you've seen them all.  They're downed within a couple of shots, and their attack patterns aren't really all that varied.  Before long, the enemies will do the same predictable things they always do.  The game becomes incredibly easy before it even gets a chance to get hard.  When you're near the end of the game, the enemies will still have their same old attack patterns.  They never ever change.  Bosses can be tough, but the only thing that actually makes the bosses tougher than your normal enemy is that they have more health.In addition, most levels have little in-game cutscenes of their own.  Again, though, you have to wait for the cutscene to load and then wait for it to load when it's over.  These moments wouldn't be so bad if they didn't constantly come in the middle of the action.  One minute you're shooting up your enemies, the next the game is loading a cutscene that might only last for a minute, and then the next your back in the middle of the action.  It isn't that these moments are bad, it's just that they're inserted at inappropriate times.Using magic also has its own hits and misses.  You can equip materia to your weapon and fire off a magic shot.  This adds some variety to the stale gameplay, but you'll end up depleting your MP really fast.  There's not enough of the magic to go around.  Likewise, you'll find items called Limit breakers which will allow you to use Vincent's limit break for a limited amount of time.  Using Vincent's limit break provides some more fun to the game.  You'll get to rip most of your enemies to shreds, but unfortunately, it only adds more ease to the game.  Even bosses become a cakewalk with the limit break.  Even though it only lasts for a limited amount of time, you'll still be able to take down a boss using the limit break.Weapon customizing is a nice addition, however.  After each level you have a chance to use the gil you've earned from enemies to upgrade Vincent's weapons.  Throughout most of the game you'll be using the Cerberus, though.  It's by far the most potent weapon in the game.  It's nice to be able to explore and customize a vareity of weapons at least.Dirge of Cerberus isn't a long game.  It may take you less than ten hours to complete it.  Upon completing it, though, you unlock an abundance of extra missions and such.  The standard game is nothing special, but the extra missions can really keep you busy for a while.  They're a lot more fun than the standard missions, and ask a lot more of your skills.Graphically, it's hard to judge Dirge of Cerberus.  Most of the environments are pretty run of the mill for the genre.  There's not a lot of vareity or interaction with anything in these levels.  Most levels really aren't that impressive looking.  On the other hand, the pre-rendered cutscenes are beautiful to look at.  These cutscenes themselves look just as good as the movie Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children.  Outside of that, however, Dirge of Cerberus doesn't take the PS2 to its full capacity.  Most of the music is alright.  Nothing great, but good enough nonetheless.  The voice acting is pretty standard.  Not a lot of emotion, but at some points it goes along with the dark mood of the game rather well.  Sometimes the characters not having emotion is what makes the voice acting good at some parts of the game.  On the whole, though, it's not fantastic voice acting.Dirge of Cerberus isn't really a bad game, but outside of it having the Final Fantasy name on it, there's really nothing in this game that sets it apart from other shooters and action/adventure titles.  The Final Fantasy name is the only real reason to get this game.  It's interesting to learn about Vincent, and to expand upon the Final Fantasy VII universe, but perhaps Final Fantasy should stick strictly to the RPG genre.The Good+You get to play as Vincent Valentine+Vincent's past and story is explained rather well; the overall storyline of the game is pretty well done+Beautiful pre-rendered cutscenes+Neat weapons customization+You get to use Vincent's Limit Break+Tons of extra missions after the game is completedThe Bad-Little innovation-In game graphics are not up to standard for the PS2 or Square-Enix for that matter-Poor voice acting in many spots-Environments are bland-There isn't enough vareity to the enemies, they do the same thing over and over until the end of the game-The gameplay gets stale... fast-The stages lack variety and exploration; they're all linear paths-There's little challenge to the game""",3,Final Fantasy Should Remain in the RPG Realm,2006/8/17 0:00

A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000FO4KO8,"Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...""",4,3,"We owned an original Nintendo DS for two years - we bought it right when it released in December 2004. When I first saw the DS Lite at E3 in 2006, I was thrilled. The game great handheld unit design - but lighter! Brighter! Tuned! It really showed that Nintendo had been paying attention to customer feedback during those two years, and had tweaked its unit to be even better than before.First, the weight. We always *loved* the design of the DS, with its folding top. As PSP owners, I can't tell you how many time that poor PSP screen gets dinged or scratched. We had to buy extra carrying cases for our PSP and get screen protectors. In comparison, the DS's clamshell design means the screen is perfectly protected when you tote it around in your pocket or purse. The only down-side was that it was a bit heavy. With the DS lite, they keep the protection of the clamshell and also lighten up the unit significantly. It really does help a lot.The screen brightness - with it being *adjustable* - is an incredibly helpful update. Sometimes you're playing outside in very bright light. Sometimes you're playing in full dark, staying awake in bed. There are all levels in between. If you need that brightness, you don't care if you're burning up your battery power. If you do NOT need that brightness, why kill your battery for no reason? Having that ability to adjust really means that your battery works as best as it possibly can.We play several games that use the microphone, like Brain Age, and it definitely helps to have it in the center. Usually you're holding the unit with both hands, centered on your face. To have your mouth pointed right at the microphone helps out greatly with those games.In general the DS system is a fantastic handheld gaming system. We have both the DS and PSP and we play both frequently. Many of the games on the DS aren't available on the PSP and are a ton of fun. The Brain Age / Big Brain Academy / similar games stand out as games we enjoy daily. There are many other games that use the DS touch screen extremely well, giving a full interactivity of gameplay. Yes, the PSP has better graphics. It's something that the DS compromised on. They have less detailed graphics, but more interactivity. Both are great for the games they offer. So for example we play flight simulator style games on our PSP, where the high end graphics matter, and we play puzzle / platform / thinking games on the DS, where the interactivity and plot is more key.I highly recommend the DS Lite for anybody who doesn't have a DS yet - whether you have a PSP or not. It's not an either-or situation. It's like having a stereo and a TV set. They're both great for their own reasons, and most people would enjoy having both.If you HAVE a Nintendo DS already and are wondering if you should get a Lite, it really depends on how much you use it away from home. The primary benefit here is the lighter carrying weight, smaller size and much better battery life. If you're carrying it in your pocket, purse or backpack every day, I would really recommend getting a Lite. You can always give your original DS away to a friend or relative as a present, or sell it on eBay. The DSs are still in high demand and would be much loved by a new recipient.",5,Fantastic Value in a Gaming System,2006/12/21 0:00

With Nintendo, they absolutely have delivered with the success of the Wii and the DS. But, last year, they've made a shocking decision to finally end their run with longtim success of the Game Boy franchise after nearly 20 years of success. Still, Nintendo has found a new system that delivers just as well. back in 2004, Nintendo launched the DS, which won a whole new audience of gamers who love the way we use the stylus and innovation of gameplay. Since then, it absolutely has changed the way we play video games on the go. Now, it has once again gone blue, 4 years after the original Nintendo DS release.The Nintendo DS Lite in Colbalt and Black, is a new way we see the essence of blue, with this blue-colored look of the system, that appeals to boys and the seductive color of girls' eyes too. The system is sleek and easy to play all your favorite Nintendo DS games and also your Game Boy Advance titles like Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Brothers 3 on the go. The system also includes a much longer battery life than the original DS system, and is easy to charge up. The look of the games is even better than the original DS on all your favorite titles like New Super Mario Brothers, Nintendogs and Brain Age 2. You can also compete against other gamers online through Nintendo's Wi-Fi connection for special titles through a wireless connection with ease. The price is also affordable at $129, unlike those other hard to get systems like the Playstation 3 or the Wii, so anyone who wants to buy a video game system whether it is on a budget, or if you trust the Nintendo brand can get this great system.All in all, I love the Nintendo DS Lite in Cobalt and Black is a great video game system for gamers of all ages. I absolutely recommend this great handheld system because it is well worth the purchase, and it will keep you gaming for years to come.

Since it's original release, the DS was a step above the long running GameBoy with it's inventive features, and Nintendo has once again provided a list of superb first party titles.  This latest incarnation of the DS, the DS Lite, shrinks the once clunky sized system down and re-shuffles the microphone and power buttons making the hand held easier to operate than ever before, while also making the screens bigger and brighter.  As for the system's game library, it's getting better and better as the weeks go on and we see games like New Super Mario Bros., Metroid Prime: Hunters, Mario Kart, Animal Crossing, Tetris DS, Meteos, Sonic Rush, and the upcoming new Zelda game and Final Fantasy III; both of which are sure to be smashes, as well as a nice sized list of games to avoid for the DS (such as Marvel Nemesis, Splinter Cell, King Kong, and Kim Possible) as publishers and developers both decide to make use of the DS's stylus and touch screen abilities, or just ignore them in general.  The DS Lite is hands down the best hand held system on the market right now, and is incredibly affordable (for the price of a PSP, you can buy a DS Lite and at least two games), and even though there are reports of a cracking of the system's outer piece, the DS Lite is still the hand held to buy.",5,The best hand held on the market today,2006/7/23 0:00

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000FO4KO8,S. Rhodes,1185,1131,"People will no doubt find the Nintendo DS Lite to be a way for Nintendo to sucker people out of their money. It can be that way, if you think of yourself as a sucker, but for me the DS lite is a little better. Simply put, if you're content with your original DS, then don't even waste time to buy this one. If you don't have a DS period, the DS Lite is a much better investment than the original bulky one.With the DS Lite, gameplay is made a little simplar. The button placement and brighter screen make the gameplay a little better. For one, the start and select buttons have been moved to resemble where they were on the original Gameboy Advance. This makes handling some of the functions (especially for GBA games) a lot easier. The buttons, sadly, are a still a little small for guys with big hands like myself.The DS Lite also comes with a phony GBA cartridge (called a cap""). If you don't have a GBA game plugged into the system, you can put in the phony cartridge to keep it from collecting dust in there. However, when you do stick in a GBA game, it sticks out by about a centimeter. It just looks weird. The cap does, at least, keep the system looking good.Perhaps the most welcome change to the DS Lite is the screen. The original DS screen was not exactly bright. In fact, it was, in comparison the DS Lite, rather dark. Games like Metroid Prime Hunters were darker than they had to be. On this new screen, the difference in how bright the games appear really shows. Not only that but, you can adjust the brightness if need be. It doesn't really affect the battery life, either. You can play the DS Lite for as long as you played the original. And also like the original, it charges while you play.Another welcome difference is the touch screen itself. These screens last a lot longer than the original DS. Those who have an original DS no doubt experienced a lot of scratches on their screen from their stylus. To the point where it was noticeable. You could still see the screen, but it was apparent that the stylus was doing a number on it. The screen is more protected here. The stylus doesn't scratch the screen quite as easily. In other words, the touch screen lasts a lot longer.The DS Lite also looks better, and fits in your pocket better. It also performs all the tasks of a regular DS. For example, if you're playing a game and you suddenly have to go, just flip it closed and it sleeps. There's also a place to store the stylus, and the stylus is better too. It's a little bigger and thicker, so it's not quite as easy to lose.Some problems with the original DS still plague the DS Lite however. You still can't play Gameboy Color or regular Gameboy games on the DS Lite. Also, you still can't configure the controls to play a GBA game much easier. In other words you can't configure ""X"" and ""Y"" when you play a GBA game. This probably won't bother you in the long run, however. Also, the touch screen still has its sensitivity. Touching the touch screen with your bare hands is more dangerous than the stylus scratching the screen. The oils from your fingers might damage the screen and therefore, it won't respond to the touch of even your stylus.When the original DS launched, owners will note that there were not very many good games availible. About the only good game during its launch in 2004 was Super Mario 64 DS. Now there are plenty of games out there (and not all of them are ports), so if you do want a DS, this is a great time to get one, and the DS Lite is a better investment than the original one by far.The DS may not play movies, or MP3 players, but to be honest, that almost defeats the purpose of a gaming system. Am I looking to buy a portable entertainment center? Of course not, I'm looking to find a system to play some of my games on, and the Nintendo DS delivers. Real gamers know it's about the games, not about the bells and whistles of a system. For the casual gamer, the Nintendo DS delivers, and the DS Lite is a fine improvement.The Good+Vastly superior to the original DS+It fits in your pocket easier+The Screen is much brighter+Touch screen is more durable+The placement of the Start and Select buttons is easier+A better stylus+The battery life is unchangedThe Bad-Those with an original DS, who want a DS Lite will have to spend more money for yet another DS-Some of the cons of the original DS are still here""",4,Lighter is Better,2006/8/31 0:00

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000FQ2D5E,"Cloud ...""""",3,3,"Trailers and screenshots come up which send fans into a frenzy about the next installment in the long-running and successful Metal Gear Solid franchise. With new hardware, more ambitious storyline and gameplay changes, many heavily hyped up the next chapter in the series. However, the game in the end became known as being graphically beautiful but ridiculous in its plotline and over-the-top to the extreme. That game was Sons of Liberty"", the second game in the series released for the Playstation 2. Its sequel/prequel ""Snake Eater"" improved some of the storyline indulgences and introduced some key gameplay ideas and it ended up being my favorite of the 3 on the Playstation systems. How does the fourth, ""Guns of the Patriots"" fare? Well it repeats many of the blunders the second one did but it's even more epic and ambitious than any of them so go figure.Story: Taking place a few years after the Plant Incident of ""Sons of Liberty"", we find Snake has been aging rapidly thanks to some unknown problem. He's been hunting for Liquid, now completely taking control of Revolver Ocelot's body. With military companies at his disposal and new and powerful threats, Snake has to join up with old friends in order to finally take down Liquid and the control over the group known as the ""Patriots"".To spoil any more than that would cause a great disservice since, by completely avoiding plot spoilers and explanations, the storyline's many changes and twists were all the more shocking and thrilling. Similar to the second game, the trailers and screenshots showing the Middle East is just tip of the iceberg as there is way more locales and things to do where you'll go around the world to track down and stop Liquid. While there's moments are thrilling, it's the inbetween that will make one recall the chattiness of ""Sons of Liberty"" and you'll literally at times put down your controller and not pick it up for at least 20 minutes to half an hour. While anyone who's played any of the previous games aren't in for a surprise that way, be warned this game is quite lengthy in its storyline and just as ambitious/excessive as before.Graphics: ""Guns of the Patriots"" was one of the first games that I played on the Playstation 3 hooked up to an HDTV and even running at 720p, I have to say this game is absolutely gorgeous. From remarkably detailed character animation to the direction of the cutscenes, anyone hooked up to a high end set will be in for a real treat. And it's no longer burdened by jungles or industrial plants in its locales and many look quite stunning. The in-game graphics look just as well as they're more polished and beefed up though if you've played Snake Eater, imagine a more enhanced look of that.Sound/Music: It's often been said that the MGS series has always been in line with Hollywood blockbusters so of course we get Harry Gregson-Williams to provide the score, who did scores Spy Kids, Shrek 2, Team America: World Police and Kingdom of Heaven. With heavy orchestral numbers and big bombast in its sound, anyone with their machine hooked up to a stereo will be in for a good one. And of course we have the voice acting which continues its top form (though Otacon's whining is still grating) and the frequent voiceovers and even ingame flashback clips are quite welcome.Gameplay: This is that part where I say MGS has always been more watched than played most of the time. The gameplay is relatively unchanged from the rations to the weapons to CQC so it's quite easy to just go and play. Introduced though is the Drebin Store where the character you meet in the game provides your own weapon and ammo purchases where they can be customized or restocked with ammo. While some feel this makes the game easier, it works well when you're taking on a big beast (such as the Metal Gear offshoots ""Gekko"") and have to get more missiles for your launcher. But it sucks you can't purchase noodles or rations and when you're in the middle of a big boss fight and you haven't come across any health items in awhile, it gets a bit annoying. Similar to the camouflage in ""Snake Eater"", Snake this time has what's called the OctoCamo which basically acts as a chameleon-like suit that mimics the pattern of whatever you press up against or lie down on. It's a lot more handy than changing your suit in the menu and isn't quite as burdensome. There's many more gameplay changes from just controlling Old Snake in its familiar form though I'll leave that to you to uncover.One thing I always never liked about the series is the times when playing borders on frustration and you're sent a trip to the Continue screen because of some little mistake you didn't even think would get you caught. A couple of other times I'd get very annoyed since I knew what to do but actually pulling it off was a thing in of itself. The storyline and presentation are certainly high-caliber but the gameplay can get seriously patience-trying.With many, many secrets to unlock from FaceCamo to dolls to iPod songs to emblems, MGS will keep many a fan busy who are into 100% completion. While I still find Snake Eater my favorite, Guns of the Patriots is certainly one of the best games available for the PS3.""",5,Cinematic indulgence at its finest,2008/8/1 0:00

A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000FQ2D5E,"Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...""",76,37,"The final installment of Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear"" series has a lot to live up to. Besides its innovations in gameplay, Metal Gear Solid 4 has to worry about wrapping up and connecting the stories of 5 different Metal Gear games. As such, this long-awaited finale has its work cut out for it, but does it pull it off?The story in this game is all but impenetrable if you haven't played every other game in the series, including the PSP-only Portable Ops. The game relies heavily on references and flashbacks from old games to tell its story, drawing from every other game to wrap up the series as a finished product. As a result, people who haven't played any of the games in the series before would do well to avoid the game and perhaps get the MGS Essential Collection for the PS2 first.The new theme in this Metal Gear Solid game is ""the battlefield"". Working against mercenaries employed by various Private Military Companies, you attempt to sneak (or fight) through warzones as the PMCs engage rebel and militia forces. Instead of the simpler and quieter job of sneaking through areas where your enemies are not engaged, you must instead brave gunfire from either side and avoid being detected. In many areas it's possible to aid the rebels by attacking PMCs; since the PMCs are always your enemies, it's useful to have people on your side who are fighting them. Doing so will make the rebels friendly to you and make your job easier. If you choose to attack the rebels, or not fight the PMCs, you'll have a tough time moving through rebel-controlled areas as well as PMC-controlled areas because both sides will be hostile towards you. Your participation in the battle is not required, though depending on your style of play, the game may get easier or harder depending on how you ""use"" the rebels. There are many pitched battles in the game, often involving armored vehicles and heavy weapons being used by both sides, with artillery raining down from above. Atmospherically, these sections definitely have the feel of a dangerous warzone, where any cover can be destroyed and an ambush can come from any side.Your main tool to avoid enemies is OctoCamo. A development of the camouflage system in MGS3, OctoCamo blends in automatically with any background you press against, granting you near-invisibility in almost any setting. Defeating the game's first boss grants you a mask addition that allows you to either camouflage your face (increasing your invisibility even further) or put on masks of human faces to use as disguises (it's purely a cosmetic change, though). Furthermore, there are certain uniforms that allows you to blend in with the crowds of militiamen and rebels and reduces the likelihood that Snake will personally be spotted. It also makes an ally out of any rebels that you happen to meet, since they assume you're on their side.Another item introduced in the game is the Solid Eye, a multipurpose ""eyepatch"" that allows you an extra heads-up display over your regular one. This HUD highlights items for you to collect, adds informative statistics to NPCs within range (specifically things like their mental status, health, and how they feel about you).  Furthermore, it also includes a binocular and night-vision/thermal vision mode, both of which are useful at spotting enemies at long range.There are two ""health"" bars in the game - the first represents physical health, while the second represents your state of mind. Being in stressful situations, such as being pursued, being shot at, or having killed a lot of enemies, will raise your stress a great deal and lower your state of mind. The lower your ""psyche"" bar is, the less accurately you will shoot, and furthermore Snake will breathe heavily and move sluggishly. The health bar is restored by items like rations, while the psyche bar is recovered either through certain food items or by staying out of combat for a certain amount of time to gather your wits. The Psyche bar may be a relatively annoying development, based on how you play; if you are a gung-ho soldier who intends to run around and shoot everything, then the psyche bar will hinder you fairly often. If you avoid combat, move slowly, and don't get caught in major fights, it isn't much of a problem.Weapons in this game are handled differently than previous games. In the past, weapons had to be found ""clean"" - you couldn't take weapons from enemies, but instead had to find them in certain areas at different parts of the game. In MGS4, a new character called Drebin is introduced. Drebin is a gun launderer - in exchange for ""Drebin Points"" accumulated by selling him weapons found on the battlefield, Drebin will remove the personal ID of any gun you find, which will allow you to use the formerly locked weapon. He will also sell you guns and ammo directly, though this tends to be more expensive. The sheer number of weapons is far greater than any other Metal Gear game: pistols, submachine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, machine guns, rocket launchers, grenade launchers, and anti-tank missiles are all included in the game's arsenal. The weapons in this game are in many cases customizable with a variety of items, including scopes, silencers, grips, laser sights, flashlights, and a wide variety of ammunition, both lethal and non-lethal. The effect of both the shop and the number of available weapons is to remind you that you are in a warzone, not a clean sneaking environment. As such, combat is often much more frantic and intense, and justifies the use of an RPG or a guided anti-tank missile.The new gameplay and controls in the game have mostly been improved. Instead of previous MGS games' overhead camera, MGS4 allows either an auto-aim or a third person over-the-shoulder shooting scheme. The option for first person also exists, using scopes or iron sights. The over-the-shoulder camera should be familiar to anyone who's played Resident Evil 4, and is one of the most helpful additions, gameplay-wise, to the game. Snake can aim either from the right or from the left, which helps when peeking out around corners. The controls are different, but primarily intuitive. The option exists to press against certain walls, either to hide out of someone's line of sight or to blend in with OctoCamo. This also allows for the ability to lean out into doorways to shoot at enemies, a refined version of the ability used in MGS2 and MGS3.In less gun-related combat, CQC has been brought over from MGS3, and for the most part it is the same. For some reason, it feels less smooth in operation, however. The option to hold enemies at gunpoint if they are caught unaware has been upgraded; instead of the somewhat nonsensical ""point your gun at enemies and they will shake items out of their bodies"" that previous games had, MGS4 goes with a more realistic ""body check"" as Snake pats down his enemies for weapons and ammunition. CQC and holding enemies up both can cause enemies to drop their weapons, unlike in previous games where enemies would hold on to their rifles and riddle you with bullets as soon as you dropped your guard. The items all feel much more realistic, and there are no more ""floating item boxes"". Some items are still contained in large boxes, but at the very least they no longer float and rotate anymore.The main problem with the game, in terms of gameplay, is that there isn't enough of it. The game is divided into five acts. The first two are as I described above: fighting through a warzone populated by PMCs with the help of rebels. However, from the third act onwards, these features disappear. Only the first two acts of the game are really identifiable as ""MGS4"", while the rest is like a different game that uses MGS4's gameplay and engine. Act 3 has you tailing an informant through a PMC-controlled city, Act 4 consists almost entirely of fighting robots and unmanned vehicles, and Act 5 consists of only two areas.For the most part, the game feels like wrestling with the cutscenes and story for control of the game. So many things happen in cutscenes that should have been done as actual gameplay sections. In fact, there are two cutscenes that occur while you are doing a gameplay segment, forcing you to rapidly move your eyes back and forth to the sides of the screen if you want to see what's going on in the cutscene. One character, returned from a previous game as a buffed-up cyborg ninja, has fight scenes that only occur in cinematics, and he never fights alongside you in actual gameplay. The sheer number and length of the cutscenes is overwhelming, as well. Early on I was willing to forgive it because MGS4 did have a lot of loose ends to tie up, but by the end it seems like unnecessary things were added or put in just so it would seem more like a Hollywood-style movie. I beat the game in 20 hours, and I estimate a third or a fourth of that was spent watching cutscenes. To be fair, they are well-directed and good overall, but they're just overwhelmingly long and poorly paced. The ending, for example, takes a good hour to complete, at least. Especially when you consider how many cutscenes would translate fine to regular gameplay, it seems way too excessive.The bosses of the game - the ""Beauty and the Beast"" unit - are also somewhat disappointing. All four are meant to be shadows of earlier bosses - combining the animal names of FOXHOUND from MGS1 with the emotions of the Cobra Unit of MGS3 to create ""Laughing Octopus"", ""Raging Raven"", ""Crying Wolf"", and ""Screaming Mantis"". Out of all of these bosses, only Laughing Octopus is really enjoyable to fight, as she uses a lot of stealth and surprise tactics. The others are just gimmicky fights that tend to be more annoying than fun. The worst part is that these bosses have nothing to do with the storyline other than ""they're an elite unit under the bad guy's control"".The graphics in the game are smooth and effective. The animation, in particular, seems very natural and realistic, with a lot more focus on how people actually move. There's no fault that can be found with the graphics; the characters and environments seem exactly as good and detailed as they need to be, and definitely help keep you immersed. The voice acting is great, with a lot of nostalgic returns from the original Metal Gear Solid's voice crew for characters that are returning in this new game. The music is usually understated, allowing the environmental noises - gunfire, yells, wind, and so on - to take center stage except in situations when Snake has been spotted, when tense and exciting music plays. The quality of the music is excellent, being thematic and evocative for each different area of the game. One of the items is an iPod that allows Snake to play songs that he has collected in the game. Some of these songs actually affect gameplay; certain battle themes will increase Snake's accuracy or health regeneration, while other songs will cause emotions in enemies that Snake has caught in a chokehold (presumably, that's where they have to be so that they are close enough to hear the music).Overall, MGS4 is an incredible game, but there's not enough ""game"" to rate it that highly as a total package. The overwhelming presence of cutscenes was incredibly stifling, and the sections of the game that were working with the established rules of the game were remarkably short. It feels like the game got too caught up in the story and forgot it was supposed to be a game, deciding instead to spend almost all of its time expounding on philosophy and history from previous Metal Gear games. There were a lot of really good sections, but these were far too short and seemed more like exceptions to the norm. If it was being rated as a movie, it would deserve full marks, but to rate it as a game, it only deserves an 7 or 8 out of 10 at most.UPDATE: The full walkthrough for both the regular and online components of this game are now done. We give the online component a 9/10 rating.""",4,Prepare for Really Long Cutscenes,2008/6/16 0:00

After what has seemed like an eternity of waiting, Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is here, and not only is it a stunning achievement in terms of technical aspects (this game utilizes what the PS3 is capable of like nothing you have ever seen before), but it also conveys one of the deepest and most engrossing storylines that you will ever come across in a video game.  Yes, as you have no doubt heard by now, the game features some quite lengthy cut-scenes that seemingly pop up out of nowhere in the middle of gameplay.  While this can get annoying, nearly everything else about Metal Gear Solid 4 is simply flawless.  The storyline, what little can be mentioned without giving away a barrage of spoilers, finds an aging Snake in the middle of Liquid Ocelot's new, destructive plans.  Familiar faces are abound as well, which will lead to many surprises and shocks, even for the most hardcore of Metal Gear Solid fans.  As said before, Metal Gear Solid 4 boasts the best audio and visual presentation you will ever see in a video game.  Quite frankly, this game is a gorgeous sight to behold.  Gameplay wise, the game offers up some equally impressive shooting and stealth mechanics, while the boss fights are nothing short of epic.  Online multiplayer modes seem to be the only aspect of MGS4 that don't conjure up the awe-inspiring moments that the rest of the game does, but they are fun on their own regardless.  Words alone can't do this game justice though.  Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is by far and large the best game to come out on the PS3 thus far, and without a doubt is one of the finest video games to ever see the light of day.  Yes, it really is that good, and if you have been waiting for that PS3 killer app"", your wait is over.""",5,Pure brilliance,2008/6/15 0:00
A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B000FQ2D5E,"Richard Baker BinaryMessiah""""",0,0,"The Good: Amazing audio/visual experience, well crafted story, plenty of weapons, fully fledged multiplayer, tons of elements to keep you busyThe Bad: Disappointing bosses, not many people are playing online, cut scenes are dragged out way too long, why all the installing?Metal Gear Solid is one of the most memorable game series ever created and MGS4 is a great topping on the cake. Not only does MGS4 offer an incredibly riveting story, but also some great multiplayer as well as hidden stuff for long time MGS fans irking all the way back to the original game.Starting out with MGS4 is kind of daunting due to the deep storyline that is hard to follow unless you have played the other three games, but you can manage if you are smart enough and stick with the story. The only problem I had with the story are the drawn out cut scenes that can last over 30 minutes thanks to Hideo Kojima's love for cinematic storytelling. Most of the length comes at the end of every chapter, the mission briefing, then the beginning of the next chapter. Each chapter took over 30 minutes to start, and sometimes the dialog can drag on and become sleep inducing.Metal Gear has always been known for its stealth game play and MGS4 is the first Metal Gear game to give you complete control of the camera and even implementing a first person mode. The greatest improvement (for me) was the fact that sneaking through compounds, camps, and war frontlines didn't feel like a puzzle anymore, but like a stealth game. The amount of stuff in your HUD may be overwhelming at first, but you will adjust. You have a health meter, psyche meter (that I never found any reason to keep track of), item and weapon menu, camouflage gauge, and a radar screen. You can also buy weapons and ammo from Drebin's Shop using Drebin points that are accumulated by picking up weapons on the battlefield. You can also customize weapons now with silencers, grenade launchers, shotguns, flashlights and more. There are dozens of weapons to buy and each come in handy for certain situations.Using your camouflage is one of my favorite elements because whenever you lie still your suit copies the texture on the ground and lets your blend in better. Throughout the game you will acquire more types of camouflage, but the suit is great. You can even change the color of your vest and face. Another element that I love is the change of pace in the game. No longer are you confined to stealth only elements since there will be full-out fire fights through some levels, vehicle sections, and even a section where you use a mech. That doesn't sound like Metal Gear to you? Welcome to evolution.The game just feels fluid, smooth, and transitions well and has a perfect play time of about 15-20 hours. You can also partly interact with the cinematic by zooming in, and at key points pressing L1 for a first person view and pressing X or flashbacks of previous games. I do have to say my biggest disappointment were the boss fights since they aren't as original as in previous games. Most just have you shooting enemies to death and using a key element to figure out how to actually kill them.There are a multitude of CQC moves for you to use against enemies or just a good silenced shot to the head works too. Hiding bodies isn't such a big deal anymore since you are in a war and crawling through dead bodies will be like tomorrow's chores after a while. Using camouflage to blend is just probably the key element to the sneaking in this game since using shadows and lying still is key.When it comes to multiplayer you are in for a treat because Metal Gear Online is a fully integrated online system that is separate from the game. You have several different game types (all the ones you can expect) all while using Drebin points to use guns during matches, and using your experience points to level up and buy stuff for your character through the Konami website. There are several expansions available, but Metal Gear just never felt like an online thing for me. It is fun, but trying to find a room with 16 people is kind of rare especially at lower levels. The online element of Metal Gear is strangely deep for a game that doesn't get much online traffic since Metal Gear feel strictly like a single player only experience, but it's there for people who want it.If Metal Gear turned you off before you should give it another shot because it truly mixes stealth and action beautifully and even someone who doesn't care too much for Metal Gear (me) can love this game. The game looks amazing and all the characters look life-like and are rendered beautifully. The voice acting is top-notch, and nothing can type the fight scenes. Patience is a virtue with this game, but you get a great feeling of satisfaction after sneaking through a whole enemy camp unseen. It is easier than previous games, but also still offers a challenge.If you love the Metal Gear saga then you should have this already, but even people who never played a Metal Gear game and get engrossed in this wonderfully crafted and touching story while being sucked into the single player experience.",5,"A wonderful game, and this is coming from someone who didn't care for Metal Gear",2012/3/28 0:00

Rhodes,64,52,"Pros:+Very satisfying story+Incredible voice work+Incredible cinematics+Eagle eye attention to detail+A lot of gameplay elements+Memorable Music SoundtrackCons:-Long cutscenes.  To the point where you feel more like you're watching than playing.  This goes a long way as you'll play for five seconds to be treated to cutscenes several minutes long-Some load times are really annoying-The Camera can sometimes be a painAfter three and a half long years of waiting, Metal Gear Solid 4 finally drops down on the Playstation 3.  With a lot of questions to answer and some mighty big shoes to fill, Metal Gear Solid 4 is easily one of the most anticipated video games ever made.  For the Metal Gear fan, the game is absolutely fantastic.  Continuing an already mesmerizing story, Metal Gear Solid 4 proves to be one of this generations greatest games.Metal Gear Solid 4 is the conclusion to Snake's story.  The game is told through some gorgeous cutscenes.  There's a lot of detail to the characters faces, their actions and it has some fantastic voice acting to boot.  You'll want to grab some popcorn, though, because there are definitely a lot of cutscenes in Metal Gear Solid 4, and some of them are really long.  This is easily the biggest problem with Metal Gear Solid 4 and it's one that has often plagued the series.  While the cutscenes are very dramatic and well written, and while they even shed some humor, some of them are just too long, some of them seeming almost useless.  If a cutscene is getting a little long, though, it would be a grave mistake to skip it as you might miss some important parts of the story.  And if there's any Metal Gear Solid game one should be playing for its story, it's this one.  The other big problem with the cutscenes is how they come at you, even early on.  There are moments where you'll play for a matter of seconds only to be sit through a cutscene that's several minutes long.  At the very least, you can pause the game during the cutscenes.  However, it's hard to get over the fact that some of them really drag on.  When you get to play the game, though, Metal Gear Solid 4 is amazing.Metal Gear Solid has always been about stealth.  The same is true of Guns of the Patriots.  The difference being that you're also in the middle of a war and there are two sides fighting against one another, the PMCs and Militia.  You're able to help the militia and doing so can have its rewards, such as characters being willing to give you items or being able to go through certain areas more easily. Although, you can also turn the Militia against you.There have been some improvements to sneaking around, though.  The camouflage system has returned but it's much better.  Rather than having to go into the menu constantly, Snake's camo will change automatically to blend in with the environment and help him evade enemies.  You can also hold up enemies just like before, only this time you can perform body searches while holding them up rather than having to shake them down.  You can also restrain them to the ground to knock them out.  If you really need to get by an enemy and you're running out of options, you can always play dead.  This also works when you get spotted and knocked down by an enemy.There's also the implementation of the Solid Eye.  This is more vital to sneaking around than anything.  It works very similar to the radar in Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops, showing you how much noise you or your enemy is making.  Also new to here is the threat ring.  The threat ring surrounds Snake at all times and will begin to act up depending on how close an enemy is to him.  All of these seem like they'll take forever to get used to, but you'll quickly adapt.  Just like previous games in the series, if you're spotted, you'll have to escape from the enemy and hide.There are also moments where you can take control of a Metal Gear Mk II, a very small version of Metal Gear that is controlled by Snake.  This little guy allows Snake to scout out the area ahead.  You can also use the Metal Gear Mk II to stun certain enemies.Lastly, Snake has a psyche gauge.  This is very similar to the stamina gauge in Metal Gear Solid 3.  The gauge depletes depending on how stressed or exhausted Snake is.  You can refill this by eating certain snacks like Rations or Noodles, but you can also refill it by resting for a while.  But there are plenty of factors that affect Psyche.  For example, if Snake has been in the sun too long, you'll have to move him into the shade.  If he's been in cold water, you'll have to get him out of it.  As his psyche gauge gets lower it becomes harder for him to perform certain actions, such as being able to aim properly.  In other words, from time to time Snake will need to rest.  Though there are also certain points in the game where his psyche gauge is restocked automatically.You won't always be in stealth mode forever, though.  There will be times when you have to fight, and the shooting mechanic works much better in Metal Gear Solid 4.  When you're thrust into combat, the game plays very similar to a third person shooter.  Allowing for more precise aiming and no longer forcing you to go into first person view to land a well placed shot.  There's also a weapon shop where you can purchase, upgrade or customize weapons to your liking, another element that works to your liking and gives Metal Gear a lot of customization.All this variation in gameplay means that Metal Gear Solid 4 has several different ways to approach it.  Combine it's various gameplay elements with a selection of difficulty levels to up the challenge, and Metal Gear Solid 4, like the three before it, becomes a game you'll want to replay again and again.  Sometimes it's just fun to mess around with your enemies or just to see how else you can go about a certain area.Visually, Metal Gear Solid 4 is incredible to look at.  There's a ton of detail in the environment, and the atmosphere is also a good one.  You're very much immersed in the world of Metal Gear Solid 4.  There are a couple of load times that can be annoying, especially the installation.  The camera, while it's great, can sometimes be a pain.  It's easy to control, but sometimes you'll find yourself fighting with it.Music wise, there's a memorable score to Metal Gear Solid 4.  There's a lot of voice work as well.  Much of it is great, although at times you will get the feeling that some of the voice actors and over-acting.  On the whole, Metal Gear Solid 4 is a beautiful looking, (and sounding) game.Metal Gear Solid 4 is an amazing experience.  If you can handle lengthy cutscenes you'll be satisfied with the final results.  If you can handle a couple of annoying load times, you'll be satisfied.  The amount of gameplay here is incredible, and the fact that there are so many ways to go about each area is also a lot of fun.  For Metal Gear fans, Metal Gear Solid 4 is easily the reason to own a Playstation 3.",5,"War Has Changed...""""",2008/6/12 0:00
A2582KMXLK2P06,B000FQ9QVI,B. E Jackson,5,2,"I haven't played a new Mario game since Super Mario 64, and my experience with that game left me feeling like it was an unexceptional and overrated game, with the biggest complaint being there were simply WAY too many empty areas throughout the game resulting in too much pointless roaming around to do.  Lack of enemies severely hurt Super Mario 64.Well, more than 12 years later, I'm now playing Super Mario Galaxy that I received for Christmas... and uh oh.  The same exact problems I experienced with Super Mario 64 have returned, and in most likelihood, those problems probably never even left in the first place (so I'm definitely not kicking myself for ignoring every new Mario release over the last several years).  It appears like I didn't miss anything special about the Mario series at all the last 10 years.  Unless utter disappointment and frustration qualifies as special?  Didn't think so.The number one biggest complaint with Super Mario Galaxy is that it's VERY hard to control Mario's movements.  You think I'm terrible at video games?  Guess again- I've been playing video games for over 20 years and learned to deal with a variety of different movements, many of which were *really* downright confusing and discouraging (such as a fair share from the NES console for example) but nothing has EVER given me as much frustration as this game has.First of all, Mario doesn't move with *nearly* as much speed as he did in the older Mario games, and in fact, there's not even a run button.  Why is this?  I have no earthly idea.  When you take away the speed, you inadvertently take away the crucial element of fun"".  Simple as that.Furthermore, a lot of times the camera pans out so you can barely even SEE where Mario is going, or what Mario is even doing!  This results in a *lot* of unfair, cheap and untimely deaths.  It's ridiculous that I keep falling over the edge (and into that huge orange/black spinning black hole of instant death that constantly lurks below) simply because I can't see what Mario is doing.Oh, and no- it's NOT my television screen either.  It's perfectly fine.  My eyes are fine too.  The fact that Mario's movements are so slow and stiff also contributes to many unnecessary deaths.  This is NOT why I fell in love with the Mario series back when I had an NES and Super NES either.  Had Super Galaxy been my first exposure to the series, I would have thrown the game in the trash after giving it 5 solid hours of my precious time.I wish the movements were as precise and fluid as the ones found in the Spyro the Dragon series, specifically the *original* Spyro the Dragon series that appeared on the Playstation One console.  That particular series did 3D movements perfectly, not to mention it was a heck of a lot more fun running around collecting gems, completing mini games, interacting with many unique characters, and checking out more interesting/creative environments than the ones included here.Certain objectives later on in Super Mario Galaxy require *exact* movements in order to complete, and if you're off just a tad, you will fall to your death over and *over* again.  It's quite annoying, and to be completely honest -despite what people think- even the hardest of the old-school 2D Mario games such as Lost Levels and Yoshi's Island were significantly less frustrating than this.  At least I knew what I did wrong when I died in the older games, and learned from it next time.  There's no learning here- you either land safely or you don't.  Not much in the way of a learning curve.Oh, and those levels where you're positioned on top of a huge clear rolling ball and forced to use the Wii remote to steer it around correctly are, in my opinion, the biggest annoyance I've EVER had to deal with in a video game.Overall, do NOT buy this game for your kids-  Super Mario Galaxy was designed in a way that requires gaming skills of near perfection.  If you don't have the patience to perfect your skills, surprise surprise- this game will have you throwing your Wii remote/Nunchuk at the TV screen countless times.  That's a promise.""",2,"Mario in 3D- oh boy, it never gets better",2009/12/26 0:00
A36UKFV79879MD,B000FQ9QVI,BX Lounger,0,0,"Mario's last game, Super Mario Sunshine (Gamecube), left a mixed bag of reactions and criticisms. For those who played it either loved it or hated it and since then most of them waited for his next big adventure. Nintendo was under intense pressure to deliver something epic for their brand new Wii console and Super Mario Galaxy was released in 2007. Did they deliver? Absolutely!While there is not much of a story behind this game (or any Mario game but that's to be expected), this time around Mario goes from one galaxy to the next one, beating up (classic & new) enemies and using power ups, all to collect stars he will need to reach Bowser. There are many galaxies to explore and they can all be reached via a floating space hub. Collecting stars unlocks parts of the space hub that leads to more galaxies. Get 60 stars and you face Bowser. If you get all 120 stars, you will unlock Luigi as a playable character. Play as Luigi and get all 120 stars and you'll get access to a secret galaxy.The PROS: Just like Metroid Prime 3 Corruption showed what the Wii can do, Super Mario Galaxy doesthe same thing and it shows. This game is beautiful! The presentation is top notch, the controls are spot on (motion gestures are kept to a minimum), the music sets the mood perfectly and the sounds are exactly what you expect to hear in the game. The new power ups are cool and so are the themes for the galaxies you get to explore. There is an incentive to get all 120 stars since you'll be rewarded for all the hard work. Speaking of hard work, SMG is challenging but not overwhelming so it will take you some time before you truly beat the game. This time, there is limited 2 player co op support (though the second player takes control of a little star who can help shoot and collect Star Bits; that's about it.)The CONS: It seems that with every major Mario title, the camera is really the only issue in the game. It's a lot better since the days of Super Mario 64 but it's only slightly better than the camera in Super Mario Sunshine. One day we will get a Mario game where the camera works flawlessly.Do not read what the 1 and 2 star rating reviews say. There are many people who play the Wii but aren't used to the demands of certain games where you do more than just point and shoot so they go ahead and give this game a bad rating. If you've been playing games for a long time and are into more than first person shooting games, then you will see why this game earned glowing reviews and praise. Super Mario Galaxy sold very well and with the recent announcement that certain older Wii titles (including this one) will be sold at $19.99 each, now is a perfect time to play it for yourself if you hadn't done so already.

A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000FQ9QVI,"Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...""",9,8,"A game intended to continue the line set by Super Mario 64 and later Super Mario Sunshine, Super Mario Galaxy is the latest in Nintendo's star franchise. Exploring the depths of space, Super Mario Galaxy braves a new frontier and also returns to many familiar settings.As per usual, the game centers around rescuing Princess Peach from the grip of Bowser, who uses a spaceship to steal Peach's entire castle. Mario, attempting to defend her, is flung into space, where he encounters the Luma, friendly star-shaped creatures. The Luma take him to their mama"", Rosalina, who operates a space station / observatory. Bowser has stolen the Grand Stars that power the station, and they must be retrieved to chase after him.The space station is the central hub of the game. The player arrives after receiving a Grand Star, which is used to power the first doorway. This doorway leads to several different ""galaxies"" - collections of floating planetoids - with more being accessible the more stars are collected. Each collection of galaxies ends in one of Bowser's bases, where a full-strength Grand Star is hidden. Much like Mario 64 and Sunshine, each galaxy represents a stage, and there are different objectives to go after (with a selection screen to determine which one you want to go after). The galaxies themselves consist of small planetoids with their own gravity; this can be disorienting at first, as you are essentially running across a sphere that is holding you down, instead of across a flat plain. You can jump up and you'll just fall back inwards to the planet, though the camera is usually above the planetoid and not right behind you (which is also a bit confusing). You must jump from planet to planet using the Luma's star launchers, which are usually unlocked through some deed on the various planetoids. There are a wide variety of galaxies, ranging from the ""main"" galaxies - with story events and multiple stars - to the ""bonus"" galaxies that tend to only have one star but are given in a minigame or similar test (for example, the Manta Ray surfing games that use the Wii remote to steer and boost).The gameplay itself, apart from the planetoids, is similar to earlier 3d Mario games. Mario jumps and hops the same as other games, though his melee attacks are replaced by a spinning attack. Mario can still fall into ""pits"", though due to the gravity this usually means the planetoid's exposed core or a black hole. Another big difference is that the player also uses the Wii remote's cursor to collect Star Bits - little colored pieces of stars that can be used to shoot enemies or feed the Lumas. Many parts require a certain amount of star bits to feed a hungry Luma so that he transforms into a new planetoid or even a galaxy. Furthermore, collecting 50 star bits gets you a level up (this is also true for coins, which normally restore health). Mario has some new powerups, too; in addition to old standards like fireballs and flight, Mario now also has a Bee Mushroom (which allows him to fly and climb on certain walls), a Spring Mushroom (which gives him more jumping power in exchange for some reductions to other abilities), and a Boo Mushroom (which turns him into a Boo, the series' famous ghosts, and pass through walls). Finally, a co-op mode is available where one player takes the role of the cursor, collecting star bits and shooting them at enemies, as well as several other boosts that can be given to the first player that make the game easier (for example, stunning enemies and giving Mario a jump boost).The graphics are the bright, colorful, rounded graphics familiar to Mario fans, though they are smoother and brighter with the Wii's technology. The levels are varied, but tend to be fairly bright and cheery. The music is similarly cheerful, with a HUGE amount of callbacks to old games, with recognizable songs from the original Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Brothers 3, and Super Mario World. Sound effects are often of a musical nature, providing a sort of active symphony as you fight bosses or enemies.As a whole, this game seems much more like a return to the classic days of Mario gaming. With an abundance of references to old games and a lot of new elements as well, Super Mario Galaxy is well suited to continuing the tradition that the Mario games have upheld.10/10.""",5,Classic References and New Elements,2008/2/15 0:00
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000FQ9QVI,"Michael Kerner Michael Kerner""""",426,394,"When it comes to anticapated games for the Nintendo Wii, many of them have wanted one thing, Mario. It has been nearly a year though since the Wii was launched with The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess as the main attraction, but many die hard fans have been anxious for a game that has delivered the appeal of Super Mario 64 from Mario's hay day. Although Super Mario Sunshine was also a fun game for the Nintendo Gamecube, it just didn't deliver as well as the Nintendo 64 classic had proven. But, Mario has proven his strength earlier this year on the Wii with gems like Super Paper Mario & Mario Party 8 which both worked well as great buys for the Nintendo system, but this is the one that reaches to the stratosphere.Super Mario Galaxy for the Nintendo Wii, brings in the big guns, as Mario does whatever it takes to save Princess Toadstool a.k.a. Peach from the clutches of Bowser. This time around, Mario takes to the sky to help him in his quest. Along the way, Mario has to collect star bits, which can help him beat enemies and bosses of all kinds, from the classics like Thwomps and goombas, to bigger than life boss battles like a vulgar spider who shoots venom at you, and even a mecha robot that fires bullet bills at you from all different angles.There are also a few new features here that Mario shines through as well in the game, like specialty suits like the bee suit, which transforms Mario into a bumble bee, that can make mario fly through the Honeycomb stage, where he can collect coins and stars from each of the levels. There is also the boo suit, where Mario can actually become the ghostly menace, Boo in the haunted house level to help him enter ghostly portals that Mario couldn't normally enter, but it also can make the other Boo ghosts quickly fall in love with Mario in the blink of an eye. There are also some returns of classic items to use as well like the Fire Flower, and a new ice flower that Mario could use to freeze his foes on ice.The graphics in the game are absolutely breathtaking and appeal well to the Wii's eyes, while the music is simplistic and elequent to the ears of Mario fans, especially as he surfs the galaxy. The control is also very simple to manuver, and stays mainly relevant to the palms of the Wii remote and nunchucks' hands. You can also use the Wii remote to help you grapple onto trees and meteors that can help you launch from one platform to another, and you can also use to help you collect star bits, and perform new attacks like the spin move. There is also a new co-op mode where for the first time, two people can play, as you can use another player to help you collect star bits, to help you along your quest, and defeat tougher foes like a giant octopus in the lava, and even giant goombas that are beyond the heights of the world.All in all, what I love about Super Mario Galaxy is that it is everything Wii owners have wanted in a great game, and more. It is a definite must buy for the Wii that is sure to bring a lot of excitement into die hard Mario fans. This is one game that really brings out the heart at being the best of what the Nintendo Wii has delivered, and that has still shown to die hard Mario fans of all ages. I absolutely recommend it as a great buy on a star-spectacular scale.Graphics: ASound: A+Control: A-Fun & Enjoyment: AOverall: A",5,Mario In The Sky,2007/11/11 0:00
AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000FQ9QVI,"N. Durham Big Evil""""",91,79,"The classic Super Mario 64 re-defined the platformer for a new generation of gamers.  The long anticipated Super Mario Galaxy, what I consider to be the true sequel to Super Mario 64 (sorry Super Mario Sunshine!) re-defines the modern day platformer once again, and is a crowning achievement for the license, Nintendo, the Wii, and video games in general.  Princess Peach is in dire straits once again in Bowser's clutches, and Mario embarks on an interstellar quest to save her.  The first thing you'll no doubt notice are the game's incredibly stellar graphics.  The Wii is far from a technical powerhouse, but Super Mario Galaxy is by far the absolute best looking game to hit the Wii yet.  The game's new take on gravity, physics, and puzzles combine to make for some of the most excellent level designs you'll ever come across in your mission to save Peach and collect stars, and the flawless Wii-mote controls only make the gameplay experience even better.  There are a bunch of new Mario suits to enhance your abilities (some are easier to get a hang of than others), and the platforming elements, even though they've been taken to new levels here, are a Mario fan's dream come true.  If there's any downsides to Super Mario Galaxy, it's that the gravity and physics of the environments may cause some nautiousness for some, and the semi-co-op mode could have been done better, but the overall game is so good that these are extremely minor negatives.  All in all, Super Mario Galaxy is undoubtedly the best game to hit the Wii yet, and needless to say is an essential addition to your Wii library.  For those that don't own a Wii, give Super Mario Galaxy a try, you'll be quite happy you did.",5,A crowning achievement,2007/11/13 0:00

If you look as it in basic terms the game is just like the Mario brothers game except that instead of playing on one world and passing levels you travel through the galaxy onto different worlds that obviously represent levels to rescue the princess yet again and help restore the cosmos back to the way it's suppose to be.  You will also have some of the regular baddies in the game as well as a few new ones as well also a few unique bosses to beat on certain planets to advance through the game as well.  The effects and animation are great for the Mario gaming world as well a some of the new ways Mario can use to jump stomp or spin past his enemies to reach the end.  The one thing though is if you're not a fan of the Mario games you might not have as much fun playing the game though as this game was definitely meant for Mario fans,  though I think most people will still find some entertainment in playing the game.

It just didn't have enough...Wiiness if that makes any sense. While there are wonderful ideas and elements in the game SMG is nothing original. The game has you flying across planetoids and what not to save Princess Peach from Bowser once again. With the addition of collecting star bits by using the cursor of the Wiimote and using them to stun enemies and feed Lumas, this is just one of many elements that makes SMG great.You can flick the Wiimote to make Mario spin, and the controls are very well thought out. It's not really the controls or anything that makes SMG unique but its the style of the game. For example there is a galaxy where you'll have fruit planetoids and you need to smash wood plugs to make a worm come out of the apple planetoids to cross to the next. With this coupled with bright colorful (and actually somewhat next-gen) graphics it's total eye candy (for the Wii anyways). The game also sports charming and wonderful music. What also makes the game unique is how you explore the levels. The game uses gravity tricks a lot such as switching gravity on you at certain points, using gravity spotlights, being able to walk around a planetoid instead of falling off etc. You can also change into Bee Mario, which lets you fly and cling to walls, there's Fire Mario, Rainbow Mario, Ice Mario etc.All these things are just so cleverly crafted together and it gives you that warm fuzzy feeling inside. There's no way to express how cool this all is unless you just play the game. While this is good and all it does have its flaws. There are occasional frustrating platforming segments that have too much action going on, or things move to fast for you to figure out what to do. While the game does sport a co-op mode it's nothing really special or interesting. The story is the same as every other Mario game and has a confusing and disappointing ending etc.The only people who don't see this are the Nintendo fan boys and die-hard Mario fans.

A2TCG2HV1VJP6V,B000FQ9QVI,Ryan Sil. (Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...,0,0,"You've probably seen how revolutionary Super Mario 64 was on the Nintendo 64. Well, imagine if the game was separated into mini planets, and you see Mario soaring through the air as he was launched into the air. That, my friends, is Mario Galaxy.The game starts out with Mario roaming through a gorgeously detailed Mushroom Kingdom as he runs to Peach's Castle...for cake. But then, guess what? Not only does Bowser kidnap Peach again. He kidnaps Peach in a very epic cutscene! Unfortunately for Mario, a Magikoopa sends him flying into the galaxy, knocking him out.Now, the main game is playing through very big and graphical 3D worlds bouncing on Goombas, collecting coins, and all kinds of other stuff. But, like Super Mario 64, you must collect Stars. Collect enough Stars to be able to play in another world, or maybe have Mario tussle with Bowser. If you were to play the game, you'll notice that everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, is much, much deeper and more fun than I am describing it.The music is nothing like I've ever heard in a Mario game. I mean, seriously. Once I played the game until after I beat the first Bowser boss, I was thinking Oh, my god. These tracks are from a MARIO game??"". The music also breathes air into the spacey atmosphere in the game.The one major complaint I have with this game is that the 2-Player mode is stupid. There's almost nothing the second player can do to help the first player play through the game. Sure, he/she can collect Star Bits, launch them at enemies, and fling those...rubber..trees at enemies. But that's pretty much it. The second player doesn't even have his/her own character (Thanks, Mario Galaxy 2).But other than the 2-Player mode, the game is amazing. It is one of the best Wii games you can buy.Oh, and Spoiler Alert: Luigi is playable after you collect all 121 Stars, in case you didn't know.""",5,A main Mario game on Wii?

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000FQ9QVI,S. Rhodes,11,9,"Mario is a huge staple in gaming.  When a Mario game comes out it can't just be good"" it has to be ""great.""  In the past, Mario games have defined the platformers of their generation.  From Super Mario Bros. over 20 years ago, to Super Mario 64 bringing platforming into 3D in a whole new light.  Super Mario Sunshine, however, did not turn nearly as many heads as Super Mario 64.  Understandable, seeing as how Super Mario 64 is a tough game to compare to.  Super Mario Galaxy does compare, though.  While it doesn't reinvent the wheel, it serves as an example of why Mario continues to rule the platforming genre.Mario has never been a game to pick up for its storyline.  As usual, things are peaceful in the Mushroom Kingdom.  In this case, they're enjoying the star festival.  As usual, Bowser comes in and decides to stir up trouble.  He ends up kidnapping Princess Peach and once again its up to Mario to go rescue her.  In order to reach Bowser's hideout, though, he'll have to collect power stars to do so.  It borrows a lot from Super Mario 64 in the plot development, but this is hardly the same game.  Like all Mario games, the story is simplistic.  We've been saving Peach for over 20 years and it won't be stopping soon.  You do not pick up Super Mario Galaxy for its storyline.  It's all about the gameplay.Like every Mario game, Galaxy is easy to pick up and learn but incredibly difficult to master.  Through your travels you'll control Mario as you tackle the bad guys of the Galaxy.  Mario's basic movies are all here.  He can jump, triple jump and spin.  It's very similar to Super Mario 64.  The obstacles in Mario's way however range from Bowser's troopers to natural disasters like black holes.  Getting every single star can be a tough task.  Like the other Mario games in the past, though, it isn't necessary to get every single star in order to fight the end boss.There are also suits for Mario can wear in his travels.  There is the usual flower power and invincible star, but you'll also find new suits.  There's the bee suit, which lets Mario fly.  He can turn into a Boo and go through walls.  He can even become a spring.  Needless to say, there's a lot of variety in this gameplay.There are several Wii games where the motion sensor controls have either been overused or they feel downright tacked on as an afterthought.  In Super Mario Galaxy that's not the case.  The motion sensor controls are not overused, nor are they forgotten about.  From time to time you may find yourself rolling a ball around using the Wii remote like a joystick.  Or you might be surfing on a manta ray.  You'll shake the remote to execute Mario's spin move, and there's also a star you can control to pick up star bits and fire them off at enemies.There's also a multiplayer aspect to Super Mario Galaxy, but it's certainly not all that engaging.  Player 2 can use a separate remote to control a star and collect star bits and shoot them at enemies.  Player 2 can also hold enemies still for Mario and make him jump.  That's really all there is.  Nothing more.  It's interesting at first, but it's hard to shake the fact that player 2 just doesn't do a lot of anything.Visually, Super Mario Galaxy is a pretty good looking game.  By far the best the Wii has to offer.  The detail is just incredible and the environments are gorgeous looking.  There's also a great deal of attention done with the physics.  It's fun to just jump up and watch Mario get pulled into the gravitational pull of another object.  It's pretty cool stuff.  If there was anything wrong with Super Mario Galaxy's presentation it would be that the player doesn't have complete control over the camera.  The camera work isn't bad but from time to time there will be an object in your way.  Luckily, this doesn't happen often enough to be a problem.The game also sounds brilliant.  Easily some of the best music the series has ever had.  You'll hear remixed tunes from previous Mario adventures as well as whole lot of new stuff.  It's perfectly orchestrated.  There isn't a whole lot of voice acting in Super Mario Galaxy aside from Mario's shouts and screams and Bowser grunting.  This probably won't bother most players as there isn't much story in the game anyway.Super Mario Galaxy is a great game.  It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it has fantastic gameplay that is unmatched and unparalleled.  If you're a Wii owner, this is the game to get.Pros:+Strong and varied gameplay+Gorgeous looking environments+There's co-op play for those who want it+The game sounds really good+Tight intuitive controlsCons:-The multiplayer is not very involving-The player doesn't have control over the camera, which can be a burden in some spots""",5,Out of This World,2007/11/14 0:00

They are just bitter people who do not know how to review a game and/or never liked the Smash Bros games to begin with. If you want the real deal on whether to get this game or not, continue to read below****Super Smash Bros Brawl continues the Smash Bros series that started on the Nintendo 64. For those who know about the series, it needs no introduction. For everyone else, it's a fighting game where you choose from several infamous Nintendo characters to fight against others in a match. During the match, you can pick up various weapons, items and power ups that appear for anyone to use. The last player left standing is the winner of the match. This game features various modes to play through with loads of unlockables waiting to be discovered; unlockables range from secret characters, secret stages, trophies, music tracks and game demos. So you can play through the main story mode, practice moves in the training mode, battle it out with friends in the multi player mode, sample demos of classic Nintendo games or connect online to battle other players from around the world. Your stats and everything you unlock are saved automatically every time you play. This game supports multiple controller setups: the Wii Remote by itself, Nunchuk and Wii Remote, Classic Controller (or Pro version) and the Gamecube controller.The PROS: This game is fun, fun and fun! Including the secret characters, you have access to over 30 characters and dozens upon dozens of stages to fight on. The graphics are gorgeous and shows exactly that the Wii can handle games with great graphics. The same goes for the sound effects, music, voice acting and overall presentation. With multiple controller support, you can easily find which controller suits your tastes and the controls are easy to remember and help you get into the game. There are lots of stuff to unlock so after you beat the main story mode, this game will keep you busy for a very long time. Challenge your friends in the multi player modes and connect online to play against other players, even keeping rosters of people you want to play with so you can meet up with them later.The CONS: While this game is great, there are a few issues that I wish it didn't have. First, this game is on a dual layer disc. It means the Wii reads data from both sides of the game disc and there have been reports that peoples' systems have stopped reading game discs or repeatedly crashed while owners played this game. The lens in the Wii optical drive can't handle reading data from a dual layer game disc so Nintendo did offer to fix the Wii systems for free. Second, while having a lot of characters is good, some of them have very similar moves even though they look different. This was a problem before in Super Smash Bros Melee that made its way into Brawl and decreases the variety between the fighters. Lastly, the online multi player works when it wants to. Super Smash Bros Brawl was one of the first games to try out Nintendo's Wi-Fi connection and this was a big request made by the fans: to play it online. When it works, you don't wait long to connect with other players and the matches don't lag or slow down. When it didn't work, it took forever to find other players to start the matches. If someone had a slow connection, every player felt it. Sometimes, you lose the connection and have to go back and connect with other players. If you don't go to internet forums and exchange friend codes with other players, you won't be able to request people to be on your list before or after matches. You can play against random people but they won't be added to your friend roster unless you have their friend codes.While it has flaws, Super Smash Bros Brawl is a good fun that non gamers and gamers alike can play, has lots of modes to check out and allows you to play with or against other players online. With the announcement of the next Wii console already making waves across the internet and setting off massive rumors, it won't be long before the next Smash Bros game will be released to the gaming public. This is a game worth owning and the price has already dropped so it's affordable. I recommend this game to Nintendo fans and gamers in general.",4,HONEST and TRUTHFUL review,2011/5/9 0:00
A2LPJD19MGBNXJ,B000FQ9R4E,"Adrian Jenkins southerndudeman""""",78,49,"Let me preface this by saying that I like Smash Brothers."" I don't love it, but the multiplayer goodness makes this one better than it otherwise would have been.The Good:1) I love the graphics in this. I mean, they are solid stuff. The attention is evident in every phase of the game, from the delightfully detailed main characters to the excellent backdrops. This is a joy to behold.2) The mechanics you know and love are back, which makes for some excellent multiplayer madness. It remains very easy to pull off big moves, and with the handicapping, you can get balanced gaming every time. I really like the ""final smashes"" - while not necessary, it is incredibly satisfying to pummel your cohorts by throwing them in a giant pot and cooking them.3) I really enjoyed the timeline and masterpiece sections. Of course, giving people trials of all the old NES and SNES games is just cheap advertising, but that's fine with me. I can't wait to get ""Super Metroid"" from the Wii shop channel.4) Trophy collecting is back, and I love it. Moreover, you can now collect stickers as well. Finally, you collect either of them by blasting them in a silly asteroids-like shooter. Good stuff.The bad:1) Subspace emissary stinks. I had high hopes for this after hearing the hype, but it is vastly inferior to the adventure mode in ""Melee"". Why, you ask? Because it's just as pointless, but now takes an incredibly long time. Very unenjoyable, IMHO.2) Control. The Wii has one of the most innovative controllers out there, and a game of this magnitude should utilize it to the fullest, right? Right?!? Wrong. In fact, this game is actually easier to play with the old GC controllers than the Wii nunchuk. I'm stunned that the developers didn't make an effort to incorporate the Wii goodness into the game. Well, stunned and disappointed. What a letdown.3) What is all this ""friend code"" stuff? Do people really like this? Not me (although i do think that the Wifi has been underrated in these reviews - I like it a lot).4) I agree with an early reviewer that there is something very fishy about Nintendo's insistence that the game read errors are the product of a ""soiled lens"". In any case, lenses get soiled. It shouldn't cause fatal errors in reading software. Thumbs down to Nintendo, who usually builds the most reliable product out there.In short, this is not the game it could have been, which is a surprise, considering the number of delays in its production. I think it is an unfair criticism for the game that it hasn't changed the formula in all these years - if I wanted ""Final Fantasy,"" I wouldn't buy ""Smash"". However, it is perfectly legitimate to ask why the gameplay hasn't improved since the original ""Smash Brothers"" for the N64 (which still remains my favorite of the bunch). As far as Wii games go, this one falls well short of the standard set my ""Mario Galaxy"" and ""Metroid Prime 3"". It's still fun, but it just isn't the game it could have been.Addendum: Let's not forgetThe ugly:1) Reviewers who insist that any criticism of a Wii game is obviously an attempt by PS3 ""fanboys"" to subvert the Wii. If your life worth depends on someone liking or disliking a game you purchased, you should get out more.""",3,"Solid title, but not the masterpiece it's been made out to be",2008/3/12 0:00
A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000FQ9R4E,"Cloud ...""""",0,0,"Let's face it, Super Smash Bros Brawl was without a doubt one of the most heavily anticipated games of this year. With heavyweights like Metroid, Mario and Zelda, Nintendo's machine was sure generating some good momentum but those games were more for the hardcore single player whereas Brawl's strengths best come when you're amongst friends that can play. Maybe it was because of that that I was reluctant to purchase it since I always played the machine by myself with no one to really call or was not too busy. But first playing among family members, the appeal of the game/series became easy to see. The single player is fun but to best get the game's positives, bring some friends.Story: No real story to speak of unless you take on the main single player mission which is quite long but the game's more a party game where you and up to 3 other players can battle each other or team up in certain special stages. As such, the game might not be as fun if it's just simply you although like the others in the series, the unlockables which contain trophies to new stages and characters, there's a lot to uncover within the game.Graphics: Of course there's an upgrade from Melee with more sharper character models, flashy effects like lighting, explosions and such but when you stack it against gorgeous games like Mario Galaxy or Twilight Princess, it's not really the most prettiest Wii title but then when you're fighting enemies, you can kind of care less about whether something isn't as sharp as it should be.Sound/Music: The music quite surprised as the game kicks off with a big cinematic intro complete with huge choirs and heavily orchestrated arrangements and throughout the game you can hear music that resembles the stage such as the Overworld Theme from Legend of Zelda to even those quirky songs with strange singing from Animal Crossing. Voice acting is just stuff like laughing, grunts and catch phrases from various fighters.Gameplay: The game hasn't really changed from the previous incarnations as far as controls but you can decide how you want to play: the traditional Wiimote/Nunchuk combo, Wiimote sideways NES-style, the Classic Controller or a Gamecube one. The moves are still relatively similar with minor changes according to the controller. Once you get the hang of how to fight, it's just a case of choosing your fighters. And like a lot of sequels, it adds and adds though that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. With returning favorites like Link, Mario and the Ice Climbers, we also get newbies like Sonic, Snake and Zero Suit Samus. Some are incredibly fun to use (Meta Knight) while others don't really seem that exciting to use. Never did like the Fire Emblem guys in the last one and still don't.Game modes are a-plenty from the Classic Adventure mode to the long Subspace Emissary where you can switch to different characters depending on the next chapter"" and friends can even join in on the fly so it's not just a single player or multiplayer experience right to the end. You get traditional fights to tournaments to specialty stages like survival mode and plenty more so you're bound to be busy for quite awhile. And let's not forget the most anticipated part: the online feature where you can head-to-head against people hooked up to the Net. I haven't had my Wii hooked up so I can't really give any details but it sure sounds like fun.I'd very much recommend Brawl even if it's just you but to get the most out of it, it's best to play with someone. Who knows? Maybe your parents can turn out to be ***-kickers.""",5,The best party you threw all in one disc,2008/3/29 0:00
A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000FQ9R4E,"Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...""",17,16,"Following in the footsteps of a game as widely acclaimed as Super Smash Brothers Melee for the Gamecube (with 7 million copies sold) isn't easy, even more so when there's a huge amount of hype surrounding the game as well. With that in mind, does Super Smash Brother Brawl live up to the legacy that Melee represents, or to the level that pre-launch material indicated? Short answer for both: reasonably so.Super Smash Brothers is a Nintendo crossover fighting game series featuring characters from almost every Nintendo franchise. Favorites like Mario, Link, Kirby and Samus duke it out in battles of up to four people on stages that are also taken from Nintendo series. Rather than direct combat, SSB focuses on the more cartoonish option of beating up an enemy and then launching them out of the stage with a powerful attack. Plenty of items and stage events keep the game an incredibly fun party experience.Brawl adds to the formula perfected in Melee by adding new characters, new items, and new stages, as well as some new features. There are a total of 26 characters; new additions to the cast include Pit from NES classic Kid Icarus, a Pokemon Trainer and three of his Pokemon, Pikmin's Captain Olimar, and the Mario series' villain/evil twin, Wario. Furthermore, two non-Nintendo characters are available, in a series first: Snake of Metal Gear fame and Sonic the Hedgehog both join the cast. In total, the cast additions include some pleasant surprises, but also some disappointing removals (characters like Roy and Mewtwo have been nixed, although they have been replaced with similar characters from newer installments of their respective series').There are a bevy of new items in the game. Foremost among these is the Smash Ball; when attacked enough, it grants the attacking character a Final Smash"" - a devastating attack that varies between different characters. For example, Mario shoots a screen-wide barrage of fireballs, Link catches one opponent in a Triforce symbol and slashes away at them, and Kirby cooks all his enemies in a giant pot. Unfortunately, some Final Smashes are copied or reused; for example, one hidden Zelda character copies Link's Final Smash exactly, and every character from Star Fox (three in all) use the Landmaster Tank as their Final Smash. However, some are definitely really neat and welcome changes to the gameplay - a sort of temporary bonus minigame for whoever manages to get the Smash Ball.Another new item is the Assist Trophy, which is similar to the Poke'ball item in that it summons an invincible helper to fight the enemies of whoever summoned them. For example, Samurai Goroh (from F-Zero) attacks enemies with a katana, as does Lyn from Fire Emblem (in a single swift cut). Kirby's friend Knuckle Joe delivers a barrage of blows and a mighty uppercut that KOs almost anything in its path. Little Mac from Punch-Out!! uses his speed and strength to deliver a startlingly fast jab. Jeff from Earthbound launches rockets at his enemies. Andross (in his Star Fox for the SNES incarnation) lurks in the background and shoots damaging 3d panels.  Not all of them have good effects, though; The Nintendog covers the screen, making seeing the battle almost impossible. Mr. Resetti from Animal Crossing goes on one of his famous rants, the text of which blocks the upper half of the battle completely. All of them contribute greatly to the chaos and hilarity of Smash Bros fighting.There are some new stages as well. The famous Bridge of Eldin from the Legend of Zelda serves as a long, flat stage occasionally broken by a bomb planted by a rampaging Moblin rider. The Frigate Orpheon from Metroid Prime occasionally flips upside down, causing the playing field to shift. Smashville is an Animal Crossing-themed level, and like its source will change depending on what time the level is played. Pictochat has the enemies fighting among the doodles and illustrations of the DS' built in chat program. Most of the new stages are good, but some of them (particularly Delfino Plaza from Super Mario Sunshine and Lylat Cruise from Star Fox Assault) are simply platforms on a moving background, and lack any real extra themes or effects. It's also possible to build your own stages with a variety of parts and backgrounds, which is a fairly intuitive process that can produce some insanely fun results.Besides multiplayer, the game has a new single player mode as well: ""Subspace Emissary"", a story told through cutscenes and action stages. The former are well directed but unvoiced / unworded, relying heavily on body language to get their message across. The story involves an evil plot to destroy the world of Smash Brothers perpetuated by the game's villanous characters (Bowser, Wario, and so on). The Smash Bros cast must team up - splintered at first, but then united - to combat this menace. The interactions between characters have some real gems - for example, Lucas from Mother 3 using the Pokemon Trainer as a sort of big brother role model, or Diddy Kong dragging Fox and Falco off to help him rescue Donkey Kong. The story is difficult to make out, however (though it's explained in detail on the Smash Bros. site), and the final boss is nothing short of eye-roll material (hint: he's a new original character, not an established Nintendo character). The story is mostly enjoyable for the little tidbits, and those are good and plentiful, so they make it worth it.The action stages are 2d side-scrolling classic platforming, with characters fighting against the mysterious and somewhat generic enemies unique to the game. The mechanics are similar to regular gameplay, but directed at a multitude of enemies rather than a small number of skilled opponents. Stages range from generic and boring to generic and frustrating - from ""random jungle"" to ""random ruins"" to ""random flying space-lab"". Other than the playable characters and some enemies from the Mario games, there's nothing ""Nintendo"" about the game mode - you feel like a Nintendo character playing in some other non-Smash Brothers game. So, in that way, this mode feels like it could've been done a lot better.Other bonus parts of the game include the return of trophies from Melee, new unlockable tracks for stages, and a variety of new event matches and sub-games. Furthermore - perhaps most importantly - the Wii allows SSBB to be played online, either with friends (added by inputting their unique code) or with strangers. This mode is pretty well coordinated, and there are no real complaints about it. The option also exists to spectate matches and bet on the winner, adding to the stylish, crowd-pleasing dynamic that the game entails.The gameplay as a whole is great, but it feels less sharp than Melee; some moves feel too slow, unresponsive, or just ""wrong"". The sense of controlled chaos that Melee evoked has been replaced by rampant and uncontrolled chaos, and a lot of the ""art"" of playing has gone out of it. The graphics are in general improved, with some good details on characters and stages, but for the most part everything's moving too fast to notice it. The sound is mostly improved - any poor changes in, say, the announcer's voice, or quality in general are offset by the sheer number of music tracks in the game.As a whole SSBB is a solid, fun, enjoyable game, with some minor bugs and annoyances. There's a lot added, but the jump from Super Smash Bros. to Melee feels stronger than the jump from Melee to Brawl. However, by itself it is a good game with a wide variety of characters and stages from every part of Nintendo's history.9/10.""",5,"Solid, Fun, Enjoyable Game",2008/6/17 0:00
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000FQ9R4E,"Michael Kerner Michael Kerner""""",98,82,"During the past year, Nintendo really showed what it takes with the success of the Wii. Dominant games like The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess and the definitive Super Mario Galaxy, really proved the Wii with its ultimate gameplay. But, that success has also been as a dominant question with Super Smash Brothers Brawl. While its prequel, Smash Brothers Melee was the biggest-selling title from Nintendo's last home console, the Gamecube, many still had wondered if Nintendo was going to be able to top that outrageous game of madness and excitement. Well, Nintendo has done it, and taken the brawl to a whole new level of fierceness. Its time to brawl!!Super Smash Brothers Brawl for the Nintendo Wii, is one of the most anticipated games to be released this year, and it absolutely dominates the competition. The gameplay is very addictive as you play with all your favorite classics characters like Mario, the adorable Yoshi, Link, the fierce Bowser and many others. There are also a lot of new characters here to unlock too like Sonic The Hedgehog, Wario, King Dedede from Kirby's Dream Land, Diddy Kong and Olimar from the overlooked Pikmin series. There are also secondary characters which have been added as well, that come and assist you to the depth of the gameplay like the Nintendogs, which block the screen so you can't see where your opponents are during the game, and Andross from the Star Fox series. The graphics look great, and appeal to each and every level you can challenge on from the abstractism of Warioware, to the madness of racing along the Mario Raceway from Mario Kart. Each level is packed with excitement for gamers of all ages.The control is also new to some gamers, and traditional for veterans too, as you can manuver your favorite characters 4 different ways: the Wii Remote alone, the Wii and Nunchuck controller, the Wii's classic controller and even the Nintendo Gamecube controller. The Wii controller and nunchuck take awhile to get used to, but the classic and Gamecube controllers work very well, making it simple and addictive gameplay. On top of that, you also can now challenge against others not just in the living room, but you can now also play against other Brawlers online through Nintendo's Wi-Fi connection, which makes the gameplay even more addictive for anyone who wants to brawl farther than they've ever done before.All in all, Super Smash Brothers Brawl is a must buy for anyone who owns the Nintendo Wii. It is just great from start to finish and brings in every depth of excitment and gameplay for a super smash for anyone who has the need to smash the competition. It is definitely a great game all around and a great addition to your Wii video game library.Graphics: A-Sound: A-Control: A for Gamecube and Classic Controller; B for Wii Remote & NunchuckFun & Enjoyment: B+ for solo gamers; A for multiplayer actionOverall: A-",5,Smashing Good Time,2008/3/9 0:00

The graphics r good for the wii especially for the charecters snake,Samus,and the ledgend of zelda series. this is not just brawling, it has much more themes like stickers,trophies,a chronicle of the nintindo systems and their hit games,a coin launcher,wi-fi,a better and great story mode,solo mode,and a stage builder. I just love this game, i can play it for hours and not get tired of it. There r much more items to have,much more stages,and much more charecters. The coin launcher is used to unlock trophies or stickers so u have more games unlocked to look at in the chronicle. It shows the hit games for the folowing systems,NES,SNES,GBC,virtual boy,Mr game and watch,Nintindo 64,GBA,GC,DS,and of corse the wii. U can also unlock music from the nintindo games and listen to them or put them on your custom stage. There is also a masterpecies section where u can play hit games from the NES to the nintindo 64. Some u have to unlock though. If u go to the trophy section u get to choose what game to look at then in the game u choose u can look at the Charecters and read about them and it even tells u what system the charecters or item is off of in the bottom of the screen. I could go on and on about how fun this game is but i do not have time and its already long enough and i know nobody will probley read this and im going on right now.

AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000FQ9R4E,"N. Durham Big Evil""""",74,60,"The highly anticipated Super Smash Bros. Brawl is here, and it lives up to every single ounce of the hype that has been surrounding it.  Make no mistake, Super Smash Bros. Brawl is one of the best games ever made for the Wii at this time, and the absolute best multiplayer game available for the system as well.  Starting off with a massive roster of fighters (some of whom have to be unlocked) including stalwarts like Mario, Link, Donkey Kong, Samus, Kirby, Pikachu, and Star Fox's Fox McCloud; to new characters to the series like Kid Icarus' Pit, Meta-Knight, Zero-Suit Samus, Fire Emblem's Ike, and to top it all off, Sega mascot Sonic the Hedgehog (!) and even Metal Gear Solid icon Solid Snake (double !).  Even with such an unorthodox roster of fighters, Super Smash Bros. Brawl manages to have a wonderfully balanced roster, no matter how ridiculous the game can get.  Graphically, the game has some flaws in terms of the details of the characters and environments, but these aren't all that noticeable thanks to the fact that the game is so insanely fun.  No matter if you play Super Smash Bros. Brawl online or offline, this is one of the most fun video games you will play on the Wii, or possibly any other system to boot.  Four-player mode is where the game really shines, as things just get even crazier.  Not to mention that you can also share game replays, screenshots, and even customized levels with others, which is a great little bonus feature in itself.  The only real other flaws here are that the game's Subspace Emissary stages, while fun, could have been better, and there are some long loading times to be found too.  Small flaws aside though, you simply can't go wrong with Super Smash Bros. Brawl.  There is a reason you got in a Wii in the first place, and it's because of nearly flawless, first party games like this.  If you own a Wii, you need to own Super Smash Bros. Brawl, it's just that simple.",5,"Spectacular, lives up to every bit of the hype",2008/3/9 0:00
A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B000FQ9R4E,"Richard Baker BinaryMessiah""""",0,0,"The Good: Fun fast paced action, tons of fighters and stages, simple controls, lots of customization, online play is a blastThe Bad: Overly simple fight system, many stages are bad, too many unbalanced characters, not enough modes, can get boring pretty quickThis is the fighting game all Nintendo fanboys live and die by. There's nothing wrong with that, Brawl is one of the most competitive fighters I have ever played. There's a huge lovable roster, tons of stages, and a lot of power-ups to turn the tide of the battle. With the addition of online play, this is any Wii owners dream come true.Once you select your character, a choice of many, you can select the color, and also various stages from Melee and different Nintendo franchises. You can choose which power-ups to disable as well, but I just couldn't get over the huge roster. Link, Peach, Mario, Luigi, Bowser, Kirby, Fox McCloud, Ganandorf, Sonic, Solid Snake, Samus Aran, Ness, Jigglypuff, Wolf, Captain Falcon, and a ton of others. This is a huge roster and nearly every character is recognizable. Once you get into the battle, that's where the fun begins.Brawl was confusing at first. It doesn't play out like normal fighters. There's no health meter, instead there's a percentage meter and your job is to keep yours down and get your opponent's up. You can reduce yours by eating food that falls, but the ultimate goal is to get the most KOs in one round. The controls are fairly simple, but take getting used to on the Wiimote. the best way to play is with a Nunchuk. Using the C stick to move around, A and B are your main attacks. B is your projectile/special and A is your normal attack. You vary the attacks but using different directions combined with these attacks. C allows you to jump and Z is your shield. This may seem way too simple compared to standard fighters, but it's kind of a breath of fresh air. The attacks look awesome, and the fighting is fast paced.Various power-ups fall on the battlefield like melee weapons, projectiles, and the one super finisher which is always fun. Hit this orb three times and you can unleash a deadly power attack. Just stand still and hit B. Some characters need to be close, some far away, and some hit the entire area and can't be avoided. These tend to be deal breakers for hardcore players, but they can be turned off. Honestly, the worst part about the game were how many bad stages there were. The ones where the levels constantly move up and down or to the right make the game feel like a platformer rather than a fighter. I hated these moving stages. It distracted from the core of the game. Some arenas were just way too small and there was no room to move around. There is a large enough variety though, so everyone will have favorites.Some characters are also unbalanced and over powered, while others are under powered. I felt Kirby, Samus, and Ness were over powered. On the flip side Zelda was under powered and felt boring to fight with, same goes with Wario. This may vary between players, but me and my partner both felt the same way. There is such a large variety that everyone will find there main character to fight with. I also found there was a lack of modes, with just Battle and online. The game is complete garbage with the AI, this game is only fun with another person.Overall, Brawl is a solid fighter that's fast paced and breaks away from the normal fighting formula. There are too many bad stages, over or under powered characters, and the game gets boring really quick due to the simple fighting system. The many power-ups will keep you busy and there are a lot of customization options, but in the end the game has limited appeal unless you are a hardcore Smash Bros. fan.",4,"A fun fighter, but very simple",2013/8/16 0:00
A2TCG2HV1VJP6V,B000FQ9R4E,Ryan Sil. (Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...,0,0,"You know, ever since the original Super Smash Bros, it was unbelievable to imagine several of Nintendo's franchises coming together and beat the ever-loving heck out of each other. The result was one of the best multiplayer experiences around. Then Melee came by and improved upon every single aspect of the original, as well as introducing things like Events, an Adventure Mode, and an All-Star mode. OH MY GOD!!! WHAT THE HECK IS BRAWL GONNA BRING US?! Just keep reading and you'll be shocked (That is, if you don't already own the game).Already, the character lineup is STUNNING. You've got characters from series like Zelda, Mario, Metroid, Pokemon, etc (And this should already appeal to fans everywhere), and now there are even MORE additions! Wouldn't you believe that Nintendo actually managed to bring SONIC and Metal Gear's SNAKE into the action! HOLY SHOOT! Can you imagine Mario and Sonic fighting evil side by side? Or maybe you can make them fight each other as if it is the Sega Vs Nintendo era all over again? The possibilities are endless!Speaking of endless possibilities, there's a freaking Stage Builder! This means you get to make your very own fighting arenas! Granted, there's limited things to put in, but just the privilege of being able to make levels can really keep you hyped! Look on the bright side: If you don't like the gimmicky fights in Brawl's own stages, you can just make your own.The stages themselves are extremely detailed and very creative! The gimmicks in each level help add to the intense fighting action. For example, in WarioWare Inc., (Which itself is a stage based off a minigame series, and it's very faithful. That alone deserves some praise) the players can actually compete in the minigames while fighting to earn prizes like temporary invincibility (Starman), or grow bigger!The Event Match mode from Melee has returned here, but this time, there are also events in which you and a friend could play together! Classic mode and All-Star mode also return, and of course, while they haven't truly changed, they certainly seem much better here, considering the amazing selections of characters and stages.Here's a cute bonus: Nintendo actually threw in demos of classic video games into Brawl! In the Masterpieces section, you can find trials of games such as Kirby's Adventure, Super Mario World, Ice Climber, F-Zero, Star Fox 64, etc.But that bonus is terribly pathetic compared to the game's Adventure mode! Aka the Subspace Emissary, this may as well have been sold off as its own game, but NO! Nintendo put this in as a BONUS! Think a game in which characters from several Nintendo franchises have come together and join forces to stop an evil demon-like creature that's messing with their world. THIS is that game! Sure, you are forced to play as certain characters at first (Like Mario or Pit from Kid Icarus), but eventually, you'll be loaded with almost all of the available characters in the game that you can choose from. There are also some amazing encounters with familiar good/bad guys as they are also involved with this epic plot (There is a part in which Fox and Diddy Kong fight the Pokemon, Rayquaza!). The Great Maze (Which is at the near-end of the game) left me grumbling, as it was very confusing to get past, but overall, I'm loving this!In case if you thought all of this was enough, think again; there's also online play. You can play online multiplayer against other people! Whether it's a 2 on 2 team match or every player for him/herself, I bet you'd have a very fun time playing! The only problem, though, is that the game sorta lags depending on how far away the players are from where you live. Also, the controls are slightly delayed, but fortunately, you can easily get used to it.There are other modes that I haven't really talked about for this review (Like Breaking Targets, Home-Run Contest, and Multi-Man Melee in which you fight a big number of easy-to-defeat polygonal characters), but this is already such a huge package that I'm sure you don't even need me to discuss them!Overall, there's a lot to love here for Nintendo fans. Heck, even if you AREN'T a Nintendo fan, I bet this game would get you interested! Plus, even if some game modes weren't really too great for you, there's still so much content that you'd enjoy otherwise that you might never get bored from this game! No Wii owner's library is complete without this game!",5,I'm in Nintendo Heaven! :'),2011/12/17 0:00

Rhodes,21,16,"Pros:+Several New Characters+Still fast paced, addictive gameplay+Tons of levels to explore+Tons of new items to mess around with+Adventure Mode is more engrossing and structured+Four ways to play+Online ModeCons:-Friend Codes make fighting with friends online a hassle-Without voice acting or written dialog, it may be hard to grasp what the story in Adventure mode is for a while-Long load times, especially in Adventure ModeThis review may be a little long.After countless delays, Super Smash Brothers Brawl is finally here, and it goes above and beyond Super Smash Bros. Melee in almost every way possible.The improvements over the previous Smash Brothers game are quite abundant.  There are now thirty five characters.  Fourteen of which must be unlocked first, either through several matches, classic mode or the games adventure mode.  There are also a plethora of new stages as well as a few classic ones thrown in from Super Smash Bros. Melee.  There are also new items and a whole new slew of extras to be found within this game.  Simply put, this game is huge and won't keep you busy for just weeks, but months on end.  Perhaps even years.There are two big single player modes to trump through.  First, there is classic mode which is not much different from the classic mode presented in Melee.  You'll fight battles either one on one, two on two, three on one or a giant version of a character.  There are also team battles and Metal Menaces"" to fight.  You'll also see the return of Master Hand and Crazy Hand.  Classic Mode can now be done with a friend instead of just by yourself as well.However, the real deal in single player is easily the Subspace Emissary.  Brawl's own adventure mode.  The adventure mode here actually includes a story.  The story is a little confusing at first.  Mainly because there's no voice acting or even written dialog between the characters.  You'll eventually grasp on to it, though, and even come to like it.  The story even comes off as somewhat epic.  The adventure mode here is much more fleshed out than in Melee.  You'll fight an abundance of characters and have an abundance of characters join your ranks.  You'll fight through chaotic boss fights and intricately designed levels.  And you don't even have to go through adventure mode alone.  A friend can fight alongside and many moments in the story call for more than one character to go through a certain level.  The other good thing about going through Adventure Mode is that it can be a different experience on a subsequent play.  Even better, however, is that the Adventure Mode is not that short.  It will easily take you anywhere from nine to ten hours to complete it the first time, and you'll end up having to play a second time just to snag all the trophies.Of course, the real treasure of any Smash Bros. game is the multiplayer aspect.  Brawl doesn't disappoint.  The matches are fierce and there are a ton of new things.  As in the previous games, players go to a level where they battle against either other players or the computer.  There are several new items added this time around.  There's the sticky bomb, which sticks to a character until it detonates.  There's the assist trophy which works a lot like the Pokeball and many more.  The most important new item, though, is easily the Final Smash.  The Final Smash is a devastating attack that usually serves as a one hit kill.  You'll probably want to check out every character's Final Smash skill at least once.  These aren't just the most powerful attacks in the game, they're some of the coolest looking as well.Super Smash Bros. Brawl also supports four different controller functions.  The Wii Remote by itself, the Wii Remote and Nunchuck, the Classic Controller and the Gamecube Controller.  All of these controls are decent, but the Gamecube controller is easily the best of the lot.  The controls are mapped out exactly like Super Smash Brothers Melee.  Anyone who played Melee to no end will easily find comfort in the controls here.  Regardless of what control function you use, the controls are tight and highly responsive.The best part about Brawl, however, may very well be all the extras.  You've got a series of trophies to collect and characters to unlock, but there's a lot more than just these things.  You can also unlock soundtrack selections and new stages as well.  In addition to all these things you can also save some matches and watch them again.  Brawl also gives you the option of creating your own levels and saving screenshots.  This is in addition to some of the things that returned from Melee such as Event Battles and the Homerun Contest.  There's so much to be explored within this game.  Brawl also goes online, and being able to fight people anywhere is amazing.Super Smash Bros. Brawl also looks and sounds incredible.  The graphics being the best the Wii has yet.  The stages themselves look absolutely incredible.  The backgrounds are highly detailed.  The music here is some of the best to grace the gaming world.  Nintendo got some of the most famous composers in the industry to contribute music and the soundtrack doesn't disappoint.Is Brawl perfect?  No.  While it's nice to go online you'll still have to deal with friend codes and there's no way to voice chat or communicate with the people you're playing against online.  When playing with friends, it'd be nice to be able to say something.  The game also suffers from some fairly long load times.  And while Adventure Mode is a treat, the last few hours of the run can become extremely repetitive.Despite all this, Super Smash Brawl is a must buy for Super Smash Brothers fans.  If you enjoyed Super Smash Brothers Melee and the original title that started it all, Super Smash Brothers Brawl is a real treat to own.""",5,Smashing,2008/3/9 0:00

Amazing animations, life-like visuals, great character models, incredible textures, awesome gun models outstanding VO (voice overs) and the explosions in this game never get old. This is one of the most atmospherics games ever, when you play this game you fell that your in a middle of a huge war. Grenades are blowing up everywhere and bullets flying every directions. This makes it a extremely intense game.The gameplay is also outstanding. When you are using a weapon, every bullet effects the enemies. And like i said before, this game is really intense so you never want to put the controller down. They also added a cover mechanic which works really well. There are many different environments you will be fighting on and the environments look amazing. Also there is a good variety in weapons. Every weapon is extremely fun. The A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) is also very smart. When you throw a grenade they will jump away and duck for cover.Also, Killzone 2 has one of the best multiplayer ive played so you will be playing this game for a very long time.BUY THIS GAME!!!!  andWhat a roller coaster ride this game is, it is like watching an action packed blockbuster that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the the film is finished........... But the difference with this is it is not a film and you feel that you are right in the middle of the action and any mistake you make will get you head blown off, until you realise that it is a game and still you get your head blown off.It is so fast paced that you have the sensation that the only time you can relax is when you get to the end of each episode and the game is saved............ You then take a deep breath and carry on eagerly with great trepidation.I love everything about this game, it's graphics, storyline, characters, scenery, the pace, the weaponry etc etc There is no doubt that it is a difficulty game to play and there are times when you scream profanities at the screen and wish it was a much easier game to play but what is the fun in that.........

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000FQBF1M,"Cloud ...""""",1,1,"Unlike most of the gaming community and the press especially, I wasn't overly hyped for Killzone 2. While I admit the trailers looked graphically stunning, the idea of another shooter where I shoot at enemies with a bunch of AI helpers was starting to get a little...old. However since I have a PS3 and a significantly smaller game library compared to my Xbox 360 library, I thought I'd give it a go since practically every PS3 owner will. However the more time I spent with the game, the more that certain issues started to creep up that never seemed to go away. Keep in mind, I wanted to love this game but the things the game does, well...I just couldn't wholeheartedly.Story: Seeing as how I never played the original, this is just going off the story found in this one. The ISA (Interplanetary Strategic Alliance) has decided to launch an offensive on the Helghast planet of Helghan and capture their leader, Scolar Visari. You play as Sev and go deep into the enemy stronghold/city of Pyrrhus to hopefully cripple the Helghast and become the victor.From a pacing standpoint, Killzone 2's story excels as the big firefights with you and your partner Garza will be mixed in with larger firefights involving your whole squad, turret guns, tanks and the like. But the characters are rather two-dimensional and aren't really given that much time to show depth. This is a balls-to-the-wall war game so it leaves all that sissy character development"" at home.Graphics: Right from that first trailer, everyone was floored at the visuals of the game and really showed people the power of the Playstation 3. Playing through the actual game reveals just as much attention to detail and a real sense of atmosphere. This is probably one of the more grimier and all-around colorless shooters around since it just looks so unfriendly. Enemy animations upon death are quite well-done as well (though their poking their heads out when they're in cover's funny) and character animations and designs are great as well. It also starts with a long and awesome cinematic movie meant to look like it was one shot. Kubrick would be proud...if he liked this kind of thing.Sound/Music: Like many war shooters, Killzone 2's sound is quite phenomenal and the all-around chaos of the battlefield really immerses you and makes you paranoid that an enemy is just waiting to take you down. Explosions and gunfire have a great kick and the score is frequently cinematic and scope and fits perfectly with the level. On the voice acting side, the Helghast's frequent yelling and swearing is amusing though your buddies seem to have a large love for profanity as ""s**t"" and ""f**k"" and variations thereof are frequently blurted out. All in all, everything about the sound and music is well-done but the voice acting is just...iffy.Gameplay: As anyone who's been in war will tell you, it helps to have a really solid team backing you up. Since you help them, they'll help you and stick together, and you win. What impressed me about the AI in Call of Duty IV is that they seemed to kill enemies a lot quicker than I could with my bullet already hitting a dead body. However, in this game the Helghast are fast and furious and your guys? Unhelpful is the word. I can't count how many times I was killed by an enemy they should've killed already. Or when we get ambushed only instead of taking cover, they just run around and stand there and occasionally do a 3-round burst while I'm doing all the legwork. Not to mention some of the level design makes it impossible to adequately take on the enemy. More often than not, I couldn't find a decent place to take cover since it left me exposed to a different group, moving only exposed me to a separate group whereas in games like Call of Duty or Gears of War the level design made it so that it was a reasonable challenge. Here it almost seems unfair. Add to that there's no visual indicator where you're shot so you can go ""oh okay, the enemy's on my right"" and several times I'd die and go ""where the hell was the guy anyway?"" I don't want to completely naysay the game on these parts but honestly I can't think of the game and not think of these issues.The other issue people have is in regards to the controls which have a weird sense of weight to them and almost feel sluggish. To a certain extent I agree and unlike other FPS games, I never felt ""comfortable"" playing this character where movements were natural. The default setting is a bit strange as well such as being in cover holding L2, leaning to the left or right and pushing in the right analog to aim down the sight which would be okay but I prefer others where you aim using the LT/L2 and fire with RT/R2. Then there's the Circle button acting as your action prompt, the ladder crawls, bomb plantings and such. Whereas in other FPS games this is a dual-layered button with usually X or Square acting not only as reload but action prompts but also the ""use item"" button. Having melee moved to L1 is a bit different and not as natural as using the Circle or B button on 360 games. Oh yeah and firing a sniper rifle? You have to press in the analog and instead of pressing it again to zoom closer, you have to press Up on the D-pad. While you can change button layouts, it's just not a very intuitive control scheme, particularly when other FPS' seem to have perfected them.Is there fun in the game? Of course since the gun battles are frequently intense and adrenaline-pumping but the real meat is in the multiplayer. Unlike other multiplayer games such as the Darkness and the recent Riddick game seem to have multiplayer just for the sake of having multiplayer, Killzone 2's MP and its community make it a worthy return-to along the Halo's and Call of Duty's since it's quite fun and probably get more enjoyment out of this mode than the single player. What the multiplayer in Killzone 2 boils down to is its use of badges, or essentially, classes. Want to bring people back to life so they don't respawn at the other end of the map? Be a medic. Want to set up defensive turrets or even repair the standing ones? Be an engineer. Prefer being sneaky and disguise yourself as a member of the other team? Saboteur. And personal favorite, the Scout, which can turn invisible if you don't move and comes equipped with a sniper rifle so you can snipe people halfway across the map and they'll go ""who the hell shot me?""My one complaint is the requirements to get the additional abilities. At times you might find yourself unable to meet the requirements to get the ribbons because not enough people died by a certain thing such as a flying drone or turret etc, I haven't even made a dent in the Close Quarters one which needs a certain amount of melee kills while assassination kills are usually taken by another member of your team or they survive. Also it's not like you level up one class individually, they have to be earned with the Scout being way at the end. It might make some matches not as fun since you can be up against several snipers who have better abilities/set-ups than you do.Looking at Killzone 2 as a PS3 exclusive makes it a noteworthy game to the Playstation 3's library but as a game I just couldn't get into it as much as I want to. Despite this I'm giving it a 4 star rating since the amount of time and care the game developers took for the game as well as the multiplayer makes it good enough to play but I don't know, guess I was just expecting this to be an absolutely stellar game. Instead, it's just good to great.""",4,Shoot them right between their red eyes,2009/4/8 0:00
A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000FQBF1M,"Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...""",3,2,"A military sci-fi first-person shooter for the PS3, Killzone 2's semi-futuristic look attempts to appeal both to the Halo crowd and the Call of Duty crowd. As a whole, it has plenty of its own merits, but doesn't really live up to the legacy of either series.Killzone 2 depicts a war between the good guy"" ISA and the ""bad guy"" Helghast. The former are conventional-looking space marines, while the latter are clad in gas masks and bulky gear. Really, though, the storyline acknowledges that there aren't many differences between the two sides morally; both sides are guilty of various war crimes, and so on. Otherwise, the story is completely standard for a space-based game. In single player, you play as an ISA special forces soldier fighting through waves of enemies to try to capture the Helghast leader. In multiplayer, you take on the role of a soldier on either side of the conflict.The game's FPS system is nothing particularly special. Killzone 1 made an effort to show the player's body, for example when climbing ladders. This was meant to be different than older games that treated the player like a box with a gun strapped to it. In Killzone 2, that spirit is alive, but it's no longer ""unique"", so it just feels like a standard FPS. The weapons handle somewhat poorly, but not in a badly-designed way; rather, it feels like the game is trying to emulate the difficulty of actually handling weapons. The player moves and turns slower than many other First Person Shooter characters. Additionally, for whatever reason peripheral vision is poorly represented in the game; playing online, I was often ambushed - and was able to easily ambush others - from their side, and generally nobody attacked from the side noticed they were being shot at until they had already died. There is also a cover system available in single player mode, where the player takes cover and ducks out to shoot; oddly, this system is not usable in multiplayer, and players must make do with ducking behind cars or walls.The game has a fairly standard complement of weapons, with a few more unique guns in the single-player mode. Both the ISA and Helghast have a standard assault rifle (though the ISA's rifle has a better sight than the Helghast one), and there's the usual assortment of shotguns, submachine guns, sniper rifles, and rocket launchers. In the campaign, more exotic guns are featured; flamethrowers, bolt-guns that staple enemies to the wall, and lightning guns. All of these guns have fairly detailed reactions from their victims, which is at least more interesting than the standard ""shoot them and they die"". Finally, there are two types of grenades: frag grenades, which can be ""cooked off"" to detonate on impact, and lightning grenades, which shoot out tendrils of lightning instead of exploding. Neither is thrown particularly well, and they usually seem to fall short of where they ought to go.Multiplayer is one of the main attractions of the game; its primary feature is how it handles game modes. When you go into a game, each map is divided into multiple rounds. Each round is a random game type (depending on the server), so you can have a regular Team Deathmatch followed by a Capture The Flag round followed by a Bomb-Planting mode. This makes for a more fun and dynamic mix than most games, where you end up playing the same game mode all the time. The game modes also do a good job of staying reasonably in-character, rather than being outlandish or ridiculous; the ""capture the flag"" mode is actually grabbing a single propaganda speaker and putting it in a safe location, rather than stealing an enemy's flag from their base. Multiplayer also contains a class system, similar to Battlefield or Team Fortress. At the start, the player can only use the Soldier class armed with a default assault rifle. As they play the game, they gain points that grant them levels. Leveling up grants new weapons for the soldier class and entirely new classes. The soldier class is the most widely armed class, as it can be equipped with an assault rifle, a shotgun, a submachine gun, a light machine gun, or a rocket launcher. The medic class can only be armed with an assault rifle, but is capable of reviving near-dead allied units. The engineer class has a shotgun and can build sentry turrets and ammo boxes. The tactician class can set new spawn points for allied units and call in air strikes. The assault class runs faster and has more health than a normal soldier, but can only be armed with explosive weapons (not good for close-combat situations). Saboteurs can disguise themselves as members of the enemy team and throw C4. Finally, scouts are the only class capable of wielding sniper rifles; they also have the ability to cloak themselves and mark enemy units with data that's transmitted to allied units (so that everyone can see where an enemy is).In addition to direct leveling-up, there are certain actions that give permanent rewards. For example, having ten games where you score more than ten kills grants you an extra frag grenade on every spawn, while having ten games where you score 20 points and don't kill yourself or any allies grants you more ammo. These kinds of bonuses are primarily useful for longevity; that is, they don't affect actual combat, but just allow you to get more done without having to go back to an ammo resupply (which is useful in and of itself).The multiplayer maps are probably the game's best point. Ranging from urban environments to military bases to remote wasteland villages, the maps are huge without being overwhelming. They add to a feeling of having an entire battlefield, and combat will generally move around to different points of the map based on objectives. Therefore, it avoids what a lot of games have where combat always ends up being in the same spot. It's also a lot less linear than a lot of FPS maps, allowing keen players to sneak around the enemy lines and take them from behind.As a whole, Killzone 2 is a solid game. There's nothing new or unique about it, but it works and it's fun. Currently, it doesn't have a lot of competition on the PS3 (whereas with an Xbox release it would have most likely been overshadowed by Halo 3), so PS3 owners owe it to themselves to buy this. However, by itself, it's not worth buying a PS3 for.We purchased Killzone with our own personal funds.Rating: 8/10.""",4,attempts to appeal to Halo and Call of Duty crowd,2009/12/17 0:00

Saying Killzone 2 blows away its predecessor is a gross understatement, as the game lives up to the hype that has been surrounding it since said trailer saw the light of day, and is an absolute must own for every PS3 owner.  The first thing you'll notice about Killzone 2 is that the game is quite simply a sight to behold.  The graphics, overall visuals, and art design that the game boasts are possibly the best to grace the console yet, and the game's sound effects and design are spectacular.  Besides the game's technical achievements, Killzone 2 offers a frantic single player campaign that, while a bit on the short side, boasts some challenging enemy AI and a wonderful array of weapons at your disposal.  The online play however is where Killzone 2 really shines, as the game features some intricately designed multiplayer maps and plenty of rewards that only add to the overall fun that the game has to offer.  While Killzone 2 is definitely a technical powerhouse that delivers what FPS fans look for, it still isn't the Halo killer that Sony has proclaimed it to be in the past.  Despite that though, Killzone 2 is a stunning and spectacular achievement that every PS3 owner should own.  Slowly but surely the PS3 is getting a solid lineup of great, exclusive, triple-A titles that PS3 owners have been long overdue in having.

Now that 5 years has rolled around Killzone 2 is considered one of the best FPS games every made and is winning multiple game of the year awards as we speak, and was made the best looking game of all time (during it's release), and looked 100 times better than Halo 3. Not only that but back in 2005 every criticized the game for being pre-rendered because no one thought this kind of stuff could be done on a game console. Even on terms of multi player Killzone 2 really impresses with a strong ranking system, squads, voice chat, clans, and the works.The weakest part of Killzone 2 may be its story and characters. Instead of playing as Templar like the first game you play as Sev and fighting alongside a squad of three Garza, Natko, and Rico (the only one from the original game). The war against the Halghans isn't over so the only option is to storm the Visari Palace and take Visari down once and for all while fighting against a cruel general hellbent on getting the ISA's nuke codes.Not only is the game lacking solid story and characters it is very short. You can beat the game in about 6-8 hours depending on your play style so it will leave you wanting way more. One thing that impressed me a lot was the clever level design: The levels make you really thing about your strategy on how to attack enemies and this includes the weapons as well. Each one is unique and can only be used in certain situations, and there is a smorgasbord of them to boot. You have flamethrowers, rocket launchers, shotgun, and other sorts. Each weapon feels powerful and packs a good punch especially when your shotgun takes off a head at point-blank. You cn mount turrets, and even drive vehicles at a couple of points. Now when it comes to Sixaxis control the game uses it very poorly in only three ways. You can turn valves, set charges, and move the loading screens hologram around. Not very exciting, and I was expecting some pretty good use out of it with an epic game like Killzone 2.If you have a HDTV the game will blow your mind visually and audibly thanks to its impressive next-gen showcase. The graphics are amazing with super high res textures that have never been seen before. This stuff looks like pre-rendered next-gen graphics, but in real-time. While the game doesn't have much color that is ok because there is a distinct art style. There is lots of ambiance on top of all this that makes you feel like you are in a war-torn planet fighting for your race.If there is one thing I absolutely love about this game it is the Helghast design. They are such cool characters with creepy glowing red eyes, raspy voices that are only heard through gas masks, and strange British accents. The gritty art style is great and really fits this type of game despite everyone complaining about next-gen games not having enough color.The multi player is the meat of the game with up to 32 players on each map and everything gets really insane really fast. It takes awhile to get a hang of how everything is done and the fast pace. When I first went online I died about 100 times before I even made my first kill, and no I don't suck. After you get the hang of everything it becomes super addictive and fun. There are plenty of modes from team deathmatch, to search and destroy, and even a king of the kill type game.For people who just got a PS3 for Christmas Killzone 2 is something to really show off to your friends, and with great mutliplayer you can expect lots of hours playing this great next-gen gem.""",4,An amazing sequel to a once hated series,2012/3/28 0:00

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000FQBPCQ,"Cloud ...""""",3,3,"For some people, there hasn't been a proper"" Zelda title since Majora's Mask. While Wind Waker was indeed an incredibly solid title, a ridiculous amount of people wrote it off and probably never played it because of the graphical style. With people longing for a more ""Ocarina of Time""-like feel have got their wish with Twilight Princess. Utilizing the Wii's remote-sensing technology, this is probably the most different Zelda you've played yet the most familiar. Time will tell whether this'll eclipse Ocarina but it's sure exceptional so far anyway.Story: In probably the most melancholy and darkest entry so far, Link starts out as a citizen of Ordon Village who's tasked to deliver something to Hyrule Castle. However, he's attacked and children are kidnapped. Trying to save them, he gets thrown into an unusual world known as the ""Twilight world"", with strange enemies and a foreboding atmosphere. Worse is that Link transforms into a wolf whenever he's there but at least he has help with Midna, a strange character who bosses him around. Putting Hyrule back to normal and beating those responsible is one of many things you'll have to look forward to.Graphics: When I first played the game, it was in 480i and even then I thought the graphics looked great. But upgrading to 480p is a huge improvement as lighting is more fantastic and bright, water and streams are more lifelike and areas such as Zora's River and especially the Springs where spirits are found just look gorgeous. Sure it doesn't look as next-gen as others but you have to admit, these graphics are a pleasure to look at and I never get sick of em.Sound/Music: Some sound effects actually come from the controller's speaker such as Midna laughs, sword sheathing or that familiar puzzle ringing when you solve something. The music is very good with plenty of beautiful themes and big epic splendors but while it would've been nice if it was orchestrated, this'll do. As usual with Zelda, there's no voice acting to speak of save for yells or character making groaning or happy noises.Gameplay: The nunchuk controls Link, Z-button is for targeting, C is camera and if you swing the controller, Link does a spin move. As for the remote, the D-Pad acts as a item setter where you can assign an item to one of the directions (except Up, as that's your Midna guide) and it'll assign that item to B. Swinging the remote will make Link slash. Only problem with both is that doing the spin gets irritating since it might not happen when you need it to (a horse battle early on was frustrating as hell because of this). But I don't think I'd go back to manual aiming with an analog stick after the immensely accurate remote aiming. A target will appear on screen should you use, say a bow and arrow and I've found I was deadly accurate, picking off enemies that weren't even remotely near me.As for the wolf part, it's actually not as cumbersome as I thought it would be. Basic controls are the same except A is for attacking. Instead of items, Link turns on a ""sense"" which can locate either ghosts, parasite bugs and others. Also in sense mode are dig spots where Link can dig up hearts, rupees or locate secret entrances. As for faults, aside from the aforementioned spin attack, the game is not really difficult but this is no cakewalk in the park either. If enemies don't give you pains, the dungeons and puzzles will which might range from frustrating to smack-in-the-head obvious.Most of the Wii games I've noticed are either novelty games where it's just about using the controllers in weird ways such as Cooking Mama or just simply ports with Wii controls (which almost always seem awkward), games such as Twilight Princess are for hardcore gamers that want a long and involving quest to spend nights trying to master.""",5,"A masterpiece, plain and simple",2007/1/30 0:00
A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000FQBPCQ,"Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...""",430,408,"Zelda Twilight Princess has been eagerly awaited by legions of Zelda gaming fans. This version features a more adult Link who rides a horse, swings a sword and saves the day.The title is available for both the GameCube and the Wii, and there are definitely some advantages with the Wii. First, you can see the game in 480p, which is DVD quality. It's not quite high definition, but it's still quite nice! Second, you get widescreen, which means you get much more game to see on the screen. Finally, you get to use the motion sensing controllers on your Wii to swing your sword, go fishing, aim your slingshot, and much more.First, the gameplay. Most gamers will be thrilled to hear that Link is less cartooney in this game. That's not to say it's a mature title - it's still a game without blood. You kill evil enemies who vanish in a puff of smoke. You go on a variety of quests, and it's very much good-against-evil. Rather, with this Link you're not a little 6 year old on a toy sailboat. Your Link is in his late teens, has his own house, owns a horse. He is harassed by three little tykes, but there's a certain young lady whose large eyes catch at Link's heart.In no time at all Link is out in a world which is not all butterflies and daffodils. There are dark things afoot in Hyrle. The land is covered in twilight, and you turn into a wolf to deal with the shadows. Your senses serve you well in this realm. It's not too scary for kids - but it gives the game much more depth for older players.The graphics are rather impressive for a Link game. Remember, the game is still a cartoon, so you're not seeing detailed tanks or the pores in the characters faces. The world you are in is stylized. There is plenty of detail in 480p - or even in regular TV resolution - to show the orange pumpkins, green vines, and fluffy white chickens which make up Hyrule. The water ripples, the dust billows and the fire flickers in the fireplace.How about the sound? The Link games were famous (or notorious) for the silly noises characters make. None talk. I suppose this makes it easy for them to convert the game to every language in the world - they just change the text out and are all set. Also, you can change your name and your horse's name without any speaking issues. The voices might not know how to pronounce Shadowfax"".Gameplay is just amazing in its length and depth. There are numerous worlds to traverse and dungeons to delve into. There are the standard collection of mini-games, quests, things to collect, puzzles to solve. You could easily play this for months and not be done. This isn't a game to race through to say ""I solved it"" and move on to something else. It's a world to immerse yourself in, to get to know every hill and dale, to track down those secret locations.I really like how the Wii controllers integrate into the game. It's not like you are using them constantly, getting exhausted with hand movements. Instead, you do a fair portion with the regular joysticks for fine movement. The joysticks are used in a more general way, for sweeping sword attacks or relaxing fishing. You can use small movements if you want - but it's much more fun if you get into the spirit of things and swing away. Just make sure you have that wrist strap properly connected!Downsides? The little ""he he he"" voices can get annoying quickly, especially if you are stuck on a puzzle and they are tormenting you. Sometimes the checkpoints send you back further than you might like.They do a good job of giving you little nudges if you get stuck, helping you figure out your way through the puzzles.In general, I think they struck a great balance between ""tame enough for younger kids"" and ""in depth enough for older players"". There are a lot of teen and adult Zelda fans out there, and they'll be quite pleased with what the game offers. This is definitely one of those must-have for gamers who like adventure games even the slightest!""",5,"Great, Involving Gameplay for All Ages",2006/11/23 0:00

Although the most popular one is Mario, there are ones who continued to be as surprising. The Legend Of Zelda is no acception. The epic game series featuring Link has redefined what epic games should be. Although that also could be said with new video game systems as well. For Nintendo, they wanted to break it wide open with their new console, the Wii. But, with a new system, can Link and his new quest deliver on the Wii, the same way Zelda games have thrived before like Ocarina Of Time delivered? Here is the review.The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess for the Nintendo Wii, is a wild and outrageous epic that shines brighter than any Nintendo game released in a long time. The objective of the game is simple, Link is back and he is learning his way through another quest, when during one split second, he is transformed into a wild wolf. Along the way, he has to battle shadow demons and reclaim the light that once thrived in Hyrule which was stolen by the vile Ganondorf. The graphics for the game are breathtaking, just like the edition for the Gamecube, and the feeling of the music thives with each portion of the game from the Forest Temple to the Baron Woods. The control is a bit tricky for new Wii gamers, but it is very simple to pick up, after a bit of practice, especially with the shooting with the slingshot, and the way you move the Wii controller.All in all, I was very impressed with The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess. It is definitely one of the most outrageous games ever released in a long while, but for anybody who is a die hard fan of the series, it is definitely worth it. I definitely recommened this for anyone who has the Wii, or wants the new Nintendo system. It is worth the money, and the tri-force that is with you.Graphics: ASound: AControl: BFun & Enjoyment: B+Overall: B+",4,Wii And Link,2006/12/24 0:00

Since, I had been an exclusive PC gamer - until last Christmas. So one can imagine how very pleasantly surprised I was when I discovered that this is a whole new ...sword-game.The world is immense and beautiful and mostly open-ended. The graphics may be inferior to the latest PC games (Wii graphical capabilities are not one of its strong-points) however, I cannot remember when cutting-edge graphics were essential in the enjoyment of any cRPG. Having said that, the environments (from the grass and the creeks to the trees and the skies) have been designed to maximize the console's potential in most instances.Not so with the sound: good music but low quality sound. And the dialogues are still scripted, not voiced. It makes no sense to hire top talent to compose the themes and sounds - only to present them badly.The use of the motion-sensing Wii-Remote together with the Nunchuk follows a steep learning curve. Once mastered though the real fun begins. Moving with the Nunchuk and fighting with the Remote make the game such an immersive experience. Swinging the Wii-Remote actually swings Link's sword - and aiming in the screen will ail your arrows and projectiles.It surprised me and brought back memories at the same time - and I had not have so much fun in years.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5,THE MAGIC OF THE TWILIGHT,2010/2/11 0:00

I pick it up and play longer than I care to, hoping I'll begin to see what everyone else is crazy about where this game is concerned; but I've yet to take a liking to it. It is certainly an RPG. You'll do lots of talking to random people (catching small glimpses of the grander story unfolding), improving your abilities, and adventuring in general. But the graphics leave quite a bit to be desired, there's a LOT of reading to be done here, most of the characters fail to be interesting, and the majority of tasks I've been hit with have been bland or felt tedious. The controls handle pretty decently and the soundtrack is better than some (it hasn't grown to be annoying yet, at least). All in all, this game doesn't break new ground or even push the envelope further than other games already have. I feel like I'm still playing Ocarina. Most people have no problem with that. And I'm sure that's why the ratings for this game are as good as they are. But my expectations for this game were much higher than they should have been. The further you go into this experience, the better it's going to get. So if you play it long enough, you'll start getting more of the action you long for. But it could be better in almost all aspects. So I'm rating the game what I feel it ends up being; 3 stars. Rent it first. For, as you can probably tell by looking at other reviews, my opinion isn't everyone's. But it is my hope that an honest opinion, such as this is, does not go unappreciated.

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000FQBPCQ,S. Rhodes,10,9,"The Legend of Zelda is one of the most popular games of all time. When a new Zelda game marches forth, the fans are always there. Now, after spending years in development, with delay after delay and ultimately being pushed onto the Nintendo Wii, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is finally here.Twilight Princess is by far one of the most instantly absorbing in the series.  The game begins with you as Link in the village of Ordan.  Things are going well for Link and his friends until a band of monsters riding a boar come and kidnap two of his friends.  When Link awakens, he's suddenly thrust into a twilight realm where he meets a creature named Midna, who decides to aid Link on his quest.  From the get go, The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess is instantly absorbing.  The storyline is by far one of the best in the series and is very engrossing and absorbing.The control scheme is not so bad at all. You'll control Link using the remote and nunchuck attachment. Swinging the remote makes Link swing his sword. It doesn't take a lot of work to do it either. A simple flick of the wrist is all it takes to make Link swing his sword.  In addition, shaking the nunchuck causes him to do his famous spin-slash attack. The controls are surprisingly fluent and very well responsive. Its an interesting way to play Zelda, and there's no steep learning curve to it.The heart of the challenge from the game mainly comes from the puzzles rather than the actual dungeon crawl itself. Simply because once you do get used to the Wii remote and controls you'll have a pretty easy time getting through the dungeons.  The game provides a targeting system for you, and so you'll find it really easy. Using projectiles like the slingshot is also made easier with the Wii remote.  You simply aim at objects and fire.  If you miss its entirely your own fault.A unique twist to the gameplay of Zelda is that Link not only goes around in his normal form, but can become a wolf as well.  As a wolf the controls are virtually the same with the exception of Link being able to use senses and dig.  You'll also be forced to solve puzzles in wolf form as well, and it does indeed add some variety to the game.  As you progress in wolf form, Midna sits on your back and is there to offer advice for you.  Gameplay wise, Twilight Princess knows how to keep you immersed in the game.Visually its hard to judge Twilight Princess. Its a pretty game, but as you probably expected it pretty much looks like a late Gamecube release. This may be because Twilight Princess wasn't intended for the Wii in the first place, but the Gamecube.  To the games credit though, it has a lot of detail going for it. Link has never looked better. The land of Hyrule has never looked better.  Your enemies and some of the cinematics also sport some awesome detail.  So while it does look like a late generation Gamecube game, keep in mind that it still looks good and that it probably even looks smoother and runs better on the Wii.  Load times are virtually non-existant here.The music still sounds pretty good. A lot of tunes you'll recognize from previous Zelda adventures, but the new stuff sounds pretty good too. There's no voice acting, though, and that still bothers me about Zelda to this day. The Windwaker could've used voice acting and so could Twilight Princess. The story is so absorbing, and it probably would've been better had they added voices to it. Link grunts and such and from time to time one of the NPC characters might yell something, but there's really no spoken dialogue throughout the game.  It would've been really exciting to see some of the cinematics brought to life through fantastic voice acting.  In the long run this probably won't bother anyone, and its a small price to pay for a game that's as fantastic as this.For what its worth, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is very good. Its by far the most absorbing story in the entire series, and its gameplay is unmatched. Fans who have followed Zelda since its days on the NES will be pleased at just how far the series has come with Twilight Princess. Its one of the best in the series.The Good+Absorbing story+Fantastic Gameplay+There's a lot of great detail given to the game+The puzzles are quite challenging+The game still sounds goodThe Bad-Graphicwise, its really pretty, but you can't help but admit its just a late Gamecube game-All this time and the series still lacks voice acting",5,Absorbed in Twilight,2006/11/25 0:00
A2LPJD19MGBNXJ,B000FQBPDU,"Adrian Jenkins southerndudeman""""",18,10,"I managed to purchase Metroid Prime 3"" yesterday, and after one night of play, I can say that it's a very strong title. The game continues the story of bounty hunter Samus Aran...somehow. I don't really know, and don't really care. The games really exist apart, and their story is fairly minimal.The first addition I am pleased with are the voices. Nintendo seemed allergic to voice on its GameCube titles, opting instead for some weird combinations of grunts and sighs. It was OK for Metroid, because usually you interacted with aliens anyway. Now, however, we hear the voices of humanity, and they sound good. Not great, but perfectly adequate.The graphics are solid, but not nearly as stellar as some would have you believe. I've read numerous places that these graphics give the PS3 and XBox2 a run for their collective money - it's a lie. Still,  the scenery is crisp, the characters look organic in their environments, and all in all, it is aesthetically pleasing.The control scheme is...perplexing. The placement of the buttons on the Wii controller often leave much to be desired (firing a missile by pressing down on the crosspad is particularly annoying, since missiles are so important in the quest). The jump and fire buttons seem backward to me. Using the point-and-click method to fire is excellent, but using the Wii remote to turn your character is frustrating - in the heat of a pitched battle (such as the first dangerous boss fight against Iceman), you will find yourself often tracking off of the screen, wasting valuable time in the process. In general, there is some fine-tuning missing here, and this is why I drop the game's rating one star. Essentially, the game sometimes moves too fast for the controller. It makes for a frantic experience, but it is frustrating for the precision gamer.The bosses (well, at least the first few) are great. You'll see some new faces (the Iceman encounter is incredible), and some old favorites. But all in all, they are very imaginative, and very fun to fight.Travel has been VASTLY improved. Although backtracking remains necessary, the game has a built-in teleport feature, via Samus' ship. Each world has a few landing points, and any landing point may be used as a jumping off point to any other area. Excellent job, guys! Metroid Prime 2 was incredibly painful precisely BECAUSE of this backtracking. It doesn't seem to be a problem here.The game has a nice extra system, for those interested. Rather than being forced to finish an entire game, or find EVERY scan in the game, each triumph brings a little reward in the form of a credit. These credits are then used to purchase extras such as music, artwork, etc. There is also some ""friend"" system in place, but I haven't used it at all (I don't even have my Wii online).So, long story longer, this is a great game. I'm not sure it's the masterpiece some are making it to be, but it's the most solid Metroid Prime title to date. However, the controls are quite annoying.""",4,"A great title, but the control isn't all its cracked up to be...",2007/8/30 0:00
A2582KMXLK2P06,B000FQBPDU,B. E Jackson,45,13,"Yes, because Metroid is one of Nintendo's most long-running and successful gaming franchises, Metroid Prime 3 had no choice but to be created and released. But you know, it's certainly nowhere *near* a classic because it's basically a watered down, less interesting sequel but with slightly improved graphics and sweet-looking explosions.  Actually, the explosions aren't necessarily better than the first two Prime games, but I found myself admiring them more this time around (perhaps because I was bored out of my mind in so many other ways).Remember the original Metroid on the NES, Metroid 2: Return of Samus on the Game Boy, and Super Metroid on the Super NES? These games were released a long time ago, and what made them so fantastic was how the gameplay emphasis on each of them was on exploration"".In Metroid Prime 3, you predictably go through one hallway after another shooting whatever you see. While it's somewhat fun, the lack of exploring hurts the game a LOT and prevents it from having much in the way of replay value. I also hate how it takes such a long time to defeat some of the bosses in the game. It was never like that in the past (playing the 2D Metroid games, I mean).  Are you kidding me?  20-30 minutes to completely eliminate ONE boss battle?  Why in the heck does it take so darn long???  This complaint holds true with the previous two Prime games as well.  That's a major, unforgiveable problem.Also, and this is a pretty big complaint, the regular enemies you encounter while going through these numerous, one-way hallways are usually small, horribly animated, and just boring to watch/fight.  NOTHING compared to the enemies in the first two Prime games.  We're talking dreadfully boring enemies to the point you sometimes find yourself just preferring to run past them and not waste a single moment fighting them.  I'm extremely disappointed here.  It makes me think the third installment in the series is an obvious milk job by Nintendo.Besides the first hour of the gameplay being extremely tedious and boring because you're doing nothing but talking to soldiers like it's a borderline RPG game, exploring generic computer rooms that we've seen to death in thousands of other video games, and admiring constant blue/grayish colors throughout *every* single wall located on *every* single hallway (yes that's sarcasm) the game eventually changes so you're exploring different areas of land by way of your spaceship.  Too bad each of these lands ends up missing the mark and looking rather dull compared to the previous Metroid Prime games.  Actually it's more like a poor imitation of previous efforts.That's not quite the biggest issue I have with the exploration feature however.  The BIGGEST problem is that the game is nothing more than a lengthy series of miniature and narrow hallways constantly taking you to even MORE miniature and narrow hallways.  You're probably wondering why I keep saying ""narrow"" and it's because, for the most part, the hallways are exceptionally tiny and uninteresting.  It's like so much effort was put into the background graphics (which are overrated by the way- the game doesn't look *that* great) that the development team thought they could get away with slacking off on the level design.  I don't think so- if a game's not fun to play, it's not worth my time.  Basically no matter where your ship goes small hallways will definitely be in store for you.  The areas that are actually fairly beautiful are usually either too short so you never feel obligated to stop and take notice, or appear like an obvious rehash of the places you were already fascinated by in Prime 1 and 2.Ice missiles are a really bad idea.  Yes, you can freeze the lava and make a walkable platform for yourself.  Who cares?  These aren't the kind of improvements that take advantage of the Wii's capabilities.  It's not the kind of improvements to shell out money for either.  Grappling doors and enemies isn't very fun either.  In fact, you might even say it's downright cheap.  While grappling an enemy, most likely another enemy from off-screen will shoot laser balls at Samus and drain a good deal of your health.  Meanwhile you can't do a darn thing about it because you're stuck in the grappling position with the first enemy.  Oh sure, this entire process only takes a few seconds (by either letting go of the grapple or going through with it and removing the enemies shields) but SEVERAL of the space creatures in the game are frantic laser ball-shooting maniacs, so it only take a few seconds to empty good chunks of your life energy.  This means you need total preparation to deal with these tough enemy situations but unfortunately the unfair and relentless nature of their ways makes it a needlessly tough task.Lock onto enemies, fire repeatedly until they die, rinse and repeat.  It's predictable and boring now.  This is exactly what you'll be doing the entire way through.  You'll most likely be doing it while being forced to deal with unavoidable laser ball blasts by the space creatures.  I prefer the 2D games where you actually had to aim and practice your skills to eliminate the bad guys.  With enough practice you'd actually be able to *master* the games.  This is probably not entirely THIS games fault- but 3D games in general.  Ugh, enough is enough.Speaking of the Wii, who's bright idea was it to make the game so you actually have to turn and pull on the Wii remote to do certain commands involving opening doors and whatnot?  Yes, I'm referring to grappling again.  No, you don't have to do these commands for EVERY door you walk through- just specific ones.  It's still a terrible idea and it's more annoying than anything else.Speaking of doors, why in the WORLD does it take 10-15 seconds to load a door?  Are you kidding me?  This game was released in 2007 (not 1996) so it's absolutely pathetic that we have to sit there and wait for the doors to open, especially when this wasn't even a problem in the first two Prime games.  Ridiculous.  Also -while waiting for a door to open up- make sure you've taken care of all the enemies in the room (and I mean ALL of them).  They WILL find a way to sneak back into the picture and blast Samus from behind.  Such a dreadful gameplay flaw.Another enormous gameplay problem are the puzzles that require the gamer to deal with infinitely spawning enemies while trying to accomplish a task.  Many times, after spending more than 20 minutes trying to finish a task and being unable to do so thanks to the enemies being a frequent problem with their recurring ways,  I just shut the game off and say ""I'm done with this BS"".  I strongly dislike the way the puzzles are designed in this game.  I can't tell you how many times I was *almost* finished and an enemy became a distraction and I either couldn't finish the puzzle or died.  Frustration to the highest extent.The one positive is that Hypermode is pretty awesome.  No, it doesn't actually speed up the gameplay (like I originally thought when I first read about it).  Instead, Hypermode is the name of a really powerful laser beam-type weapon that blasts the living heck out of anything that moves.  It's pretty awesome.  However, there's a certain degree of complexity involved in using it properly that's a bit overbearing and therefore annoying.  It's only a slight learning curve admittedly because once you figure it out you'll be fine after that, so I can't complain about it TOO much. I can however, complain about something else- that being, when you immediately enter a room and become overwhelmed by enemies and therefore become corrupted right away, and you have ZERO time to react and therefore you die immediately.  Cheap, uncalled for, and severely flawed.The first three Metroid games ever made for the NES, Game Boy and Super NES were REALLY different from each other and that's another thing that made each of them appealing to gamers everywhere.  Alright, so the first two Metroid games aren't THAT much different (besides the obvious color and graphic differences) but certainly Super Metroid is a drastic step in a significantly different direction.The first three Metroid Prime games however, are all basically the same. It's *really* not like Nintendo to ever milk a series (with the exception of Mario perhaps) but for some reason, they're letting it happen with the Metroid Prime series. It's probably time they stopped working on making Metroid games and focused on another creation, because innovative gaming in the Metroid series is probably now a thing of the past.""",1,not worth your time no matter what anyone says,2007/11/23 0:00
A36UKFV79879MD,B000FQBPDU,BX Lounger,2,1,"Metroid Prime 3: Corruption was released on the Wii in 2007, about a year after the Wii console itself came out. This was a highly anticipated game because it was the last entry in the trilogy of the excellent Metroid Prime games, which started out on the Gamecube. And it delivers big time and shows that the Wii can foster great looking games with motion controls done in the right way. While The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess may have disappointed some gamers because it started out as a Gamecube title and only added motion controls for its debut launch on the Wii, MP3:C was developed from the ground up for the Wii.You once again take control of Samus as you explore new worlds and face old and new enemies. Like in the previous games, you fight your way to get a hold of new weapons to acquire and use against your enemies & get past areas that were previously not accessible. The visors also return and you use different them for different functions.So that part of the game hasn't changed much and anyone who has played the previous two games in the series will feel right at home. The major difference this time are the continuing story, the controls and the obvious benefits on being on a more powerful console.The PROS: Retro Studios made a huge name for themselves by showing they can take a popular Nintendo franchise and bring it to life as an adventure title disguised as a first person shooter with adventure elements. If there were any issues with Metroid Prime 1 and 2, this game eliminated them and balances everything out. The graphics are gorgeous, detailed and are top notch. The controls, including the gestures (they are kept to a minimum), are spot on and you can tweak the settings so it plays like one of your favorite FPSs. The music, sound effect and voice acting from the NPCs you encounter all fit right in and help immerse you into the planets you visit. You have a difficulty setting option so this game will challenge once you bump it up.The CONS: Well there isn't much to say here except that there is no online functionality with this game because it was released before Nintendo launched their Wi-Fi Connection service to play games online. Some people might be bummed that there is no multiplayer function but that's actually a good thing. There were multiplayer modes in Metroid Prime 2 but it did not play out so well and Metroid Prime Hunters,a multiplayer focused title, was released on the Nintendo DS to mixed fan reaction and reviews. Like I said before, some players may need to tweak the controls before playing the game to suit their way of playing. These are just minor gripes that don't derail the overall quality this game brings to the Wii.Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is an excellent game that should be in your collection and is a great way to end the Metroid Prime games. If you haven't picked this up yet, go get it. If you haven't played any of the Metroid Prime games, go get the Metroid Prime Trilogy instead. This collection has all 3 games with motion controls and optimized graphics added to the first two games. Either way, it is worth playing so don't miss out.",5,The Metroid Prime series ends with a bang!,2011/5/13 0:00
A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000FQBPDU,"Cloud ...""""",5,3,"At first, I wasn't a big fan of Samus' first 3D outing, Metroid Prime, on the Gamecube. It was fine but there wasn't a lot to suggest it can beat any other FPS games that I've played but upon second playing I grew to love it and consider it even better than the revered Super Metroid. However, Prime's sequel Echoes left me completely cold with its slightly alienating atmosphere, high difficulty and vague-for-the-sake-of-vague puzzles. Corruption, Samus' first foray on the Wii, doesn't really top the first Prime but it also corrects a lot that the others suffered from. It may not be the top Metroid title but it's certainly one of the most impressive.Story: Surprisingly, there's more depth to this one. Well as deep as a Metroid title can be I guess. Samus is called into action when several Aurora units, which are organic super computers, have been malfunctioning. Of course those pesky Space Pirates are to blame so Samus has to travel from planet to planet and restore the Aurora Units while dealing with an old foe as well as the substance known as Phazon which is having a curious effect on Samus.Graphics: The Wii has often been criticized for being the least advanced of the next-gen consoles as far as graphics are concerned. Well Metroid might not outdo Halo 3 or Assassin's Creed, it's definately one of the Wii's prettier titles. From more sharper textures and detail to the small things like fog and rain on your visor to particles, Metroid hasn't been given a overhaul but rather a nice upgrade visually. However, where the game slightly...and I mean slightly falters is in its artistic design since the guys at Retro Studios had environments that were quite simply beautiful or really great aesthetically. I mean Phendrana Drifts or Sanctuary Fortress had great architecture but aside from the oddball style of Bryyo, the planets here just look...simple. Skytown is basically just big pillars in the sky and Bryyo's fire section just looks...bland.Sound/Music: The music in Metroid has always been a bit more atmospheric and ambient rather than going for all-out orchestrated music in the epic sense a la Shadow of the Colossus. But now it's gotten a bit more action-oriented and makes the pace a little bit more pace while also supplying some fan-favorite remixes such as a Phendrana Drifts-type piece when you enter a snow area. Also new is voice acting and while dialogue-wise it's kinda cheesy, the voices aren't distracting although some might feel it takes away from the Samus against the elements"" vibe the series always had.Gameplay: When Resident Evil 4 was re-released onto the Wii, some felt the control scheme made the game more easier and took away from the challenge while others felt that it made the game more funner and enjoyable. Similar is the case with Corruption where it feels similar to a dual-analog setup where the nunchuk controls Samus' movements while the Wii-mote is used for aiming and turning. Some might have to get used to it since you have to have steady hands for some parts and lock-ons sometimes don't always lock-on but you quickly get used to it. Changing visors is always easy this time since you just press the - Button and a menu pops up; point to the visor you want and voila, you can scan or call on your ship among other things. Newly added thanks to Samus' exposure to Phazon is Hypermode where holding the + Button makes Samus go into overdrive and her firepower packs a wallop. It doesn't last long and takes away an energy tank but it's effective for killing monsters quicker.Like I mentioned, Samus has always been alone with the occasional meeting of a creature or trooper. Now instead of a more exploration-type setting where Samus travels across environments on her own, she can now traverse several, do missions, get out and on to the next own while meeting several Federation troopers and commanders. This gives it a more epic feel and a weird Halo feel so it's up to you whether you like this new approach. I'm sort of torn by it since the Prime series moreso than Fusion or Super Metroid really drove the idea home that it's just you against anything and everything the Space Pirates can launch at you and now it feels slightly...fractured with Samus able to jet off to a planet anytime she wants.Echoes drove me nuts since it seemed to think that fun meant replaying bosses over and over and a Dark World where you can die easily if you went away from safe areas. Either the aiming system made it better or the game's just easier by design but it's more accessible now. Of course it comes with a hard difficulty as well so if you think you could beat it, just pick the hard one instead. My one complaint is that bosses, while still fun and impressive, seem to suffer from that insane defense rating RPG bosses sometimes have where your attacks just don't seem to be powerful enough, making you fight for longer-than-usual times just to bring the guy down and the bosses are more exhausting than challenging since they just take awhile. However, with the ability to strafe and the accuracy of the Wii-mote, it's a bit more forgiveable.A lot of Nintendo systems tend to have a lot of average titles with a surprise now and then until the big guns arrive. Corruption is the same way: with most Wii games just using the controller in oddball, quirky ways, along come titles like Corruption and Mario Galaxy that show Nintendo can still deliver solid gameplay.""",5,One of the Wii's premier titles,2007/9/1 0:00

Now, finally, the Prime trilogy is completed with Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, which is undoubtedly the best FPS on the Wii, and one of the best overall game to hit the system yet.  Once again playing as intergalactic space heroine Samus Aran, you should feel right at home here the minute you fire up the game.  Even with a new control scheme that takes advantage of the Wii-mote and nunchuk controls, veterans of the series will have little to no trouble getting into the swing of things.  As you can expect, there are a fair share of inventive puzzles and great levels to explore, and the boss battles are nothing short of spectacularly memorable as well.  If there are any downsides to Metroid Prime 3, it's that the game can be too easy for some, and that as a whole, doesn't really do a whole lot more differently than the previous Metroid Prime games have done.

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000FQBPDU,S. Rhodes,9,8,"Ever since the Wii's launch, good games have been few and far between.  Certainly we got good games like The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess and we got a ton of mini-game compilations, but for the most part, the Wii has been getting mini-game compilations, ports with tacked on Wii controls, and games that were originally slated for the Gamecube.  Now we've finally got a high quality Wii game built from the ground up: Metroid Prime 3: Corruption.  Nintendo once again sets the bar.  Metroid Prime 3 is not only fun and easy to get into, but the controls are just an intuitive as ever.The game begins when Samus returns to Galatic Federation Station Olympus, a base of operations.  She's there to report for duty to Admiral Dane, as are other bounty hunters.  It appears the space pirates are up to no good as they've planted a virus in a series of the Galatic Units super computers, the Aurora Units.  Just as Admiral Dane is explaining how the bounty hunters must go and neutralize the virus, Olympus comes under attack.  It's time to suit up, escape Olympus station and get started on your mission.  Samus is not alone through her journey, as she has the help of other bounty hunters as well.  No, you won't get to play as any of them.You'll begin the game with a fairly basic arsenal.  Your power beam at your disposal, along with your morph ball and bombs for your morph ball.  As is usual for the Metroid formula, you'll get several upgrades along the way.  Including missiles, grapple beam, upgrades for your power beam and morph ball and a plethora of other upgrades.Playing the game itself is fairly simple with the Wii Remotes controls.  Using the joystick on the nunchuck you can go forward, backward, strife left and right.  Pressing the C Button goes into morph ball mode.  Pressing and holding Z locks you onto an enemy target.  Pressing A on the Wii Remote is how you'll fire your weapon, while pressing B makes you jump.  You can turn Samus by simply moving the cursor on screen via the Wii Remote left or right.  It's all pretty basic and all pretty simple.  The 1 button pulls up your map while the 2 button will supply you with hints to your objective.  These controls are pretty tight and simple to learn.  The game will also help you out every step of the way by providing hints to help you out.  It can sometimes feel like the game is holding your hand, but if you really want to go at things on your own, you can turn the hints off.  If at any time you have trouble with the controls, you're able to change them.  You can also change the sensitivity of the Wii Remote.How the game uses motion sensors, however, is where it gets innovative.  Throughout the game you'll have to pull switches or press in switches.  While Samus will interact with some things on her own accord, there are plenty of moments when you'll have to do it.  For example, at the very beginning of the game, you'll have to control Samus's hand movements with the Wii remote and make her press buttons.  Later you'll have to pull switches by pulling the Wii Remote back, and then turning the same switch clockwise (or counterclockwise)  and then pushing it back in.Even more engaging is using the grapple beam.  To use the grapple beam you'll have to flail the nunchuck forward and then pull back to flail whatever it is your targeting.  You can only target specific things, however, and usually the game will provide you with an icon to let you know.  This is also essential to the gameplay as you'll also encounter enemies who use shields and you'll have to use your grapple beam to take them away before you can damage them.A lot of your weapons and accessories will receive upgrades as you go through the game.  New to Metroid Prime, however, is hypermode.  Soon in your adventure you'll get the Phazon Enhancement Device (called a PED).  This will allow you to enter hypermode.  While in hypermode your attacks become more devastating.  You can't stay in hypermode forever, though, and while it's a great asset to you, it'll cost you one full energy tank to transform, so you'll have to watch your health.As with previous entries in the series, though, Metroid Prime 3 wants you to scan things.  Switching to the scanning visor is easier than ever here.  Just press and hold the minus button and you'll be able to switch to the scan visor easily and scan your targets using the Z button.  Like previous Metroid Prime games it plays a part in completion.  Here it isn't just for completion, but also to access unlockables.  Throughout the game you're awarded credits.  Red credits, blue credits and gold credits.  Most of these credits (such as the red and blue) will be earned through scanning.  Red credit are obtained when you scan new creatures, blue when you scan new lore and gold is awarded when you meet special conditions such as defeating a boss.  You can also obtain credits in others ways, such as saving allies in distress.  The game also presents friend vouchers to you, and these are also acquired through meeting special conditions as well as getting lots of kills throughout the mission.  Friend Vouchers are useless on their own, but send them off to friends and they'll instantly become friend credits for them.  If you want friend credits, have a friend send you friend vouchers.The credits will grant you access to some of the games galleries, like the concept gallery, the bonus gallery and the soundtrack gallery.  There are tons of extras and a ton of scanning to be done to get them.Another aspect that Metroid hasn't changed.  Throughout the game there are missile expansions and energy tanks for you to collect and the game keeps track of all your pickups.  For completists this is perfect.  As you don't have to get all, but getting to some of them can be a challenge.  This is what is so nice about Metroid, it encourages exploration.  However, you won't find yourself lost ever.  The game is very good about telling you what to do next and where to go, and the in game map is also detailed about it and puts your objective there.  So even if you decide to explore, getting back on the main path is no hassle. One crucial thing the Metroid Prime series has suffered through, however, is how they use their save rooms.  They're too few and far between and Metroid Prime 3 is no exception.  It's a pain to complete an objective, but be too far from a save room and then die because of a surprise attack from a group of enemies.The games boss battles are monumental, though.  Each boss battle is a memorable one and makes the gameplay intense.  Mostly because many bosses you have to meet certain conditions before you can actually damage them.  This adds a bit of strategy to many of the battles.The environments here are beautiful looking, at least, and huge.  Absolutely fantastic.  In terms of showing us what the Wii can do, this is a good start.  By far it's the most beautiful looking game on the system to date.  The environments are detailed as are your enemies who will hunt you down.  The game also doesn't suffer from any framerate issues or long load times. The game also sounds breathtaking.  Almost every part of the sound is a winner.  The sound effects are perfect, and the background music is brilliant.  Some tunes are remixed from previous Metroid titles (notably Super Metroid), while all the new stuff is just as good.  The voice acting is also brilliant.Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is a brilliant game.  Well worth the wait.  The amount of time put into the game shows.  Hopefully we'll see more games like it in the future, and ones that make as good of use out of the Wii Remote as this one did.Pros:+Gorgeous graphics+Fantastic soundtrack+Good voice acting+Tight intuitive controls+Intense boss battles+Lots of bonus content+Huge maps to exploreCons:-Save rooms are too few and far between",5,The Perfect Game for the Wii,2007/8/28 0:00

In the case of Gears of War, one of the big premier blockbusters for the Xbox 360, it's one of those cases where, indeed there is some entertainment to be had and it's the perfect game when you want to just kill stuff without having to go online to deal with annoying brats. But then again, this game does have its flaws and they're pretty easy to spot but since it's Gears, people go ""meh, no big deal"" whereas most games get called out and criticized heavily. All this being said, Gears of War is still a fun game but one that can get maddeningly frustrating while it delivers balls-to-the-wall entertainment.Story: On the planet Sera, the inhabitants have been terrorized by an alien race known as the Locust Horde who suddenly popped out of the ground on Emergence Day (""E-Day"") and are gradually reducing the number of the survivors. While fighting through a prison, Dom Santiago rescues his friend and your main guy, Marcus Fenix, and it's up to you to make it through dangerous cities and areas to hopefully nail a crippling blow to the Locust Horde.Yep, that's it. That's the story and I'm not trying to be mean here since there's not much plot here and what plot there is tends to be skipped over or not given as much depth. Fans who have played 2 will note 2 references to Maria and yet even that plot wasn't given as much attention despite Epic saying it's more ""epic and personal"". There's one line about the ""sham"" of a trial that Marcus had, well what kind of sham? Still don't know. As far as the game's story is concerned, I wasn't a big fan of the pacing. While indeed it's fairly short at 8-10 hours give or take the difficulty and skill, the pieces never really felt connected and there was some really slow parts. Not an in-depth story by any stretch but likable enough to push through.Graphics: This is really a cosmetic nitpick than anything but I never liked the blood in games that uses the Unreal Engine like Uncharted since it was seemed more mass-like and gooey than a liquid but in a game like this, it seems to go hand-in-hand. But one can't deny the graphical power of the engine and from the extremely detailed character animation, scale of the firefights and architecture make this a showcase for what the 360 can bring to the table. Really small nags are the famous Unreal Engine texture problems, occasional pauses, slight framerate things but they're usually never an issue or distracting enough to cause frustration. One thing though is despite how stunning it looks, it's very drab looking with a lot of mild colors and desaturated colors but that's sort of a Gears look I guess.Sound/Music: The movie 300 was something that I tried several times to get into but I never could and one theory was that it was basically a movie for the frat boys who'll cheer at the violent parts and revel in the weird use of heavy metal music yet it has quote-unquote ""depth"" that made it different than most action movies. Not. Gears of War on the other hand knows it's basically a dumb summer blockbuster movie and just rolls with it from the line readings and one-liner dialogue. It's not meant to elicit tears but it's not eye-rolling either. The music however is fantastic from the creeping sound design to the big bombastic moments during firefights, this is one to have a stereo on.Gameplay: Whereas shooters like Call of Duty or Halo are all about strafing a little bit from a wall or cover just enough to nail the enemy, Gears of War is all about taking cover. From columns to big blocks of stone, doorways, ruined cars etc, just press A and your character slams his side and is able to avoid enemy fire. Pressing the LT lets you take aim and RT to fire or pressing RT is just covering fire, inaccurate but helpful for nailing charging Locusts without wanting to pop up. Carrying up to 4 weapons at a time, we have the Hammer of Dawn, a laser-targeting system where a satellite will beam huge rays onto the area and all but vaporizing the enemy to standard pistols and shotgun. The highlight of course is the Lancer, which is basically a normal assault rifle only it has a chainsaw for a bayonet. Just hold the B, get closer to an enemy and zzzzzz!, you saw them in half. Only problem is that getting shot stops the revving and it's really frustrating to try to chainsaw someone only to get shot and have it stop.The big problem with the game is the AI and not the enemies who'll flank, throw grenades and do whatever it takes till you're lifeless on the ground. The AI problems come from your teammates since they are, to borrow a Yahtzee phrase, ""pants-on-head retarded"". They'll openly go out of cover for seemingly no apparent reason other than wanting to get closer and they'll end up crying for help to be revived which you do by pressing X near the body. It happens with such frequency that I even saved one guy only to literally need help 4 seconds later when he got out of cover instead of just staying put. While co-op in most games is more fun, here it's more beneficial you go through it co-op since the players will be smarter than the game itself. You can issue squad commands like attack, cease fire and regroup but more often that not it's like ""I can't do that right now"". Hope you like to babysit.Another issue is that the A button becomes a multi-use button from slipping in and out of cover, doing a ""roadie run"", swat turns and rolling out of the way and many times I'd try to get away only to take cover and it's like ""no, I want you to roll"".  Oh and there is some incredibly trying moments in the difficulty where Hardcore is fairly hard at times thanks to the AI of your squad but also it's very frustrating to all of a sudden be shot by a rocket launching bugger or the Torque Bow users when you're trying to do something else. One time I was in a battle and enemies literally spawned right behind me and I had no idea they were even there. Strangely they fixed this in the sequel where it was more easier yet more funner so least that's an improvement.As far as the multiplayer is concerned, you gotta admire Epic releasing so many maps, especially for 2 (they're up to 29 now) but it's slightly disappointing. During ""join a quick match"", after 3 refreshes it literally cycled between the same 2 matches almost as if out of the, I'm sure thousands, that still play this online, there's only 2 matches that even pop up. Plus the match itself is a race, who can find the sniper first, who got the boomshot first and for the most part it's not like Killzone or Call of Duty where at least you have balancing between shotguns, RPG's etc but here it's like ""I have a grenade launcher and you don't"" which usually means an easier win for them. Despite the matchmaking and lag of the sequel, I found it a way funner multiplayer and this one is probably one of the few I'd consider boosting then leaving it alone.Is it game of the year? No, well at least not to me but considering the huge release and fanfare the game got, it sure seems like it. But it's like a lot of movies out there that get exceedingly popular for no reason other than it's fun yet it's got a couple of issues.""",5,A few bullets short of perfect,2008/11/19 0:00

You are a muscular, well trained soldier wearing pounds of gear, armor and weapons - and it'll barely be enough to keep you alive.This game is compared frequently to Halo, but if Halo is the lighthearted ease of Star Wars, Gears of War is the non-stop assault and clinging to life of Alien. You're not jumping around like a kangaroo here, blasting at foes. You are heavily laden, crouching behind anything you can find to shield you, trying your best to stay alive for five more minutes. You have to work strategically with your fellow soldiers to climb forward every inch.The graphics in Gears of War are very impressive. The game is done in a palatte of browns, greys and reds. The dismal skies above, the swarms of black birds, the dented and dingy equipment - this is a world on the verge of despair. Enemies don't stand out with brightly colored costumes. You have to really pay attention to know where they are and to take them out.The sounds really help drive home the urgency of your mission. Voices cry out on all sides for help. The hammering of the machine guns and rapid fire weapons ring in your ears. The soundtrack is pounding and epic. If anything this is all TOO pounding - after playing this for weeks, I really can get a headache :) I'd turn it down, but then I wouldn't be able to tell where the enemies were sniping me from sometimes.The storyline really helps involve you in what is going on. It's like being at the center of a high power action movie. There are decisions you can make along the way to help guide the story. I really enjoy the fight for every inch of soil"" way it has you feel like you are involved in a real challenge. It might seem TOO challenging for some new gamers. Stick with it - it's well worth it.I do wish, with all of their emphasis on taking cover and being cautious - that you could CROUCH. I understand not being able to jump - you're wearing hundreds of pounds of gear! However, you can crouch behind cover. Why can't you crouch when you're not near cover, to lower your profile a bit?

A1ZPVW0WXNJ3YZ,B000FRU0NU,"Alex 47""""",0,0,"I made this a few days after release. [...]Here's my review on what is one of, if not the, biggest game and what some say the most overrated game, of all-time. I've only played it for about 6 hours, so I will probably be editing this review. This is my first impression. ( Note: I didn't play the beta. )Graphics: 4.5/5 Look quite good, but don't really blow you away. The character models for the most part look phenomenal, and the environments do as well. Still, it's not the most impressive looking game out there right now. Hell, to all the whiners, I'd rather have an okay looking game that runs smoothly than a fantastic looking game that lags a lot.Sound: 5/5 Top notch. The talking throughout your men in campaign is really well done. The voice acting in the cut scenes are also great. You will likely never hear the same thing twice in battle. The explosions and guns still sound fantastic too. Everything Halo 2 sounded like, but better.Control: 4.5/5 Not quite perfect. In my opinion, Halo 2 had better controls for a 360 controller. Still, Halo 3 doesn't control bad, but it does take some getting used to. Such as you having to learn how to use the RB button to get in vehicles and pick up guns and what-not, as well as reload, instead of using the X button used in Halo 2. Still controls very well though.Fun: 5/5 I must say, this game left a great first impression. I started with Campaign first, and was less than surprised at the start, mainly because the game kept on lagging. But once the game started going, the Campaign got pretty fun. And, in case you don't already know, you can have four person co-op, which makes Legendary quite a bit easier to play through. ( Still not a sinch in any stretch of the imagination though. ) I could review this game all day. The single player, co-op, Forge, multiplayer, all the maps, how the guns hold up, the AI, the ability to record your games, and what not. All I really need to say though, is it's worth it. There aren't many maps currently available to play on Halo 3, but just about all of them are a lot of fun. If you don't think they are at first, go ahead and play them a few times. The game looks good, controls great, and sounds fantastic. Almost everything about this game that I've seen so far is top notch.5/5",4,This is an OLD REVIEW.,2009/8/22 0:00
A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000FRU0NU,"Cloud ...""""",0,0,"On one hand, it's quite easy to criticize a series like Halo"". It's a simple first-person shooter, control vehicles, grenades and big set-pieces are pretty standard in a lot of FPS' lately and it doesn't really do anything revolutionary to make it the ""shooter to end all shooters"". However, the mythos, characters and the sheer fun of the series as a whole is quite enticing and out of the shooter franchises involving aliens which include ""Resistance"" and ""Gears of War"", Halo probably has my favorite mythology tied to it. When the second game ended, it came with a slightly confusing storyline and a cliffhanger that didn't feel finished, like watching a tv show when the power goes out. Bungie took many of the criticisms found with both games and addressed them for this installment. Does it make it a better game?Story: When Halo 2 ended, Cortana had been captured by the Gravemind, the Prophet of Truth was heading to Earth to activate the Ark which would fire all Halo installations in the galaxy, effecting wiping every living being off the face of the universe. So in comes Master Chief and with the help of the Arbiter and the marines, the whole future of the galaxy rests on everyone's favorite Spartan.Graphics: Barring the repetitive level design from the first game, it was still a great looking game for its time, same with 2. The third game while given a major upgrade, might not have the flashy effects that are found in games like Gears, Bioshock or Call of Duty IV. However, the detailing, environments and the big battles are still here in all their chaoticness and seeing a Scarab destroyed a mere 40 feet from you is really awesome. Character animations are slightly iffy and because you can't install directly to the hard drive, you'll occasionally see some stutters and pauses though they're forgivable.Sound/Music: With that main theme, how can you not get pumped? Sweeping and very theatrical, the score is easily a highlight of the game and when the music kicks before a big battle, it's easy to get that sense of excitement and be jazzed up for the fight. Voice acting as always is excellent and despite the fact your teammates are inconsistent in their help, their lines are quite funny at times. Only thing I wish would've been addressed is the option to change the sound volume. I play with headphones (the earphone doesn't work) and when you're on co-op or multiplayer, would've been nice to turn the game sound low so you can hear Live chatter.Gameplay: Nothing much that's been changed from the 2nd game. Dual-wielding, vehicle boarding and the like is still the same though with it comes new additions. Added is the Mongoose, a sort of ATV with optional gunner in the back, and the favorite Chopper which is slightly harder to drive than a Ghost or Warthog for me but with spinning blades in front and cannons, it's easy to mow down enemies. Air units in the campaign are really only relagated to one part though there's a couple of parts where you can ride a Scorpion but Banshees on the ground are strangely absent unless you shoot one from the sky.One thing that I love the addition of is co-op for the campaign since as most can tell you, Legendary achievement can be a ***** and having up to 3 additional friends to help you out not only cancels out the weak friendly AI but speeds up the process since it isn't as wall-making every 10 minutes. Also you can find skulls within the game which will add special effects to the game. Some are just goofy like headshots on grunts will cause confetti to be thrown into the air complete with a ""hurray!"" soundbit while others will give enemies more grenade tossing capabilities or even have weapons have less ammo when picked up with the benefit being they add multipliers for a level score. Getting the achievements will require you to add more than one and it adds a nice arcade-y feel.What's made Halo 3 so popular since it came out is its multiplier and got to give it to Bungie for their commitment to the thing. 3 map packs plus a free redesigned one, title updates and countless players online, it makes for a bit of an addictive play. My only gripe is that like most MP games, you have to vote on a map and should the majority wins you get another map/game type automatically. However it's not like say Call of Duty IV where you're specifically in Capture the Flag or King of the Hill and the changes are the maps, you can be in one gametype, map gets vetoed and thrown into an entirely different map and game type. Plus let's face it: you've never seen as much snotty brats, arrogant punks and racist slurs as you can with the community in Halo 3. In fact, I think I heard the racist slur ***got near 20+ times in one match so be prepared to mute.With a near endless supply of players, looooong list of achievements and a fun campaign, Halo 3 has enough value for 60 bucks. Just depends on whether or not you can see past the hype and all that other stuff.""",4,One of world's biggest but world's best?,2009/1/14 0:00

AN81JUYW2SL24,B000FRU0NU,Gearhead Mania,4,3,"Halo 3As someone that played Halo, Halo 2, and Halo Reach, I felt it was obvious that I needed to try Halo 3 and Halo 3 ODST. Since Halo 3 was released years ago, there's not much more new info I can say on the game. The single-player campaign story made no sense to me. Doing further research, the story begins where the comic book ends. I felt it would have been better to make the game Halo 3 pick up right after where the game Halo 2 concluded, not every gamer will follow the comics or novels. Speaking of the single player campaign, the transitions between missions were poorly done. It's as if someone just skipped several cutscenes and throws you into something new. Keyes's death made no sense either, she could have gone in with more support and perhaps some body armor.The interruptions from Cortana and Gravemind were a big nuisance throughout the game. The vehicle controls are still pretty much the same as they were in Halo (and Halo Reach) which I feel are very outdated. The physics don't feel right, and it would have made sense to use controls similar to that of other Xbox driving games.The game also takes eons to load the campaign if you decide to play another game other than Halo 3 because it flushes the cache. The Halo ring"" takes several minutes to load when it does this. If you shut off the Xbox after playing Halo 3, and return to play Halo 3 (and not another game/demo), the ""ring"" loads super fast. They need to work on this in the future because I recall some issues with Halo Reach, although not as frequent.Not much more can be said about Halo 3. The only things I'd recommend for Halo 4 are faster load times, more modern physics/controls for the vehicles (perhaps a helmet view or cockpit view ala Forza), and a better single player campaign.I started playing Halo 3: ODST and noticed many differences from Halo 3, namely that the achievements are more similar to Halo Reach which is a good thing. They are more oriented towards single player mode which makes it more fun. The VISR mode in ODST is similar to the night vision mode in Halo Reach. All in all, I'd say that while Halo 3 was ok, I felt Halo 3 ODST and Halo Reach were better.Overall: 3/5 stars""",3,"Great game for its time, not as good as Reach IMHO",2011/10/25 0:00

No matter how well it did, people are going to judge its wow factor"" against how amazing the original Halo felt to play back when it first came out. Now that we are used to the weapons, races, environments and plotline, nothing is as cool as it was that first time. It's the same issue that plagues any series, be it Dune, the Matrix, Star Wars, etc.Halo 3 does get a boost in that it is released for the 360, so you get an automatic upgrade in abilities there. We're playing on a high end HD TV, and yes, it looks really nice. The backgrounds look like a painting in motion, with swirling clouds and dancing dust storms. From the light glinting off the metal surfaces to the detailed shadows in the rocks, it can be really gorgeous. Is every detail as beautiful as every detail in, say Gears of War? Maybe not. Different developers focus on different items.  There are always trade-offs for speed and visual appeal reasons. For a Halo world, I think they did a good job.The sound and dialogue are really great. I like the background music, and I find much of the dialogue hilarious. There are some conversations that have me laughing out loud. This is a good game to play with your surround sound stereo system hooked up, and of course the subwoofers.I hated the ending of Halo 2. I dislike it when a story finishes with a ""and now wait a few years to find out what happened.""  They can at least have you feel like you achieved something, and ended a chapter. For that reason alone it's good to have Halo 3 here to wrap everything up.Unfortunately, with all the time they spent in development, this third outing is a bit predictable. I really enjoyed the multi character play in Halo 2. I thought that was a great touch. They completely removed it for Halo 3, setting you back into a Master Chief only mode. To be honest, I really thought we'd get THREE races this time around, and get to play as the Flood too. Why reduce ourselves to just one?Also, while there are a lot of ""missions"", some of them are maybe 5 minutes long. That's a bit on the short side. I realize you can go back and replay on harder and harder levels to challenge yourself - but they could have put more depth into the basic story line.Now, all of those things being said, the key to any game in modern times is its multiplayer ability. No matter what single player game you play, it's pretty much a limited time game. Multiplayer is completely unlimited - and you're not stuck with the formulas built into the AI brains. Halo 3 is definitely the best multiplayer experience of the three games - the most balanced, the most fun, the best graphics. You could literally play this for years and not get bored of it.So to summarize - if you don't have XBox Live, you could rent this game for a week, get through it and have a lot of fun. You'll be able to see how the story ends, get your Halo fix in and be happy. But if you do have XBox Live, you'll want to own this. Between replaying the base game on harder levels to improve your skills, and playing multi-player in a variety of maps and set-ups, you'll be happy for a long, long while.There are many games we write a walkthrough for that we have to push ourselves to get through, but when we did our walkthrough for Halo 3, we really did have fun :) So that's always a good sign!""",5,A Must-Own - But Not Perfection,2007/9/30 0:00

Thanks to Bungie, the game has been more than worth the wait, and the end result is undoubtedly the best first person shooter to hit the Xbox 360 yet, and maybe ever.  Picking up after the cliffhanger ending of Halo 2, Master Chief is in pursuit of the Covenant, who is hell bent and heading to Earth.  You'll be happy to know first and foremost that Halo 3 improves on everything that has been seen in the previous two installments of the series, from the game's epic story to the overall gameplay mechanics.  The story provides enough closure and answers many of the questions raised in Halo 2, and nicely ties things up while leaving enough room open if there ever are any more installments in the series.  As for the gameplay, which is the reason enough to pick the game up even of the story were a disappointment, is everything you could hope for and more so besides.  The single player campaign is lengthy enough to satisfy jaded gamers angry at the incredibly short length of Halo 2, but what even makes it more enjoyable is the four-player co-op mode, which can even be taken over Xbox Live.  And yes, speaking of Xbox Live, the multiplayer options is where the real meat and potatoes of Halo 3 is to be had, but you already knew that.  Besides the standard deathmatch modes, there are some new options, most notably Infection, which involves zombies trying to convert you.  New map modes and options really let the player let loose with creativity as well, and result in an incredible amount of replay value that an FPS hasn't seen in quite some time.  There are new weapons, brilliant graphics, solid voice acting, and the game isn't hard at all for new gamers to the series to pick up either.  Yes, Halo 3 is finally here, and it's quite simply the best FPS to hit the Xbox 360 yet.

The story doesn't really pick up until about half way though so just be patient. The graphics are awesome. I don't care if you think it's Halo 2 HD they are REALLY good. Full HDR lighting and high-resolution textures with bump mapping. The audio is great and everything you love about Halo is here. There is all the old stuff here plus a lot of new stuff. Tons actually. First are two best features...Forge and Theater.While theater lets you record 16 seconds of you playing it doesn't work like you think. You choose your map and you press go and it records and your done. You can save screenshots and upload which is still cool, and Forge is well...a map editor. There are also new weapons such as the gravity hammer, a Spiker which is like the Needler but spikes instead, there are new vehicles new everything.I mainly hated most was the friendly AI. It's so retarded its nuts! While someone's driving and your shooting you have to constantly do both at the same time. There will be two Wraiths on your ass and you're trying to get a bead while your stupid friendly is trying to drive up a mountain side. It gets so irritating sometimes.What I mostly liked about Halo 3 is the campaign is more varied. Not one place is repeated twice. The gameplay is always mixed up as well between, indoor, outdoor, and vehicular combat. The indoor combat sucks though because it's too cramped and it's easy to get killed. The outdoor battles are what's awesome. The places are HUGE with giant Scarabs you have to kill while tons of people are fighting around you. That's basically it really. It has a great achievement system and it isn't extremely difficult to unlock them all.

It's almost to the point where you can't just say the game is good. You either love it or hate it. I don't love Halo, but I don't hate it either. For what it's worth it's a pretty good game. Obviously if you didn't think much of the first two games, however, it's unrealistic to expect you'll think highly of the third one. Simply put, if you don't like Halo, don't expect the third game in the series to turn you into a fan.The story is told through cutscenes that are well acted with their voice talents. If you've been interested in the story since the beginning, chances are you'll like it and be satisfied. The game doesn't drown you out in story sequences either. For those who just want to get to the gameplay, you've got it. But there is a fair amount of story here as well.In terms of gameplay, however, Halo 3 doesn't really do much to distinguish itself from Halo 2. Most (if not all) the mechanics to the gameplay are pretty much the same. There are some new weapons thrown in there, but for the most part, a lot of your arsenal comes from the first two games. There's very little that separates the third installment from the first two. This can either be a good or a bad thing. Good because you'll instantly be able to familiarize yourself with the game. It's like seeing an old friend again. Yet because of this, the game is no challenge at all for the veteran Halo gamer. Likewise, those expecting Halo 3 to go above and beyond will find it doesn't. Whether or not the game being too much like Halo 2 is a problem or not is up to the individual gamer.In addition to that, the campaign is quite short. Most likely you'll be able to finish it in one or two days without fail. To compensate, however, the game does have different difficulty levels and there are plenty of achievements to get. There are also skulls hidden in some of the missions which can alter gameplay and make the game a bit more difficult. So it may be short, but there is replay for anyone who wants to master the game. There's also co-op with up to four players. You can actually do co-op with some friends online.Halo has always been well known for its multi-player. Particularly online. Again, like Halo 2, it doesn't do a whole lot of things differently. There are a couple of new modes, but much like the gameplay, there's just not enough new here. However, there is a Forge system that allows you to customize maps by placing things like weapons and such in different places. You can even share these creations with your friends online.  Multiplayer isn't everything its cracked up to be, though.  While it can be fun, it only really takes off if you decide to get on XBOX Live or System Link with a bunch of friends.  Offline it's only you vs. your friends and even when it's four of you it's rather unexciting in some of these maps.  You can't set up AI competitors either.  So unless you go online Multiplayer can feel quite empty.The game looks good. By far one of the prettier games on the console. There certainly are better looking games on the 360, but this one is still a nice piece of eye candy. It runs smoothly as well at a steady framerate. There are a couple of moments of clipping but it's not enough to hinder gameplay and some will not notice these things. The game's soundtrack is also a good one. Many tunes are repeated from the previous games, but what's new is also good.Halo 3 is a good game overall. If you were impressed with the first two games, you'll probably be impressed here. It doesn't do enough to distinguish itself from the previous games but it's still a good game overall. As I noted before, if you didn't like Halo before, do not expect the third game to make a fan out of you.Pros:+Familiar gameplay+A lot of online multiplayer modes+Good graphics and music+Emphasis on gameplay and story+You can customize maps+There's some replay value hereCons:-The campaign mode is quite short-In terms of gameplay and multiplayer the game does not do a lot to distinguish itself from the previous games and there isn't enough new stuff thrown in either",4,The Fight is Done,2007/9/26 0:00

A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B000FRU0NU,Winter,0,0,"If you've played a variety of FPS games, there are times when it seems the Master Chief has weights on his feet compared to the speed of, say, Gordon Freeman or Soap MacTavish.  That said, of the first three entries in the Halo series, Halo 3 really feels like the first time we get to fully stretch our wings.  The first game introduced us to a two-weapon mechanic that really requires you to think strategically.  The second expanded on that with dual-wield and a little bit of physics effects in-game.  But Halo 3 really brings all those things together in a way that shines.In Halo 3, you play The Master Chief"", a cyborg soldier who is the last of his kind, and an inspiration to all of humanity.  Having done great deeds in the first two installations, The Master Chief is now the single greatest soldier in an interstellar war of epic proportions.  Your health is measured by a shield that protects you from damage:  if you take too many hits in a row, you need to get to cover and let your shield recharge.  As you play through levels, you often balance keeping an eye on your ammo with watching how much your shield has been hit.  The added dimension is tactics:  which enemies are in the area should greatly affect which weapons you choose to pick up...and how to deploy them.  For example, if you dual-wield two weapons, sometimes you want two of the exact same weapons so that you can dump huge amounts of rounds into a strong foe.  Other times you want to have two different kinds:  an energy weapon to sap the enemy's shields and a projectile weapon to do serious amounts of damage once he is vulnerable.  One other nice addition is the ability to pick up particular items that assist you, from a shield bubble that protects you to a bright flare that blinds your enemies, and more.  What makes it a challenge is that they can use the same things you do!While previous Halo games added a variety of enemies, you really start to see their capabilities take off in Halo 3.  A brute can charge at you, or can simply knock heavy objects around, causing complete chaos.  There are times when the battlefield gets so dramatically changed by what's going on that you really need to keep your head about you to avoid getting pinned down, or stumbling over an obstacle that wasn't there before.  Enemies are also much better at getting to cover, timing their shots, and being willing to climb on top of or over obstacles to get at you.  The AI has a ""fight-or-flight"" mentality to them, but there are times when they can goad each other out of fleeing and into turning around and coming back at you.  Probably the most fun I had was realizing my enemies could now flank me, and wouldn't hesitate to do so without yelling out exactly what they were going to do.  While you do get aided by your fellow marines (and an unlikely alien ally), it's clear that the bad guys are all focusing on taking you out.  They know exactly who you are, and each of them sees you as the greatest threat to their war.If you're new to the Halo series, this is a good starting point.  While it can be a bit more complicated than the first two entries, the easy difficulty is well balanced for you.  Experienced players will enjoy Heroic difficulty, and Legendary is definitely for the practiced of hand.  Multiplayer gets an added dimension in that many of the single-player maps are designed for a multiplayer experience as well:  so familiar territory for those who begin with the single-player campaign.  The fact that multiplayer means everyone else can make the same weapon choices you do means that there is a lot more variety and creativity (and thus a lot more difficulty) facing human foes.  This is one of my favorite games for the XBox 360, and my only lament is that it was never made for the PC.""",5,Worlds of Fun,2011/11/3 0:00

Only this time, the story follows Link as he journeys to save his friend Tetra from Bellum, with the help of Captain Linebeck and his ship, the S.S. Linebeck.In my opinion, it's a Zelda game that's worthy of the name. I enjoyed it a great deal. Given, it took a little while to get used to the control scheme. Once you play it that way awhile,it starts to feel natural, really. I don't see why that's such a sore point with people who've played the game. If I had any major gripes with the game, it would be the short dungeon levels, the time spent going through them and the timer in the Temple of the Ocean King.  Other than that, Phantom Hourglass is as near perfect a Zelda game that it can be.What I loved most about the game is the fact that it's a direct sequel to Legend of Zelda:The Wind Waker.

But when you have the if it ain't broke..."" adage fitting perfectly, one can understand Nintendo's reluctance to completely overhaul the series. With Phantom Hourglass, it's kind of like Minish Cap-style presentation with some of the more unique controls found in Twilight Princess. Does it make it a great game? Well it certainly does have the classic gameplay but it might not have the classic status of Ocarina of Time or even an underrated one like the Oracle series.Story: Taking place a couple months after Wind Waker, Link is onboard the pirate ship with Tetra when they come across a mysterious ghost ship. Mind on treasure, Tetra goes onboard only to disappear and Link thrown overboard. He arrives on an island and with the help of a ship captain, Linebeck and a fairy named Ciela, Link searches for the ship to save his friend.Graphics: Some might find it similar to Final Fantasy III's DS remake but that doesn't mean the graphics are bad. In fact, this is probably some of the most detailed and lively graphics on the DS. It really does have that kind of ""miniature Gamecube"" feel in some of the scenes.Sound/Music: Zelda at times had the best music when it stuck to the familiar themes. Not saying the music's bad here, of course not, but there's times where you like the music playing but there really isn't that distinctive theme until you go ""hey wait, is that a remixed version of Zelda's Lullaby?"" But maybe it's just me.Gameplay: Last time it was changing into a wolf, now, um, well there is the titular hourglass. Beating bosses fills up the hourglass a bit which allows more time to complete the dungeon of the Ocean King. Getting more items allows further access into the dungeon. It's a nice idea but it would nice if we didn't feel like going through the floors again in order to get to the next section. There is a halfway point but it would be nice if you can ""zap"" to the next section.Along with Twilight Princess, this is probably one of the most different in terms of controlling Link. Done entirely (let me repeat, ENTIRELY, no control pad here) with the stylus, Link at times even controls better. Instead of locking in, you just tap the enemy and Link lunges with his sword; do a swipe and he'll horizontal slash or draw a circle around Link and he'll spin dash. Even using items like boomerangs and bombs are funner to use thanks to user-controlled flight paths for the former or precise throwing for the latter.It's moving Link around the field that feels unpolished. Have the stylus farther away from Link and he runs, closer and he's slower or draw circles on the outside of the screen and he'll roll. There are times where you fall off cliffs because you pushed too far away, causing a sprint rather than a walk and rolls can be a pain to pull off. There was also a couple times where you have bomb flowers and pointing to them has Link pick them and instead you sword swipe them, causing them to explode in your face.The sailing's more easier now. You just draw a path on your map and take a breather while firing a cannon now and then at enemies. However, it's this streamlining that might bug players who don't like the decrease in difficulty. Gone are the days of Link to the Past and the Oracle series where you can get easily stomped if you're not careful, Minish and Hourglass have a more accessible difficulty where you're not cursing the game because of one frustrating dungeon - Water Temple, anyone? - but still, the game depends on your skill as a Zelda gamer. Newbies can easily grasp it eventually while veterans might find the lack of difficulty disturbing. (heh heh, Star Wars reference).If you've beaten Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass will easily tide you over. It's fun, not challenging and probably not the best Zelda recently but it's Zelda and that means enjoyable gameplay.""",5,A welcome debut on the DS,2007/10/5 0:00

He wakes up on an island after found by the inhabitants, and immediately sets out to find the phantom ship and save Tetra. The story has some memorable new characters in it, such as the fairy Ciela (who serves mainly as your cursor) and the cowardly but boastful ship's captain, Linebeck.The gameplay on this system is dependent entirely on the touch screen and, occasionally, the microphone. The directional pad and buttons have no effect whatsoever; everything from running (tap or hold where you want to go) to fighting (slash the stylus in the direction you want to go) to using items is done with the stylus. This undoes one of the main problems of the stylus in other games, namely switching from using buttons to using the touch screen. The microphone also comes into play at some points - either by blowing on it to put out a candle or by yelling into it to call out to someone on the other side of a door.Like Wind Waker, Phantom Hourglass involves sea exploration, but since the new ship in this is a paddle ship (as opposed to the sailing ship from Wind Waker) all that is required is to draw a line on your sea chart to your destination. Speaking of maps, it is possible to write down notes on your map (normally relegated to the top screen, but can be ""pulled"" down to the touch screen); this is necessary in some points to get through areas by copying down safe routes through a trap-laden area or to mark where a particular treasure is. The options are diverse but simple, and an average player should be able to get the hang of the system pretty quickly. The only problem I had with control was that rolling (by making small circles on the edge of your screen) was difficult and got confused with regular movement.The graphics are a pretty good rendering of Wind Waker's graphical style, with only a slight decrease in smoothness to accommodate the DS's graphical limitations. The cel-shaded style remains intact and it is a pretty good job overall. The sound is about the same as it was in Wind Waker, with limited voice acting (Link's cries, specifically).As a whole, this game is a good sequel to Wind Waker. I admit that I was wary of the stylus' potential after playing previous DS games with clunkier interfaces, but the gameplay is both smooth and innovative. As a whole, it's a remarkably good product.9/10.""",5,"Smooth, Innovative Gameplay",2008/2/15 0:00

Phantom Hourglass picks up right where Wind Waker left off, with Link and Tetra (Zelda) sailing the seas.  Naturally, things don't go quite well as a ghost ship appears, Tetra takes off, and Link is washed ashore on an island.  Despite the familiar storyline, Phantom Hourglass has all the fun puzzle and adventure elements that fans of the series have come to expect.  Making inventive use of the touch screen and stylus controls, Phantom Hourglass may take some getting used to in this department, but once you do, you'll have a blast.  Since this is a direct sequel to Wind Waker, the game follows the same graphical and gameplay styles, meaning the cartoonish, diminuitive Link that we came to love (and in the case of a good amount of players, hated) is here, as are the sailing elements.  Fortunately, some improvements have been made for the DS, particularly the sailing parts which are performed much better here.  Graphically, Phantom Hourglass boasts some of the best visuals of any DS game.  The boss battles are wonderful, and the environments are inventive as well, rounding out another masterpiece in the Legend of Zelda series.  The only real downside to Phantom Hourglass is that the touch screen controls, as I've said before, take a bit of getting used to.  Gamers may be turned off by not using the traditional control scheme we've come to expect from a portable Zelda game, but once you get past that, it's smooth sailing (literally).  Not to mention that if the differently designed art style from Wind Waker wasn't your cup of tea, Phantom Hourglass' visuals won't win you over.  All that aside, Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass is a smashing title for the DS and the franchise, and undoubtedly one of the best games to hit the system yet.",5,One of the best games to hit the DS yet,2007/10/3 0:00

I've been waiting for something like this to come along amongst the kiddy/crappy games that have been pouring out like diarrhea. Zelda uses everything on the DS...I mean EVERYTHING. You never lift your stylus off the screen and you hardly use the face buttons (in fact you don't even have too) Zelda has some of the finest graphics, game play elements, and stories on the DS thus far. You can use your stylus to move Link around, draw the path of your boomerang, use new weapons such as Bombchus and draw its path to get to unexplored areas, draw the path or your grapple hook or link the poles together to make a slingshot, use your bow and arrow to unlock puzzles and other hidden items...these are just some of the great ideas for the weapons and gadgets throughout the game. You can also kill some enemies by making a lot of noise (via clapping in the mic) to make it vulnerable, scream in the mic when NPCs tell you to for hidden items, even close your DS to copy contents from one map to another! You can draw hidden symbols on doors to unlock as well. You can draw on your map to mark certain locations so you don't get lost or even take notes to solve puzzles! There is just so much care and detail in this game it's almost perfect.Every boss fight is cleverly laid out. For example on the second boss fight you fight a giant squid that shoots cyclones at you. He is up in the air at the top and you have to use the cyclones at the bottom screen to aim up top and throw bombs at him. Some boss fights are three stories tall! The story in the game is great and charming. You have to save Princess Zelda (in this game she's Tetra) from the Ghost Ship that caught her when you and your pirate friends were treasure hunting. You wake up in a new world and you have to help restore the Ocean King's powers by defeating the evil Bellum. Now a new element here is ship sailing. You have the Phantom Hourglass which let's you explore the Ocean King's Temple without getting your life drained and you're timed...yeah like Zelda dungeons aren't bad enough without a timer. You can draw your route on your map and sail away. You can customize your ship with parts that you find throughout the world. You can salvage for treasure at the bottom of the sea via a mini-game where you direct a crane to the chest and pull it up. There's just so much in this game it's insane. One nice feature is the online mode. Yes the first online Zelda game. It's a battle mode where you play the Phantoms or Link and you have to put the three tri force pieces in the slots to open the door and the other team are Phantoms that try to stop you. Yes it's interesting but nothing really special.This is a WONDERFUL and beautifully crafted game and is even better than Twilight Princess. The only reason why I don't give this game a 10 is because underneath all the hardware specific quirks...the Zelda formula hasn't changed. You still have spots where it's impossible to solve on your own. Some dungeons are unforgiving. All that is still there. Despite those things it doesn't matter.

And this time Nintendo has decided to put a spin on the series by making a game that is controlled entirely by the touch screen.  The result is a game that's good, but not perfect.  While it still has some pretty great elements, you can't help but wish you had a D-Pad option as well.Link and Tetra are hunting for a Ghost ship as the game begins.  The ship appears and Tetra boards it.  When something goes wrong, Link attempts to save her, but instead falls into the ocean.  He washes up on the shore of an island where a fairy named Ciela agrees to help him find Tetra.  He'll have to be prepared, though.  He's about to go on a long journey.Phantom Hourglass is a great addition to the Zelda library.  The story is a good one.  Carried out, of course, by dialog boxes.  Much like many of Nintendo's franchises, there isn't really any voice acting here.  Not a problem.  The presentation of the game is good enough.  Actually, in terms of bringing out 3D effects, this is probably one of the DS's best looking games to date.  There are moments where some things look a little pixilated, but it still looks good.  It doesn't play like the 3D adventures, however.  No matter how powerful the DS is, this game still plays similar to the other handheld games.  That is to say you're not in a 3D environment.  It's an overhead view of everything.  So it's not an entirely 3D world.The control scheme is what makes Phantom Hourglass such a unique experience.  The game is entirely touch screen oriented.  You'll use the stylus to lead Link around.  You can make him pick up pots and barrels by tapping on them and tapping on an empty section of the screen to throw them.  By tracing a quick ring on the screen you can make Link roll.Even better is swordplay and using items.  You'll tap on enemies to make Link stab them.  You can perform a horizontal slash by drawing a straight line.  You can perform a spinslash by drawing a quick circle around Link.  Even using items is put to good use.  You'll draw a path for the boomerang to follow when you throw it, for example.  You can make Link toss bombs to certain locations.  Using the bow and arrows has never been easier.A lot of the games challenge comes from the puzzles rather than the enemies, though.  The touch screen controls make taking out most enemies, including bosses, relatively easy.  The game may introduce a new mechanic but its entirely too easy to take advantage of.  Along those lines, the controls are sometimes a bit touchy.  It can be taxing to make Link roll, for example.  It can also be annoying when you do something you don't mean to do at all.  It's a pain when you want to make Link do one thing and he does something else.  So while the controls are good, they can be a bit touchy at times.During play, the map is displayed at the top at all times.  During play, you can bring it down and mark on it.  Throughout your journey characters will constantly be telling you where to go and show you on the map.  It helps to mark it.  It also helps when solving certain puzzles as well.All these controls are tight and intuitive, but they're not for everyone.  It's a shame Nintendo didn't put in the option to switch controls to the more traditional D-Pad and buttons.  There are some gamers, without a doubt, who would've loved to have this option.Phantom Hourglass is a great game.  The controls work well.  They can be touchy at times, and its a shame Nintendo didn't put in an option to change them up, but at least the end product is one that many Zelda fans will enjoy.Pros:+Good storyline+Fantastic graphics+Good music+Intuitive controls+Great dungeon designsCons:-There's no option to switch to the more traditional D-Pad and button controls-Sometimes the controls are quite touchy",5,A Fun and Engaging Game,2007/11/20 0:00

A36UKFV79879MD,B000FW64OY,BX Lounger,2,2,"Starfox is one of Nintendo's most popular franchises and in 2006, they continue the series by releasing Starfox Command for the Nintendo DS. This marks the first time Starfox appears on the DS and in taking advantage of how it works, it's the first time touch screen controls have been incorporated in the game. So, take the touch screen controls, the classic Starfox universe and gameplay and what do you get? A rather odd mix of old and new Starfox gameplay that's hit or miss.Starfox DS has everyone from the Starfox universe return for an all new adventure with a new main villain taking over for Andross as Lylat is in danger of being invaded. You take control of Fox McCloud as he is joined by his team to shoot down the enemies. Go from stage to stage in which you must eliminate all threats on the screen while using the stylus to draw your flight of path. For the first time, there's RTS elements in a Starfox game where using a limited amount of turns, you must defeat all enemies before you run out of turns, lose all your lives and have the enemies reach the Great Fox (massive ship where Starfox reports to.) You control your ship using your stylus for most of the time while pressing any of the buttons will shoot your lasers and bombs. Your progress is saved directly to your cart. When you want to take a break from the story mode, there 's a tutorial mode to show you how to move your ship and an online multi-player mode to take against other players from around the world.The PROS: Nintendo did not mess around this time as the Starfox universe never looked better. The graphics, music and sound effects are excellent. They wanted to keep the gameplay fresh so adding the new RTS influence along with the classic frantic dogfights in the air this game is known for was a smart move. This also brings in a new and unique challenge so players will be kept busy trying to complete the game. Since most players wanted to take the fight online, now they can as this game was meant to have online multi-player enabled so see how good you are compared to players around the world.The CONS: Adding new elements to a tried and true formula is always risky as some people may or may not welcome the changes. In this case, Starfox Command falls into this category. While controlling the ship with a stylus seems practical, it takes getting used to. Most players will have to use the tutorial mode since it's easy to forget how to swing the stylus in the heat of battle compared to using the directional pad and shoulder buttons on a traditional controller. Also, depending on whether you like RTS games, you may or may not like going through turns and phases before you enter the action and that forces you to use strategy not unlike you've seen in an action game. I'm not sure if there is an online community for this game because when I connected online, it took forever for me to find other players to play against and after a few matches they disconnected. After a few tries for a couple of weeks, I rarely found anyone online.Starfox Command will certainly be remembered as the game where Nintendo tried some different things with it. It's clear that people loved it while others weren't too keen on the changes. You can tell that I wasn't too keen on it either. While the game looks and sounds great, I found the stylus-only controls were hard to get used and since I'm not into RTS games, I didn't like the turns and phases portion of the game as well. Connecting online was easy and while the matches I played online went smoothly, finding others to play was easier said than done.If you don't mind the changes they introduced to this Starfox title, give it a try. I commend them to keeping the game play fresh but it just didn't feel right to me in the end. It might be different for you but only if you're willing to play it for yourself.",3,An odd mix of old and new Starfox gameplay,2011/8/15 0:00

From the highly acclaimed adventures of Mario, to the puzzled-maddening addiction of the classic Tetris games, many of them have gone through a great, and driven transition. For the Star Fox franchise, many gamers felt that the appeal of the game series was a diaster from the past few games. Although the game system handled well on the revolutionary Star Fox 64, for the Nintendo 64, many felt the game franchise missed out completely from the Nintendo Gamecube era: 2005's Star Fox Assault, and 2002's Star Fox Adventures. Can Fox McCloud and company reclaim the fame so many thought missed out before?Star Fox Command for the Nintendo DS, tries to go back tothe original appeal Nintendo captured with it from Star Fox 64, and the original Star Fox from the Super NES system. This edition is all about flying, and plenty of it. The object though this time is you're battling against the clock, and how fast you have to shoot down several enemy combat planes. This time, the manuverability is really all from the stylus, which is unfortunately the biggest flaw of the game. It takes much more time to get used to, especially with trying to unlock missions, and several characters. The music for the game though does have the high-flying action, except for when Fox and company and trying to talk. The combat action though is very challenging, for anybody who wants a challenge, but for others, they might feel this is a turnoff.All in all, I just wish Star Fox Command could've been a better Nintendo DS title. It is a challenge for die hard fans of the franchise, but for others who've backed away from the Gamecube games, they'd might want to reconsider going back.

Star Fox Command returns the series to it's dog-fighting, space shooting roots that made the series such a hit on the Super NES and N64 years ago, by ditching out of the ship platforming and rail based missions in favor of some pretty wide open environments and some innovative features using the touch screen to help pilot your ship.  The graphics are some of the best to be seen on the DS so far, despite some polygonal break up here and there, visually the game still packs a punch.  The touch screen features are also some of the best of any game to take advantage of on the DS, and the multiple strategic options and braching storylines help make Star Fox Command a winner.  The only real drawbacks of Star Fox Command is that it's ultimately too short and may be too easy for some, but the multiplayer modes are fun enough (only needing one DS card to play with others is always something to be happy about), and the WiFi capabilities are a nice touch as well.  All in all, while it's not perfect, Star Fox Command is yet another great, first party DS game that further helps sell the dual screened hand held as the best portable system on the market today.",4,Fox McCloud is back,2006/9/12 0:00
A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000FW64OY,S. Rhodes,84,74,"The Nintendo DS has enjoyed much success lately.  Star Fox Command joins the ranks of being one of Nintendo's better DS games out there.  It has a couple of misses, but it excels heavily in the places where it counts.  Star Fox Command is a fantastic handheld gaming experience.The Star Fox team, after defeating Andross, has disbanded.  Soon afterwards, a new threat known as the Anglar has emerged.  It's up to Fox McCloud to deal with these foes, and there's no way he can go at it alone.  When you first go through the game, there's not really a whole lot you can do, and the story doesn't seem very satisfying.  In fact, the first time through the game the path you go is completely set for you.  The standard storyline is pretty short and easy.  The good news is once you complete the standard story you can choose different paths to take, and uncover several different endings in the process. Each character has his/her own storyline.  In short, the game will keep you busy for a while.Star Fox Command definitely sports some fantastic graphics.  Perhaps even some of the best the DS has seen.  There's no slowdown, and the character models and storyboards are fantastically detailed.  It's far superior to Star Fox 64.  The graphics are just one of the high points of Star Fox Command.One of the high points of Star Fox Command is the gameplay.  While in the past Star Fox has pretty much been your standard flight/shooter.  Before it was to kill everything in sight.  Now the gameplay has taken on a more strategic feel.  Just about everything you do is done on the touch screen for the game.  At first it feels a little strange, but the execution is straight on.  You'll have to plot out your ships courses and then fly to them.This isn't to say you won't be doing any aerial combat. The game has a map mode and a battle mode.  When in battle mode it's basically the same as all-range mode on Star Fox 64.  This will mostly be used to battle bosses and shoot down enemies.  From time to time you'll have to do a chase"" mission. In these mission you'll have to fulfill special tasks, such as shooting down a missile.  The only thing the touch screen isn't used for is to shoot.  You'll use the face buttons (or directional buttons) for that.  Other than that, all your flying mechanics take place on the touch screen.There are plenty of things to beware in a mission, however.  The objective is mainly just to kill all the bad guys, but there are plenty of ways you can lose.  If the Great Fox is destroyed, or the time runs out, or you lose all your spare pilots, the game is over.  It may seem like a lot at first, but most of the areas to fight your missions in are pretty small, and it's not so hard to deal with everything going on at once.  Of all these assets that could cause you to lose a mission, the only one to pay any real attention to is making sure the Great Fox doesn't get destroyed.Star Fox also has multiplayer.  Up to six people can play off of one card.  Or you can go online and battle with three other people.  Multiplayer drops the strategic ploy, though and instead pits you in aerial combat against your friends (or online opponents).  Multiplayer basically consists of you shooting down your opponents and collecting the stars they drop.  It's on a time limit, though, so you have to work fast.  When the time runs out, the one with the most stars at the end wins.  Multiplayer is a blast, but there really should've been a lot more of it to go around.  There really aren't enough modes.There's no voice acting in Star Fox Command.  It's mostly the gibberish you heard in the original Star Fox on your SNES. However, the game does allow you to record your voice using the DS's microphone.  You can say a few things into your DS microphone and Fox, while in combat, will say these things in your tone of voice.  It's really cool, but doesn't really enhance the gameplay any at all.  It's just a neat little gimmick.Star Fox Command is a great game.  It has a couple of short-commings, but for the most part, it's a great gaming experience.  Star Fox fans should be pleased at the new strategic direction of the game, and the intuitive gameplay.On the Positive Side+The game looks absolutely gorgeous+The strategic gameplay is fairly addictive+The touch screen controls are great+Extras after you complete the main storyline+Different scenarios+Recording your own voice is pretty cool+There's MultiplayerOn the Negative side-The main storyline is rather short-The game is also rather easy-Multiplayer is fun, but severely limited-Even though it's really nice to record your own voice, it's rather sad that the characters don't have real voices, and instead have the same gibberish used in the original Star Fox""",4,Stunning Handheld Gaming at Your Command,2006/8/28 0:00

It had a briliant story, great environments, with a great ancient Greek mythology atmosphere. The story told of a Spartan warrior named Kratos, who is desperate to redeem for his past mistakes. He had pledged his life to the service of the god of war Ares in return for saving his life. Ares had tricked Kratos into killing his wife and only child. In the game he embarked on a quest to get his hands on the unfound pandora's box, containing the ultimate power capable of defeating a god. With this power Kratos managed to defeat Ares and become the new god of war in his place.I was thrilled when I heard a sequal was being made. However I was annoyed when I went to get this on the orginal release date and found I had to wait an extra month until its release. But I have the game now, so no worries. I got the game on the day it was released (it was a friday) and I completed it on monday. The game is just as good as the other, with the same moves, some extras and new weapons. Zeus betrays and murders Kratos. Kratos then seeks out the three legendary sisters, who are his only hope of returning to the past an changing his fate. He attempts to return to when Zeus betrayed him and murder Zeus himself. The game ended with a cliffhanger, indicating there will be a God of War 3. But that of course will be an extra 2 years. Less hopefully.Which one is harder to beat? God of war 1, or God of War 2? There was a point in the first game that took ages for me to get through. It was in the underworld, when you climb the rotating spiked tower. Yet there was no difficult moments in God of War 2. Yet in God of War 2 there were more things to get through that required logic skills, some I got stuck on, but I only got stuck on 1 in the first game. That's something I must warn you about.

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000G6SPHI,"Cloud ...""""",4,2,"When the first God of War came out, you almost couldn't escape the massive hype and praise it received. From its gameplay to its outrageous violence and emotional storyline"", many critics and fans alike absolutely fell in love with it...except me. Sure gameplay-wise it was slightly fun at times but it was unbelievably repetitive, needlessly frustrating at times and the storyline wasn't exactly emotional at all. So of course the inevitable sequel comes out during the Playstation 2's final days and like many blockbusters, it's bigger, it's badder but not necessarily better.Story: Despite my grievances about the presentation about the original's storyline which felt more emotionally neutered despite the scenes revealing Kratos' past, this game just feels wrong. Instead of redemption and atonement for his sins, this game is basically a big hissy fit on his part when he's ""Metroid""'d of his powers and has to face Zeus. This is essentially like hunting Ares only this time it's Zeus.Graphics: Of course the graphics impress although not much has changed since the original. The world still feels believable and interactive and the level design, while a step down, is still nicely done. Where the game shines, as usual, are its FMV's which are very cinematic and sharp in their quality.Sound/Music: Aside from the VA actor doing Kratos who essentially just plays ""angry"" throughout the whole thing, everyone almost has a B-movie quality in their voice. As for the music, it's sound big and epic with its choir and strings but it's largely forgettable with nary a memorable hook anywhere.Gameplay: Basically the main thing is the combos. Blessed with many weapons and skills, Kratos has to fight (and fight) legions of enemies with big, complex moves. While they look cool, you'll soon discover quickly some work better than others and you'll just end up re-using them. As well, Kratos is given some new spells such as a bow and arrow, lightning and others. Nothing new really as changed, just the names. Whether it's a case of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" or just simply a lack of wanting to change things up is anyone's guess.As for the game itself, there are times where it's a bit frustrating but it seems almost more tolerable. There's still things like repeatedly pressing a button to open doors which was a dumb idea although trying to stab minotaurs no longer requires you to quickly press the O button and have your fingers fall off like the last one. Puzzles, unlike the more brain-teasers of Zelda and Ico, are strictly relegated to trial and error. Try that. Nope, died. Try this. Nope, died. Oh ok, so you do this?  Ah, there we go. That's it, no logic benders or things that make you think, just exhaust all possibilities of a solution till you finally find it.Is this a game worth buying? Well if you've loved the last one, you'll love this one too although how much more is hard to say.

You are still a powerful warrior, still taking on the various gods in a quest for survival and power.I've seen many sequels over the years. Often they are awful - just trying to get more money for the exact same product. I'm really happy to say that the God of War team did a great job here with God of War 2. They really listened to feedback, worked on their game and created a new version that is even better than the original.The graphics are just stellar. Sweeping movements, detailed backgrounds, action-filled situations. It's still a little dark for me - in terms of hard to see. You can make a game seem rich and dangerous without having it be a foggy gloom. Still, I appreciate their artistic intent here.The vocals are stunning. They've won numerous awards for this series and they are well deserved. Epic, beautiful to listen to.The game really draws you in. From the very first second you are immersed in battles that you really enjoy fighting in. There are varied enemies, each ones that you feel driven to take on and conquer. I admit that sometimes it can be a little confusing - you try repeatedly to take action X, only to discover through trial and error that it will never work until first you do action Y. Still, these types of inconveniences can be found in most games.Should you play God of War 1 before you move on to God of War 2? I would say yes. There's a lot of storyline and background here - and God of War 1 was definitely a fantastic game. By all means, track down a version of God of War 1 first and play through it. Then load in God of War 2 and see how the game progresses from there, how the characters evolve and change.Well recommended for any action gamer.

So in that case, it's safe to say that the long awaited God of War II is the last, best original game to hit Sony's 128-bit juggernaut.  Picking up right where the first game left off, Kratos was successful in killing Ares, and now resides as the God of War in on Mount Olympus.  However, Zeus has grown displeased with Kratos, and the Spartan warrior soon finds himself cast into Hades.  After striking a deal with Gaia of the Titans, Kratos is once again on a very long, and very violent, journey of revenge.  The first thing you may notice when you pop in God of War II is that the game's graphics are astounding for a PS2 game.  The first game pushed the limits of what the PS2 could pump out, and God of War II exceeds it.  Besides that, the game ups the ante on just about everything that made the first game so great.  The level design is superbly done, and the boss battles are more plentiful this time around, and all the more epic as well.  Not to mention that the game's music score is even better than the fantastic one found in the first game.  And oh yeah, the incredibly brutal fighting and blood-letting is here as well, and there's buckets more to be found.  The kills are gorier than one could ever expect, and the game more than earns it's Mature rating.  The puzzle elements are more difficult this time around as well, wonderfully rounding out this package.  If there's any downside to God of War II, it's that the fighting system itself hasn't changed much.  There are still times when button mashing rules, but Kratos gets a few new weapons and magics this time around too.  Besides that, everything else about God of War II is superb: from it's narrative to it's voice acting, to it's overall epic feel; God of War II is one of the best titles available for the PS2, period.  This is one of those rare cases when the sequel outshines and outdoes it's genre-bending predecessor, and maybe the third installment will make the PS3 worth owning.  All in all, God of War II is a masterpiece of modern gaming.",5,Sending the PS2 off with a vengeance,2007/3/14 0:00
A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000G6SPHI,S. Rhodes,3,2,"How do you follow up a game like God of War?  The first one was incredible.  A thrill ride filled to the brim with complex puzzles and gameplay unmatched by most platformers of the day.  In the end it turned out to be one of the most successful Playstation 2 games out there.  So how do you follow up such a smash hit?  The answer, very carefully, and that's exactly what God of War II does.  It keeps the elements of the first one that worked, while being sure to tweak with a few minor things.  The end result is exactly what a video game sequel should be.  True to the first one.Once again you assume the role of Kratos, the God of War.  He still commands the Spartan Army, and continues to conquer the land.  However, his actions have led to the Olympian Gods being disappointed in him and thus he is betrayed by them.  Thanks to Gaia of the Titans, however, Kratos is able to live and go on another epic journal to once more change his fate.  The journal is difficult and perilous, but it's no problem for a God of War such as Kratos.As far as the story goes, God of War II is just as absorbing as the first one was.  If it's been a while since your trip through the first game, you may want to play it again just in case because the two games link almost directly, and there will be a few references you may or may not pick up on.The gameplay in God of War II hasn't really changed from the first one.  In fact, it's almost exactly the same.  You'll romp through the game slashing and killing things in a bloodfest.  This game is a bit bloodier than the first one, but that's to be expected.  It's also a little romped up in the difficulty.  Much like the first one, however, there's a lot of button mashing involved in the combat.  Simply put, as long as you keep swinging your blades you can survive.  You've also got magic and other weapons you can use throughout your journey, but the problem with this little mechanic is much like the first one, spells and such become useless after a while.  Once you get passed the point where you actually need a spell, there's no reason to ever use it again.  While you get some pretty nifty weapons, none of them are as comforting to play around with as the default.  In short, there's a lot of variety here, but no real reason to explore it.As with the first game, there are a ton of puzzles throughout God of War II.  In the first game there were plenty of difficult and sometimes frustrating puzzles.  I'd be lying if I said the same wasn't true of the second game.  There are a few frustrating puzzles, but nothing quite so frustrating it can't be done.  A lot of the puzzles are actually very well constructed and crafted.  Even the ones that'll frustrate you, you'll appreciate the complexity to them.As far as the game looks, this may very well be the last fantastic looking Playstation 2 game.  It doesn't look that strikingly different from the first one, but there is a lot more detail to the environments.  There are just times when you want to stop and take a look at everything.  Even better, there's hardly (if any) slowdown in framerate.  Everything runs smoothly.Then there's the audio.  As with the first game, God of War II has a fantastic soundtrack that accurately depicts each situation and the mood of each situation.  Even better, the voice acting is top notch.  Just like watching an actual movie.  As far as the sound and audio go, God of War II should be a game developers use as an example of how to do voice talent right.There's not a whole lot that separates God of War II from the first one, and that's a good thing.  While it feels almost entirely like the first one, the story and dedication to keeping true to what works is what makes God of War II just as good as its predecessor.  This may very well be the last great game on the Playstation 2.  If you liked the first God of War, then you'll absolutely love God of War II.On the Positive Side+Fantastic overall story+Simple and addictive gameplay+Complex puzzles and fantastic level design+Great visual look+Overall fantastic voice acting+One of the greatest soundtracks ever composed in gaming+Stays true to the original God of WarOn the Negative Side-Some frustrating puzzles-Lots of variety, but a lot of spells and weapons become useless rather fast-While the gameplay is fun and addictive it's almost reduced to mere button mashing, although that's not really too bad",5,A God on the PS2,2007/3/26 0:00

That said, I had many moments during the play of God of War II where I could really tell that the people who made this game went out of their way to make sure you get more.  More action, more intensity, surprisingly more character development, and a rather clever way to dovetail the fiction of Kratos (your character) into Greek Mythology.As Kratos, the God of War, you find yourself stripped of power and determined to go beyond vengeance:  the Titans have found you, and you will use their powers to seek the Fates and undo the very existence of Olympus.  How this quest ends, I will leave to you to discover.  In the meantime, get ready for the testosterone ride of your life.  Massive amounts of crazed combat, wild scenes, and clever puzzles await you.  In an RPG-like fashion, you can control which skills you upgrade, and how far you take them.  You also unlock bonus play features when the game is beaten (even on Easy difficulty), and can take part in multiple challenges, find hidden items to use later, and more.Well worth the money, and one of a small number of superior titles for the Playstation.""",5,Finally!

A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B000GABOTU,"Christopher Barrett Evil Corgi""""",1,1,"There are some good and bad reviews here, but I think overall this is a great game.  Final Fantasy 3 was probably the best NES game not released in the US. (NES not SNES... that would belong to FFV).  So for the wonderful DS, we get a shiny new release (from the same crew who did FFIV DS and FF Heroes of Light). And it rocks.I actually lost my original DS copy after playing through to about Viking Cove.  I played through most of the game on my NES emulator afterwards and then stopped when I decided to re-buy the game and re-start on the DS.The DS version keeps the heart and soul of the original.  The music is a remastered version of the original, so it's nice to hear the beeping original sounds replaced with a more orchestral sounding score (despite the limited DS hardware).  Graphics are improved while retaining the traditional feel of the original.  Things are a tad more 3-d, but it's still overall a top down view with the ability to 'zoom in' and check things out.  Look for those sparkles for secrets!Battles are different though.  Originally you could face off against up to 9 baddies.  Now you go against 1-3 normally (though there are instances where you might face 4).  The baddies are tougher.  Mainly their hp is a little higher and they are a bit harder to kill.  Spells can all hit multiple targets.  Good and bad since spells like poison and silence can hit your entire party as well!  Stock up on those items!The ability to change jobs on the fly is great.  I love the customization aspect of this title.  All of the jobs are equally impressive.  I enjoyed playing with a warrior, red mage, black mage, and white mage through the first part.  White mage is the weakest job until you get a fire (or other spell) rod and can then hit baddies with some hurt.  If you switch jobs, there is a slight 'down time' where your abilities are weakened and it takes a few battles (up to 10) to get over the reduction.  Makes it tough to switch jobs while deep in a cave or high in a tower, but that's life!  Also if you switch from a non mage job to a mage job, you have zero magic points.  True even if you switch from mage to non-mage to mage again.  You lose.Sometimes the graphics get annoying.  Typically when they clutter too many objects on screen.  This is mostly in houses within towns.  Dungeons are pretty slick though.  Once you get to the Tower of Owen you will see what I mean.Overall the game feels more like Final Fantasy 4 than Final Fantasy 1, despite the appearance of the original being so similar to FF1.  But the designers were already working on FF4 and some of the ideas that were going to be implemented in FF4 also went into this game.It's a long journey, one that will take around 30 hours if you try and complete most side quests and collect most items.  The difficulty is high, as well as the encounter rate being high, so don't expect to get through this game without seeing the game over screen at least once.  I've beaten every Final Fantasy and FF2 was the only one tougher than this in my opinion.  Though FF1 (the NES version) was pretty close to this in difficulty.  You will want to spend a bit of time level grinding, or if not, then save often.Saving often also became my mantra for this game when I entered the sealed cave, just to fight a couple of battles and see how tough... Unfortunately I hadn't saved since I was just Luneth in the party, all the way through getting all four characters... First battle were those copper coin things, hit and confused two of my party members in first round... yeah... couldn't escape... death ensued.  Then re-doing 30 minutes of running around to get the characters and talk to Cid and the king and... phew... so save OFTEN!  And some monsters will be strong enough to wipe you out and are made that way.  You cannot beat Bahamut, so he will kill you and give you game over if you do not run.  The sea monster will also kill you in two rounds since it gets two hits per round, hitting your level 10-13 characters for over 6000 damage.  (Save right after Viking Cove and don't get on the ship for the love of...). And that reminds me.  Enemies could only take one attack in the NES version (for example the boss Medusa was easy as cake because she only hit once, usually with an ineffective Break spell, but in this version she gets two attacks, usually a fire 2 spell or Break spell with a physical attack for the other), in this version the ability of several enemies to take multiple attacks per round adds some challenge.  Especially in those tough boss battles.But with patience comes reward.  This is a complex game and when you realize it was originally released on the NES and that this version keeps most of the original core of the game intact... you realize the sheer awesomeness of the NES original.  I am sad we missed this one back around 1990, 1991 but playing it on the emulator was fun.  Now playing the re-make on the DS is the final icing on the cake.  Thank you Square Enix for a job well done!Pros:+ Remarkably free from noticeable bugs or glitches.+ Very good, enjoyable remastered soundtrack.+ Lots of depth with class changes.+ Ability to change spells between members so they aren't 'stuck' with one character.+ Newly updated story with individual characters.+ Good difficulty level and decent encounter rate.+ Lots of stuff to do so a long adventure.+ Better job leveling system than the original.Cons:- Graphics generally good, but some areas hard to see.- Encounter rate might be too high for some.- Higher difficulty might turn off some who are used to later FF titles.- Zooming in or 'checking' for secret areas can get tedious.",5,Re-playing it now and am even more impressed!,2012/1/25 0:00
A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B000GABOTU,blackaciddevil,54,50,"I honestly don't see why Square Enix hasn't thought of doing this to all their older Final Fantasy games, really. It would definitely appeal to the newer Final Fantasy audiences who's grownup on all the 3-D games(all the while, giving them a good history lesson on the FF games) yet appeal to us older Final Fantasy fans with its' old school style. I liked it better when the stories were simpler to follow. That's not to say I dislike the newer Final Fantasy games, though. Things change through the years as do I and I love those games just as much.The game starts off with you(Luneth) assembling a team of heroes(Arc, Refia, and Ingus) to restore balance to the world. To do this, you must choose jobs(23 in all) to help aid you in your quest. Every battle you play through will add to each of the character's job level so you'll want to use thought in building not only your characters main level, but also their job proficiency as well. Although Final Fantasy III is a Very challenging game, it's also an entertaining one. I wish the Nintendo DS had more RPGs done in this style. I simply couldn't get enough of the game and kept on finding myself fighting one more battle & whatnot before putting it down. You'll explore the lands, man a boat, pilot an airship, ride a chocobo, find treasure, and more. Not only that but the game is simply beautiful. I agree, it's simply a better overall experience in 3-D.Maybe it's just me, though, but I get a distinct Final Fantasy VII feel with this game. Don't ask me how but I do. That's a good thing, though.All in all, you're looking at an RPG that clocks in around the 50/60 hour mark depending on how you play.

Unlike the recent ports of V and VI, III got a huge upgrade in graphics and some redesigns and it's all the better for it. But there's still some things that are stuck in the past and how better would it have been if it was implemented. You're still going to get a pretty good Final Fantasy title with gorgeous graphics and the time-consuming Job system (in a good way) but other things knock down the game a tad.Story: It's pretty much the same as I and II: crystals are going haywire and 4 people are chosen to restore them and save the land. Yawn. But really, they were made at a time before things got ambitious like future titles VII or VIII or story-extensive ones like Xenogears. In other words, you're not going to really get anything major as far as plot revelations and if there is any twists, you'll most likely see some of them coming.Graphics: A lot of people will give high marks on the graphics front on the opening FMV alone. And I won't lie to you, it's quite awesome. It has that majestic quality that IX's opening had while having some pretty great action scenes as well. As for in-game graphics, they're pretty good actually. 3-D world with a tilted overworld camera, the graphics are impressive if you think in terms of DS capabilities. Only problem is that you can't rotate the camera, there's certain areas where it would've helped if you can turn.Sound/Music: Music's serviceable but it's not really memorable either. You'd have to probably listen to each track separately to focus on them since you don't really pay that much attention to them. That's not to say it's a bad soundtrack, of course not. But tracks probably won't instantly grab you like future installments where you can't help but notice how good the music is. There's no voice acting and the sound effects are appropriate but obviously not flashy.Gameplay: Same as always with options such as attack, magic, items and so on. But this game brought about the job system which got favored heavily when people played Final Fantasy Tactics. At certain points, your character can branch off into other classes, enabling a more diverse party. Want someone entirely devoted to protecting and healing the party? White Mage. Someone to throw powerful spells? Black Mage? Both? Red Mage. Then we get others such as Dragoons, Geomancers, Ninjas, Thieves, Monks, Bards and Knights. Of course some are more useful (Dragoons and Monks are especially sweet) but then some seem kind of useless.As for the difficulty, it can get frustrating at times. Instead of halfway save points and then the save point just before the boss, you basically save before the dungeon, take a deep breath and barrel through in hopes you make it through to the boss and kick its ***. You can leave to regroup but then you'd have to go back in and try again and should you get beaten, you have to start all over again. Doesn't help when some enemies can get 2 turns, especially bosses which gets even worse when Phoenix Downs don't even give your character much HP back so you'd probably revive only to have them wiped out again before you can cure them.Speaking of which, one major issue I had in the Dawn of Souls release was inns didn't revive dead characters. I spent my gil to rest my characters only to find my guy still dead. Here though we have 2 wellsprings: one that revives fallen characters while one acts as a rejuvenation spring but I don't think they cure status effects such as blind or poison. So to revive, use one pool; to heal, use the other and to heal/remove status effects, use an inn. It's pretty much your only option since Phoenix Downs can only be found or won in battle so those pools will be lifesavers.While it's not quite the great top-tier release reserved for Square games (since it most likely went towards XII) but still you'll get a solid game but if you're new, prepare to be schooled...in a fun way.",5,4.5; solid remake in need of small remaking,2007/3/6 0:00

Now, let me start off by saying that this is not the Final Fantasy III you played, loved, and worshipped on the Super Nintendo years ago; that game is being re-released as Final Fantasy VI Advance on the GBA eventually (hopefully).  This instead is the real FF III which never made it here from overseas, and it has been remade and restructured to fit perfectly for Nintendo's smash hit handheld.  The graphics have been given a big facelift, and that's saying it lightly.  The character sprites have been replaced with full on 3-D effects that look great for a DS game, and the storyline has been tweaked as well.  Everything else about FF III is an old school RPG gamer's dream come true, even if the touch screen features feel tacked on and unnecessary.  Everything else about FF III though is a pure delight, and the Wi-Fi features are nice to say the least.  All in all, DS owners looking for an excellent RPG to pass the time should look no further; their prayers have been answered.",5,Welcome home,2006/11/23 0:00
A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000GABOTU,S. Rhodes,182,177,"After sixteen long years, Final Fantasy III finally sees an official release outside of Japan.  However, unlike previous games, Final Fantasy III has been completely reworked.  This is more than just a port with enhanced graphics.  Final Fantasy III includes some new secrets and side quests in addition to its graphical overhaul.  Final Fantasy III may be just about enough to please some hardcore fans, but was the wait really worth it?  Well, yes, but the game isn't perfect.The storyline of Final Fantasy III is entirely too simple.  The crystals are losing their powers and there are only four warriors that can come forth and save the world from falling into darkness.  Sixteen years ago this was a pretty standard story, but when compared to your average RPG today, and current Final Fantasy games, the storyline to Final Fantasy III is a joke.  There's nothing in this story that screams epic, and the characters involved aren't developed very well.  Luckily, we can let it slide because its sixteen years old.Gameplay wise, Final Fantasy III is pretty similar to most RPGs of today.  You'll go roaming through dungeons and towns getting into random battles.  There are a few quirks to the game that the DS utilizes.  You'll find moments where you'll have to zoom into certain objects for you to examine.  It should also be noted that you can use the touch screen almost exclusively in the game.  Using the stylus you can make your character run in the direction you want him to, by gliding it across the screen.  Taping on things makes your character examine it, and ultimately this is how you open chests and talk to people.  It works out, but it feels really clumbsy at times.  If you're looking to get through a dungeon with little hassle, just stick to the directional buttons.  To its credit, though, using the stylus makes menu navigation much faster, but for the most part, the stylus controls just feel tacked on.Combat is traditional turn based combat.  There's no ATB gauge like in later Final Fantasy games.  In each round you will choose all the commands for your characters to do, and then watch a round of battle take place.  It's simple, but isn't always fun.  Mainly because Final Fantasy III is a challenge.  If you began with some of the later Final Fantasy games, then this installment may be a little too difficult.  Sometimes combat is unforgiving, especially when faced with bosses that attack twice per turn, and have the power to take out a character in a single shot.  Even worse, the encounter rate is pretty high and running away from battle is often a wasted effort because you'll fail so many times trying to do so.  You'll probably get wiped out just trying to run from battle and failing so many times.  There are several moments when you'll be forced to battle for hours just leveling up.  This is fine for those used to old school RPGs, but many RPGs of today do not put so much emphasis on leveling up, and it may try your patience after a while.  It's great for people looking for a challenge, at least, but for some it may be a bit too steep.The job system is interesting.  As you go through the game you'll get crystal shards that allow your characters to use certain jobs.  Each job has its own set of abilities that can be learned with it.  For example, White mages specialize in the healing arts, black mages in attack magic and red mages can do a little bit of both.  You've also got other classes like warriors who can take damage for other party members, thieves who can steal and much more.  There are 23 jobs in all.  The jobs you choose for your characters also have an impact on your stats.  Mages, for example, don't have a lot of strength but they excel in magic.  Also, as you gain levels, you'll also gain job levels.  So it's not only important to make sure your characters are at a good level, but also at a good job level.There is a slight problem with the job system however.  It isn't nearly as varied as it could be.  As you go through the game you'll gain more and more jobs that ultimately replace the older ones.  In the beginning you'll get a Blackmage; as you progress you'll get a Sage, who is capable of doing everything a Blackmage can do.  Thus, later in the game, many job classes become obsolete.  It's really hard to compliment the games variety when later on many job classes are more of the same thing.  So while the job system is interesting, later games such as Final Fantasy V execute it much better and with more variety.The game looks absolutely stunning, at least for the Nintendo DS.  It is by far one of the best looking out there.  There are some moments where it looks pixilated, but you can't deny that the game just looks good regardless.  The movie sequences are also really pretty to look at and they run surprisingly well.  In battle is also fantastic.  Your enemies sport some amazing detail and so do the backgrounds in battle.  On the whole, the game just looks good.  Perhaps the only fault of the graphics is how restricted the animation of characters and enemies are in combat.  Your characters won't physically go up and strike an enemy.  Rather they just step forward and swing.  Very similar to how the Final Fantasy games of the NES worked.  It's strange to see, but you'll quickly get used to it.Another thing that seems kind of strange, though, is that the top screen throughout most of the game remains blank.  All the action takes place on the bottom screen.  There are few moments when the top screen actually displays anything.  You'll see the world map as you travel the overworld and while you're in towns.  There are certain moments where the top screen has text, or shows an important story sequence, but that's usually about it.  Other than that, when trumping through dungeons (as you do often) and in battle (as you also do often) the top screen remains blank.  There's nothing wrong with it, but it feels very awkward to play a Nintendo DS game where the top screen is blank.  They could've used it to display dungeon maps or enemy information or something.  The top screen has no impact on gameplay whatsoever.The music in the game is pretty good, though.  It's not as good as other games in the series, and there are some tunes that just aren't great, but the music is by no means bad.  There's no voice acting in the game, really, but we can let that slide.  Audio wise, the game is good.Final Fantasy III is a pretty satisfying experience for any Final Fantasy fan looking for a good challenge, and to see how far the series has come.  However, it may also shed a little too much of its old school charm in some areas, particularly its unforgiving challenge.  Still, it's worth it for Final Fantasy fans who want to see just how far the series has come.The Good+Finally a chance to play Final Fantasy III+Great visual look+Good music+The job system is interesting+It provides a good challenge+A fair amount of secrets and sidequestsThe Bad-The story is not all that great-For some the game might provide too much of a challenge, to the point of frustration-High random encounter rate-The job system is interesting, but there's not nearly as much vareity as one might expect from it-Throughout most of your adventure the top screen is just... blank... for a Nintendo DS game this just feels awkward",4,Complete the Final Fantasy Collection,2006/11/15 0:00
A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B000GABOTU,Winter,3,3,"I'm lucky enough to have the older Final Fantasy III for the Game Boy to compare with this title, and I have to tell you, Square Enix has done a nice job bringing it over to the Game Boy's powerful cousin the Nintendo DS.  While some DS titles seem to incorporate the stylus just to have an excuse to drag the stylus into the picture, Final Fantasy III DS really does make it easy and fun to use:  drag the stylus around the screen and watch your little character walk along behind it.  Pull the stylus further away and he starts running to catch up.  Where older titles required to you sometimes rub up against the locals in order to be able to get them to talk with the A"" button, here a quick tap on the person starts up the dialogue.Those of you more comfortable with the classic controls will be pleased to know that the D-pad and buttons still work exactly the same way they used to if you'd rather use them.If you haven't played Final Fantasy III before, this is probably the friendliest (and best-looking) way to get into it.  If you've never played any Final Fantasy games at all before, I'd also say this title is a good place to start if you just want a glimpse of ""the early years"" without having to go all the way back to the beginning.  The DS makeover is top to bottom, tweaking menus to be a bit more pleasant to the eye, bringing more and brighter colors into the picture, and definitely putting the DS' graphics chip to good use prettying everything up.  Probably the only thing here that doesn't really work is the idea of zooming in and out.  It's a useful tool because some hidden items can be discovered by getting an up-close view--switches, levers, candlesticks that open secret doors, and sparkling spots that hide goodies.  Unfortunately, it isn't always easy to move in and out of with the shoulder button (or tapping the icon).  That said, it doesn't really hinder the gameplay:  it's just a nice idea that doesn't quite gel.If you're familiar with console RPGs, you'll be pleased with how Final Fantasy III handles the little details.  For example, when you're shopping in a store, you'll see cartoons of your characters:  when you're examining an item, each character who can use the item will light up and wave at you.  It's actually quite cute.  It's also easier to tell at a glance if you already own an item, how many you have in your bag or are equipped on a character, and whether a particular item will make things better or worse if you buy it.When it comes to the gameplay, the story is similar to most in that you play a hero who bands together a party and off they go to fight a world-threatening evil and save the day.  It also openly recycles the Final Fantasy I plot of ""four warriors come together to unite the four crystals and restore balance between light and dark.""  However, there's a new twist in that instead of having a party with many members and you can only take so many out of the box at a time, instead you have four, and YOU get to control what kind of character you want them to be.  If you turn one character into a Monk and it's not useful, they can ""change jobs"" and try their hand as a mage.  There's a short break-in period where they're really limited, and then off they go, leveling through their ""job"" just like they level as a character.  Each character also has their own custom abilities that expand the choices:  you can choose to have your fighter do an attack that rushes in and does a lot more damage, but leaves him more vulnerable to taking damage.  Or you can have your Monk stand and defend, and he'll attack anyone who attacks him, very useful when fighting 3 or more opponents.All in all, this port is FUN to play.  It's somewhat relaxing, it gets easier as you get the hang of it, and the graphical makeover that Square have done makes the entire experience more enjoyable.  Highly recommended for anyone who'd like to play old-school with a newer look.""",5,Classic Cleverly Cleaned Up,2010/2/12 0:00
A36UKFV79879MD,B000GIXIPK,BX Lounger,0,0,"Hot off the heels and success of Konami's Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow, they went back to the drawing board and developed a brand new game for the Nintendo DS. Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin was released in 2006 and made improvements in just about every area of the game. Overall, it's a better effort than Dawn of Sorrow and was made for the fans.If you've played Dawn of Sorrow, then you will immediately feel at home. Portrait of Ruin is very similar to the previous title in terms of gameplay, controls and acquiring weapons, accessories, relics and magic spells. This time around, you control two main characters. Each of them has their own strengths, weaknesses and preference of attack methods and accessories. Jonathan uses sub-weapons and get better if he uses them for long periods of time while Charlotte casts magic spells. You can switch between them at any time and they both share the same health and weapon energy bars. They also can be summoned at the same time to perform special attacks on enemies and bosses. There's a castle that needs to be explored again but now there are paintings scattered throughout with additional stages that your characters can jump into a la Mario in Super Mario 64. And just like in DoS, you can save your progress in any room marked in red on the map you see on the top screen of the DS. Beat the game and you unlock bonus content.The PROS: The game makes improvements in the graphics, music and sound effects so it looks better than Dawn of Sorrow. Using two characters at the same time brings more strategy to the table and it never feels like a chore switching between the two of them. They compliment each other and you'll need to switch between them to access certain areas. Using their simultaneous special attack feature helps deal with the tougher enemies and bosses further into the game. In addition to the main story, you have the option to complete side quests to earn money and extra items. On top of the same as before but nice anyway"" bonus content, there is some online connectivity now. You can open up a virtual shop and sell items you collected by connecting online with other players. Just like before when you and a friend can run through stages and see who finishes first, this time you can do the same thing online. The difficulty level here is more balanced out than it was in Dawn of Sorrow but will still give players a challenge regardless.The CONS: Setting up your own virtual shop to sell items is cool but it's only fun if there are people who connect online and from what I have seen, not many people connect online with this game. The same goes for the VS 2 player mode where you race another person through custom stages and see who can finish first. Both of these online features are nice but it would have been cool to play through the game with another person online or at least flesh out the custom stages. Other than the new story, characters, map and paintings, it's the same Castlevania experience you played before.Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin is really for the fans of the popular video game series. There is more variety now and the game is more catered to the DS as well. Those who don't like the direction the handheld Castlevania games has followed will not pay attention to this game. Everyone else should check it out and once again, it's a fun game that will keep you busy for awhile even if the experience is familiar.""",4,Better than Dawn of Sorrow,2011/8/16 0:00
A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000GIXIPK,"Cloud ...""""",3,2,"Notice I said like"" since Portrait of Ruin lately is one of those games where people play it and go ""it's not Dawn of Sorrow"". Well to be honest, I haven't actually played that one. The only real Castlevania I started playing was Lament of Innocence which even series fans didn't really care for. As a Christmas gift, I received this and finally started my first blown try at a Castlevania game and I actually did like it. While it does have a noticeable Metroid root (so dubbed by people Metroidvania), it's also quite enjoyable despite some minor but noticeable flaws.Story: With this series it's just like Mario only instead of saving the Princess we have to contend with another castle and baddie in a different time period. Taking him on during World War II era is Jonathan and his companion Charlotte. It doesn't really have huge twists but it's at least a good story to experience.Graphics: They almost feel GBA-quality and it isn't a knock against the game. The other game I asked for was Final Fantasy III which has some great 3D graphics. Portrait's graphics aren't really that stellar but they've been like this for awhile so it's hard to knock them. I like having the varied locations for the levels though. Levels are essentially portraits you enter with places like an old town or a desert.Sound/Music: The in-game sound effects are nice and fit the world but don't think they're going to impress since they're just meant to add realism to a fantastic world. The voice acting is minimal at times, relegated to sound bytes with the story told through text but the always dependable music doesn't disappoint either.Gameplay: An RPG format with levelling up and weapons and equipment found along the way. The problem is like a lot of RPG's you might find yourself overwhelmed but it's kind of inconsistent since you can dispatch enemies no problem but then there's a boss with a killer hit taking off a HUGE chunk of life, literally making it 2 hits and you die. Purchasing equipment is not really a problem except things can get pretty expensive but since by that time you need more Potions, Anti-Venom or Curse antidotes than you never really get to purchase that next armor since you're spending it on life-saving stuff.The game has a Dual-Character system where you can switch between action heavy Jonathan or book-wielding/spellcasting Charlotte. Again, it's inconsistent since you'll mainly use Jonathan since he hits harder. There's a couple of puzzles where you can call him/her to fight with you or solving a puzzle. An early example is having her stand on a statue and pushing it so you can access a higher path that's too high to jump. There's room for a lot of these but that's evident through the game.Of course it's not going to eclipse Symphony of the Night in fans' eyes or even Dawn of Sorrow but regardless it's a really enjoyable game that shows that even if it's familiar, they don't do wrong either...unless they're in 3D.""",5,My first foray into Castlevania and I liked it,2006/12/26 0:00

I'm glad I played it as a rental instead of shelling out $30 of good money for it.  The storyline is both nondescript and nonexistent, and the game plays straightforwardly.  The graphics, like other Castlevania games, is rather poor, little improved over the old GBA versions.

A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000GIXIPK,"Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...""",3,3,"Castlevania - Portrait of Ruin is a classic side-scrolling adventure pitting Jonathan and Charlotte against vampires, skeletons and other baddies.If you haven't played the other Castlevania games you might be a little lost going into this. They don't spend a lot of time on plot development or letting you know who is who. It really comes down to Jonathan Morris being the 'fighter' while Charlotte Aulin is the 'magic user'. You can have one or both of them on screen at any given time. Not only do they fight together as a team, but they can puzzle solve as well.For example, you can have one of them stand on a pedestal, and use the other one to push the pedestal along to a new ledge. There aren't tons of these puzzles, but enough to keep things interesting.The graphics are engaging enough to keep you interested without getting overly complicated. They do a good job portraying the skeletons and other monsters with the pixels they have available.One of the fun aspects of Castlevania games is the level design. Levels have multiple tiers to each area and you go up, down and around trying to figure out how to progress. It's a logic puzzle to figure out how to get past blocking obstructions.If you're addicted to three dimensions then this old-school fun might not be quite your cup of tea. However, there really is a simple elegance to a side scrolling adventure. It's a puzzle, how to navigate through the maze, how to use your pair of skills to overcome different types of enemies.Also, the music and sound is rather well done. It helps draw you into the atmosphere of the game.The game is super for what it offers. Monster-killing fun. Side-scrolling puzzles. A good team of characters.

AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000GIXIPK,"N. Durham Big Evil""""",9,8,"It's a safe bet that when Konami creates a Castlevania for a handheld that it's going to be pretty good.  Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin is no exception, and while it doesn't do much we haven't seen before in the series, it still manages to pack one heck of a punch.  Following up the wonderful Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin puts you in the shoes of Jonathan and Charlotte; a whip and magic wielding duo that you play as together throughout the game.  This new dynamic adds some spice to the tried but true side scrolling gameplay, which is rich with a horde of weapons, items, and power-ups to find.  And, since this is a Castlevania game, it's only natural that the boss battles are nothing short of fantastic and the best parts of the game.  The graphics look sharp with superb animation and effects that really show off what the DS is capable of with 2-D graphics.  The music and sound is superb as well, and the game offers some decent touch screen capabilities that are more substancial than the ones found in Dawn of Sorrow.  If there's any cons to Portrait of Ruin, it's that the level designs don't have that personality that we've seen in previous Castlevania games like Dawn of Sorrow and the GBA titles, but that's not a huge gripe.  All in all, Portrait of Ruin is another superb portable Castlevania game, and yet another must own title for the DS.",5,More Castlevania on the go?  Count me in,2006/12/17 0:00
A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000GIXIPK,S. Rhodes,7,6,"Last year, Konami released Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow for the Nintendo DS and it was a smash success.  It was one of the best DS games to come around.  Needless to say Portrait of Ruin has a lot to live up to.  It's just as good as Dawn of Sorrow, but it's no where near superior.  Still, it's a really fun game, and Castlevania fans can really enjoy what is destined to be another fantastic 2D side scroller.Portrait of Ruin takes place in the year 1944, in the middle of World War II.  However, the problem isn't the war, but rather that Castlevania has appeared again.  Only this time, a vampire artist named Brauner is controlling the power of the castle with paintings.  As Johnathan Morris and his friend Charlotte Orlean, your job will be to destroy these paintings as well as Brauner and any followers he may have.The game begins with you entering Castlevania, and you're able to explore the castle as you like in the metroid style way that's been around since Symphany of the Night, and the exploration is complete with warps and hidden walls.  However, in exploring, there's a twist this time.  As you roam through the castle, you'll come across paintings.  When you do come across a painting, it's your job to jump inside and go through the particular area it takes you to.  This new aspect is fun simply for the fact that it means there is more exploration to be done in this Castlevania than previous entries.  Not only must you explore the castle, but several different paintings as well.  This really adds a lot of variety to the setting.  The first painting is a city, for example, and you'll soon find yourself exploring the desert as well as other areas.The games environments look spectacular.  More detail is given to the backgrounds this time around, some effects being rendered in 3D.  They look pretty cool.  The game sports quite a bit of detail.  Some of the enemies look really good too.  There are over 100 enemies in Portrait of Ruin and some of them look absolutely stunning, especially some of the bosses you'll be fighting.  Needless to say, you won't tire of looking at the game any time soon.Portrait of Ruin doesn't use the touch screen for much of anything, though.  Gameplay happens on the touch screen but unlike Dawn of Sorrow, you'll never have to use your stylus, and that's fine with me.  The map is also displayed on the top screen at all times, much like it was in Dawn of Sorrow.  This means no more toggling between the map and gameplay.An interesting tweak to the gameplay is that you are now in control of two characters as opposed to one.  Johnathan and Charlotte.  Both characters are not the same, however, so don't expect that you'll never change.  Johnathan uses a whip and can use sub weapons such as knives while Charolotte specializes in several different types of magic.  As you progress through the game you'll run into a variety of enemies, some of which can only be killed with a specific character.You can switch characters at any time, but you can also call your partner into battle for some assisstance.  The AI will control whichever character you are not controlling.  Also, when you call on your partner, the MP guage will become their life guage.  If they take too much damage they'll be dismissed.  The good news, however, is that your MP refills as you walk around so even if they're taken out it won't be long before you can call on them again.The game is filled with puzzles to progress further, and you will indeed need both characters to go about some of them.  Again, this is unique to the Castlevania experience.  Early in the game, for example, you'll need to have one character stand on top of a statue while the other pushes, and you'll have to switch between them to get it going.Another welcome addition to the gameplay are quests.  Early in the game you'll meet a character named Wind who will send you on quests.  These quests are optional, but doing them nets you rewards such as new techniques or rare items.  There's also a merchant for you to buy goods from.Co-op play is another welcome addition to the game but it's extremely limited.  You can play either with a friend or with anyone from around the world, but you can't go through the main adventure, which is honestly a real drag.  The only thing you can do in co-op mode is fight all the bosses.  It's a boss rush mode with two players... that's it.  It's very disappointing that multiplayer is simply that.  Even worse, you both share a life guage, so if your partner dies, you suffer just as much.  You can find people through Nintendo Wi-Fi, which is really nice.  You can connect with anyone or you can enter a friend code, either way it doesn't matter.Its unfortunate that Boss Rush mode isn't a whole lot of fun, though.  You get rewarded for completing it at least.  However, it would've been far better (and more fun) to go through the adventure mode with a friend.  Instead your limited to boss rush mode.Shopping through the wi-fi network isn't bad, though.  When you connect to Nintendo Wi-Fi you select a monster and then the wi-fi connection seeks out a shop for you.  When you go in, you'll be able to buy items from people.  Likewise, you could set up the wi-fi and then sell items as well.When selling items, however, one has to note that you do not get to choose what price you sell stuff for.  You can only sell it for the price that you could sell it to a normal merchant for.  This means that you can't find a really rare item, and then sell it to your best friend for one cent.  However, to the shopping's credit, if you decide to open up a store and someone buys from you, the item does not disappear from your inventory.  So if you have a really powerful weapon, and your friend buys it, you both can use it.  It's a fun way to find rare items, however the shop your given is completely random (if you decide not to go into a friend's shop).  So there's no guarantee you'll get a good one the first time.Castlevania is known for having some of the best music in gaming.  Portrait of Ruin is no exception.  While it isn't as good as Dawn of Sorrow, it still has a lot of flare and passion that will absorb you.  Many tunes are indeed memorable.

A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B000GPVUQ2,blackaciddevil,3,1,"Introduced to Mortal Kombat with Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and having played all the games in the franchise(including MK Mythologies:Sub-Zero and MK Special Forces); I've seen the series have its' ups and downs. Like every franchise that has spawned many sequels, there've been moments of greatness and moments when you're left thinking What were they thinking?"". While Mortal Kombat Armageddon won't leave thinking the latter, Armageddon isn't a moment of greatness either. With a roster of over 58 characters as well as a good number of fighting arenas spanning the entire Mortal Kombat history- think of Armageddon as a 'Best-of' if you will or, at the very least, a second Mortal Kombat Trilogy as pointed out by another reviewer. I'll admit; it's good to see some of my old favorite like Rain-Ermac-Fujin-Smoke and being able to play them in the Deadly Alliance/Deception vein. That, first and foremost, was worth plunking down the asking price for the game. That and the new stuff included in the game such as Motor Kombat, the kreate-a-fighter/kreate-a-fatality modes and the revamped Mortal Kombat Konquest mode(done quite like Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks). Yet, what chaps my hide is the fact that Boon and company decided to recycle alot of the animations from previous games and put them in this game. Come on, if you're going to give us a 'Best-of' game of sorts...give us some new animations to look at during the match, for chrissakes. Instead of seeing Scorpion spear the camera and pull it to him for the umpteenth time, you know?? Too, Wassup with this Kata thing at the end of the Kombat mode?? If you can look pass it's faults, though, Mortal Kombat Armageddon is a good game to end the series on the current-generation consoles with.After seeing screenshots of several next-generation games, I'm anxious to see what direction Midway takes with the next Mortal Kombat game. Hopefully, it will be a more realistic approach. It would also be nice to see them take the Mortal Kombat mythos into new genres(MMORPG?).""",4,Mortal Kombat Armageddon.......,2006/10/24 0:00
ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B000GPVUQ2,Micheal Hunt,0,0,"Going from Shoalin Monks"" to ""Deception"" left a bad taste in my mouth, but I suppose I should have played the games in order, as Deception probably is a no brainier would not be as good as Shoalin Monks.  However, with that said, I did write in my review about Deception that I thought it was an absolutely stupid idea in Konquest Mode to be playing as an unknown character, especially since he starts off as a child, and you have to do errand's for the townsfolk, like collecting water and finding lost puppies etc... WTF? So I was a bit skeptic when I found out that Konquest mode in this version here had the same thing.However, Midway listened to the complaints from the previous game (Deception) and even tho they kept it as an unknown character, at least this character was an adult, and easy to get used to. He is the son of a sorcerer and elder god, whom he and his brother where frozen in stone to be awoken when Mortal Kombat needed them to prevent Armageddon. He finds out his brother was somehow resurrected by mistake many years before he was, and it has warped his mind to become evil. Your quest it to play as Tavern and do the things Konquest is known for, like running around collecting coins and treasures etc to unlock bonus content or create a fighter parts... but you also engage in one on one kombat against bosses... giving you the adventure feel as well as classic MK style kombat.It does not take all that long to complete Konquest mode. I did it in a few days, but if I had more time to kill, it might be possible to complete it in a few hours. The only thing I found a little disappointing about it was a few of the sub bosses are a lot harder than the actual big bosses of the game. Scorpion's Klan seemed to be the hardest to beat, but that is the second last or 3rd last battle of the game... then I got to the final fight and thought ""is that it?"" I don't get to battle such and such?"" but then I guess, this is a sub-story of Mortal Kombat, kind of like ""Shadows of The Empire"" where you are playing as a character you didn't see in any of the Star Wars films, but none-the-less, this game made a great side-story to the Mortal Kombat realms.Also in the game is Arcade mode. Much like Mortal Kombat 4, only much, much, much better. It contains just about every character from the Mortal Kombat history in this game, so it's kind of like a Trilogy, or Quad-trilogy, even tho some of the characters do not appear anywhere in Konquest Mode, but who cares, they haven't been left out!The Kombatants you can select are all your classic favorites, non favorites and a few that unless you played other side games, you may not be familiar with yet:- Ashra - Barak- Bo Rai Cho- Chameleon- Cyrax- Dairuo- Darrious- Drahmin- Ermac- Frost- Fujin- Goro- Havik- Hatoru- Hsu Hao- Jade- Jarek- Jax- Johnny Cage- Kabal- Kai- Kano- Kenshi- Kintaro- Kira- Kitana- Kobra- Kung Lao- Kurtis Stryker- Li Mei- Lui Kang - Mavado- Meat- Mileena- MoKap- Moloch- Montaro- Night Wolf- Nitara- Noob Saibot- Unaga- Quan Chi- Raiden- Rain- Reiko- Reptile- Sareena- Scorpion- Sektor- Shang T-Sung- Shoa Khan- Sheeva- Shinnok- Shujinko- Sindel- Smoke- Sonya Blade- Subzero- Tanya and a few to unlock- Blaze- Tavern- Meat- DeagonOff the top of my head right now, I can't recall anyone else from the video game series of MK that they have left out. Everyone from MK1 to MK4 seems to be here, including sub games like Mythologies and other titles.The only thing that I'm not all that impressed with is the new fatality system. Pretty much everyone has the same thing, a combination of moves you can do for fatalities, but none seem to be specific to a character. So good by Sub Zero's head rip, bye-bye Scorpions flaming skull toasty fire... had they only included those this game would get a flawless victory.Also included is Motor Kombat. Much like Mario Kart! I kid you not! You can select a few of the Mortal Kombatants and their vehicles, and go racing. It's a very simple racing style with special moves and powerups to collect along the way, but it does not require any skid turns, so it's not as advanced as Mario Kart, but none-the-less, it's not a bad bonus game!Everything else included is unlock-able kontent like videos, stages, alternate costumes and what not. Completing the game and finding the 60 artifacts along the way will unlock it all, or you can purchase them with the koins you collect.Now, the best thing about this game is FINALLY, there is a Kreate a Kombant mode! You can now finally create your own character, and I must say, Midway have outdone themselves with the choices you have to create with. You can make pretty much whomever you like, especially from the Street Fighter games, and you will get a pretty close enough looking character to what they look like. You can also select your moves, special moves, taunts and what not.This is by far been one of the best Mortal Kombats I have ever played. I like Shaolin Monks story mode better, but this one here is by far better in everything else. Sure, you can pick a few plot-holes in the story, but who cares, at the end of the day, when everything is said and done, would I still load this game up to play again? Hell yes!

AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000GPVUQ2,"N. Durham Big Evil""""",6,4,"Reportedly the final Mortal Kombat game (I'll believe that when I see it), Mortal Kombat: Armageddon rounds up every single fighter that has appeared in the past six MK games.  That's right, there's over sixty fighters present in Armageddon, which is reason enough for long time MK fighters to pick this up.  Every fighter, from fan favorites like Johnny Cage, Raiden, Kitana, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Kano, and a zombified Liu Kang, to obscure fighters like Kai, Stryker, Chameleon, Mokap, and Jarek, to old bosses like Shao Khan, Goro, Kintaro, and Motaro; all of whom are brought together to do battle and fight to take on demonic final boss Blaze.  Those who have had avid experience on Deadly Alliance and Deception will feel right at home here and be able to get right into the game, mainly because nothing has changed.  The graphics are still the same (although by now they are dated) and the gameplay is virtually the same as well.  The only real changes to the gameplay is that every fighter now only has one fighting style and a weapon based style now, instead of having two different styles and a weapon style.  Now, it's understandable that perhaps there wasn't enough room or time to implement every single fighting style into the game, but this is a bit of a disappointment.  Not to mention that the individual fatalities for each character are gone, replaced with the Kreate-A-Fatality feature, which is pretty much a method for saving space on the game disc.  This is Armageddon's most disappointing aspect, and does hurt the overall rating.  Also, for being a final boss, Blaze isn't that hard to beat.  Sometimes he can be frustrating, but he isn't that hard to put down like Shao Khan or even Onaga (who is also here) before him.  Konquest Mode is back, and it's better than ever here, having become a full fledged third person adventure.  The Krypt is back as well, and finally only runs on one Kurency to unlock extras, and the online features are back as well and just as good as they were on Deception.  There's also a new mode called Motor Kombat, which is basically a bloody version of Mario Kart with Raiden, Cage, Baraka, Kitana, Mileena, Baraka, Cyrax, Jax, Scorpion, and Sub-Zero racing each other, with mixed results.  All in all, despite the negative press that this game has received, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon is still a fun fighter that delivers the goods, and is a fitting send-off for the long running and influential series.",4,Final Kombat,2006/11/22 0:00

I bought my copy from Game Crazy 2 days ago (release day) and it's amazing! Don't let the stupid bad reviews hinder you from getting this! Everything is great about this. The Konquest mode is very entertaining and challenging and fun! You can unlock things from the Krypt in Konquest, find currency, and more! You can now fight people in the actuall game a la Shaolin Monks. It's not as deep as SM but it's very simple and fun. The Krpyt now only contains about 300 items or so and the game only uses one type of currency instead of many. The Krypt even tells you what's inside each lock which is nice.This sports 60 characters and 4 are unlockable when you collect a certain amount of relic items in Konquest. There are 2 fighting styles but be glad for this. It makes the game faster and a bit more fun. The aerial combat is awesome and super fast and flashy. The Kreat-a-Fatality system is VERY fun and rewarding yet is very deep. There are set moves you have to do such as Forward Chains then there are Transitions like putting the oppenent on his knees then finishers for that or transitions from that. Each part is a certain combo, and bosses have their own sets. You also have sword combos but only characters with long single bladed swords can do this. Check GameFaqs for a full list of these combos.Lastly, Kreate-a-Fighter is VERY fun and deep and is just so customizable. You can even type up a biography! Motor Kombat is a bit of a let down. The tracks are very short and after a few races it gets boring but it's better with human oppenents.

A2582KMXLK2P06,B000HE7KZC,B. E Jackson,1,1,"First let's mention the not so pleasant news- Yoshi's Island DS is unfortunately nowhere near as good as the original Super NES Yoshi's Island.  THAT game is now considered a legendary game in Nintendo's long and rich history of gaming spanning over 30 years (and rightfully so).  The good news?  What made the original Yoshi's Island so memorable is *almost* up to par in this DS version.While my biggest complaint with the just-released Yoshi's New Island was the generic straightforward level design that does nothing the original Yoshi's Island hasn't already done significantly better, Yoshi's Island DS may go a tad overboard with the exploration while frequently making you feel lost while surrounded with bland level design.  The level design is less than stellar truthfully despite how much fun it might be to stomp and flutter your way through the many enemy-populated levels that make up most of the game.  I'm afraid I do sometimes get bored with the floating high in the air levels while riding the princess in particular.  These type of levels seem to feel nonsensical much too often.Most of the levels are rather simplistic and designed in a way that encourages gamers to speed along as quickly as possible.  Just running forward to the finish line is probably going to be on most peoples agenda since the game encourages you to do so.  Oh sure you still have the option of collecting coins, flowers and stars to 100% complete levels if you want to soak in everything the game has to offer, but it's now significantly easier and lazier this time with a clear emphasis on speeding through the stages due to standard design and easy to tackle baddies.  Nintendo should have worked on the game harder to fix this obvious shortcoming.If you've read that Yoshi's Island DS has the same levels as the ones in the Super NES's Yoshi's Island, well I honestly don't know where people are getting their information or why they come up with such blatant lies but that's flat out *wrong!*  These levels are completely different from the ones in the Super NES's Yoshi's Island.  Oh sure they obviously *try* to imitate the ones in the original Yoshi's Island WAY too many times, sometimes even stretching out similar ideas much too often like skiing and boulder pushing to name two examples- skiing was fun in World 5 in Yoshi's Island but now they take the same concept and repeat it a couple more times.  Same way with pushing boulders.  BUT!  These not the same stages as the ones from the original Yoshi's Island.  Let that be perfectly known.Now Yoshi can awkwardly swing on vines!  He brought along some baby friends on his journey.  The princess can float on an umbrella while riding Yoshi to newer and higher locations.  Donkey Kong can ride Yoshi as well, and swing across a separate type of vines.  You can ride a giant bouncing kangaroo which just screams children's game.  Wario is featured here and he has a magnet to draw in the coins.  Baby Bowser can shoot fireballs while riding Yoshi which is somewhat fun truth be told.  These are very trivial additions ultimately that do nothing to enhance the original version in the slightest.  These are only featured to add a little bit of unnecessary diversity.  You'll still wish you were playing as baby Mario on Yoshi's back instead the entire time (which is what you'll be doing most of the time anyway so it's not really a big deal).  Honestly Nintendo should have just left it with baby Mario and never brought in all these other characters.  But having them there isn't *that* much of an issue.The music is deplorable.  While I was quick to defend the soundtrack to Yoshi's New Island and I certainly believe the soundtrack to that game is underrated compared to the strong backlash it's been getting so far, unfortunately I can't do the same with the barely distinguishable notes that make up Yoshi's Island DS.  Simplistic, lullaby-inspired songs throughout the game, or weak hallow imitations of the themes from the original Yoshi's Island.  Boss fights are significantly worse too.  They're tame, uninteresting and easy to complete.  The game lacks challenge overall.  You can just speedrun through the game basically.I think the game has way too many auto-scrolling stages.  However on a couple occasions, such as level 5-1, this very well could be one of the most creative and exciting scrolling stages in the history of Mario.  I LOVE this level.  Also expect a bunch of maze-like levels to pop up often.  Remember that bonus stage in World 4 with the big maze in the sewers?  Well Yoshi's Island DS has a few just like that particular level, but inside caves.  I really hate how straightforward, unthreatening and unchallenging the castle levels are in this game.  They're *exceptionally* mediocre.  That's probably my biggest complaint.  For some reason Nintendo didn't work on the castles thoroughly enough so they feel underwhelming the way they are now.  Again the boss fights really stink.  The gigantic shy guy on stilts is painfully easy.  It is however, not uncommon to take a cheap shot from bosses and messing up your perfect 100% score.The balloon-popping or coin-collecting mini games you played (and probably enjoyed) with the bandits on your Super NES version of Yoshi's Island have now been replaced with less interesting games such as destroying shy guys, fluttering Yoshi as far as possible or riding a rocket around planets to collect coins.  The vehicle transformations that made the original Yoshi's Island distinctive are used significantly less here.  MUCH less.  However emphasis on actual platforming has increased.Yoshi's super annoying and dreadful howling basset hound fluttering chalkboard-scratching noises have returned much to my displeasure, and Mario sounds exceptionally cranky and cries faster and louder than he did in the first Yoshi's Island game.  These are two minor but ultimately unlikeable aspects of the game.However!  We can't ignore that the amount of content here is pretty extraordinary for only 5 worlds. Yes that's right, 5 worlds instead of 6 like in the original Yoshi's Island.  But now each world has TWO bonus stages!  When you add it up, you're basically getting almost as many levels as the first Yoshi's Island.  And the levels in Yoshi's Island DS have this way of feeling much bigger than they really are too.  The bad news is that the bonus stages are basically played out like regular stages in both level design and challenge.  This is slightly disappointing.  The bonus stages in the original Yoshi's Island were unique and went the extra mile to give us something we haven't seen before.However at the end of the day, we have to remember something very very important.  For those people who've never played Yoshi's Island on their Super NES, they'd have no idea that game is actually better overall.  If you take Yoshi's Island DS for what it is -which is why I'm giving the game a 4-star rating- we can't ignore that this game is flat out *fun* to play despite the many tiny noticeable flaws.  If we ignore all comparisons to the original Yoshi's Island, this game stands on its own pretty well.  Besides, due to Yoshi's Island being in a unique category of platformers, I'm more than happy to give this game a free pass.  An imitation is still passable when it's executed properly and this one is for the most part.  Oh and let's not forget the new enemies you'll encounter such as big bouncing chain chomp heads (VERY scary!), fire-spewing shy guys and hopping brown toads.It's amazing that after 20 years since the original Yoshi's Island release Nintendo STILL can't make a game anywhere as good, but Yoshi's Island DS is a nice attempt at giving us more of the same even if the game feels watered down in comparison.  Yoshi's Story was probably the closest in quality even though it was several notches down in terms of pure entertainment in comparison to the original Yoshi's Island.  Yoshi's Island DS suffers from bland and uninspiring level design with only so-so graphics and awful music that leaves me with this final message- pick up this game anyway.  Avoid Yoshi's New Island however.  Straightforward level design completely ruined THAT game.  Pick up the Super NES version of Yoshi's Island and it will be the best decision you've made in a while.",4,"nothing like the first yoshi's island, but a quality attempt",2014/4/23 0:00

Although the PSP has been more about gloss and the ability to play movies, the DS has brought out much more excitement in the video games. That has definitely happened with the Mario franchise too for DS owners. With the success of New Super Mario Brothers last year, die hard gamers really wanted a return for their cute dinosaur friend Yoshi too. Unfortunately, Yoshi was out of the picture. Nevertheless, die hard fans have waited over a year to see Mario's friend return in another great classic. This time, it is on his own.Yoshi's Island DS return the classic feeling of Yoshi and his baby companions Mario, Donkey Kong, Peach and Wario, as they help Yoshi and his pals try to rescue Baby Luigi from the clutches of Bowser and his minions. The graphics are absolutely amazing, and bring back the feeling of what the game originally brought out from the Super NES era, and again on the Game Boy Advance. There are over 60 levels of platforming action that are absolutely amazing, and really challenge you at times as you work your way during the game. Yoshi also has to battle enemies like he always does by swallowing villains and turning them into eggs, or by stomping and pounding them to the ground. The gameplay is absolutely addictive, and brings out a great deal of challenge. There is one disadvantage, the music is cute, but at times can be a bit tiring. Still, it doesn't interupt the challenge of the game. Along the way, Yoshi and the gang also earn 1-ups, as well as minigames to unlock from a concentration card match, to roulette, and a flutter jump contest.All in all, Yoshi's Island DS is a delightful game for any Nintendo DS owner, and longtime fan of the Mario games.

Anyone familiar with Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island will be immediately drawn to Yoshi's Island DS, which improves on it's Super NES and GBA predecessor in many ways.  Using both of the screens to play, you once again control Yoshi as you have a baby on your back.

The game's look and feel is pretty much the exact of the original Yoshi's Island, which is a good thing.  There's an incredible amount of bonuses to unlock, but the game is so easy to get into and pick up and play that you'll be making progress in no time.  If there's any complaint to make about Yoshi's Island DS, it's that there is a somewhat steep learning curve as you progress through the game.  Some multiplayer options would have been nice too, but with the game being this good, that is forgiveable.

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000HE7KZC,S. Rhodes,87,76,"Over a decade ago, Yoshi's Island on the Super Nintendo was a blast that at the time took the gaming world by storm.  It didn't quite have the same impact when it was released for the GBA in 2002, but it still managed to sport some of its originality.  We finally get a sequel, and its actually pretty good.  It keeps all the good stuff from the previous game and adds in some new quirks.  So it isn't exactly the same game.  There are indeed some key differences.In the first Yoshi's Island, Kamek kidnapped Baby Luigi while Baby Mario fell to Yoshi's Island.  The Yoshi's rallied together to reunite Mario with his brother.  The adventure was long, satisfying and quite a challenge.  In the sequel on DS, Kamek is up to his dirty tricks again, but the key difference is that now the Yoshi's are taking care of more than one baby.A lot of gameplay mechanics from the first one return.  As you go through levels Yoshi does pretty much all that he did in the first one.  That is to say you can jump and hover briefly, ground pound, make enemies into eggs and throw those eggs, as well as spitting your enemies back out at others.  In this aspect Yoshi's Island has not changed at all.  In addition to all this, keeping track of the baby on your back is also the same.  If Yoshi ever touches an enemy he'll lose the baby off his back and a timer starts to countdown.  You have to recover the baby before the timer runs out or else you lose a life.  Also like in the first one, stars refill the counter.There's more that returns.  The completion of the game is a spot on match to the first one.  As you go through levels you'll see flowers, red coins among the normal ones, and stars that need collecting.  Upon completing a level you'll be given a score out of 100.  The only way to get 100 is if you collect all the flowers, red coins, and manage to keep your counter completely full by collecting stars.  There are always 100 points, and if you manage to score 100 points in every level of a world, you'll unlock a bonus stage... just like in the original.There is one difference in the gameplay in particular that separates Yoshi's Island DS from the original Super Nintendo version.  The fact that there is more than one baby that Yoshi can carry on his back.  At first this doesn't sound like much, but it makes a difference in some of Yoshi's abilities.  You'll begin the game with Baby Mario and Baby Peach.  As you progress however, you'll get more babies--DK, Wario and Boswer.  They each allow you to do something different.  Mario, for example, let's Yoshi dash while Peach has a parasol. In the end, if you actually want to do everything Yoshi's Island has to offer, you'll have to use all the babies.  Some levels cannot be completed unless you've got the right baby to do it.  So if you're having trouble getting some items, or you can't access a certain part of the level, it might be because you're not using the right baby.The best part about Yoshi's Island is that the game as a whole is a challenge.  More so than the original.  The mechanic of having to switch babies to progress through levels adds a lot of variety to the levels.  Having to score 100 points on every level also adds a lot of variety and challenge.  Yoshi's Island DS is also fun to play because it doesn't do away with the mechanics that made the first one so good.  The boss fights are just as memorable here as they were in the SNES installment.Its the graphics where Yoshi's Island DS misses a little bit.  In all honesty, it doesn't look all that different from the first one on the Super Nintendo.  This isn't bad seeing as how the art style is still unique, but it doesn't look that much better than the game we got over ten years ago.  It's pretty and all, but if you played the first one to death, you're not really seeing anything new.  Most of the enemies look the same as they did before.  Along those lines, the game doesn't sound as good as the SNES original.  Most of it is actually quite forgettable.  The tunes aren't bad or anything.  They're just not catchy.The game also doesn't use the touch screen.  All the top screen is used for is so that you can see more of the level.  So if you were expecting it to take full advantage of the DS's capabilities, you'll be disappointed.  This in no way detracts from the game's value, though.In the end, Yoshi's Island DS isn't so bad.

Well, thankfully, I did have a little break in there by playing Scurge: Hive & it was enough for me to recharge my batteries and get ready to play part 5. While I'll admit, it isn't my most favorite Final Fantasy...it is, however, the best Final Fantasy game I've played. No wonder it's the one Final Fantasy that alot of future FF games were based upon gameplay conceptwise. The game holds up very well by todays' standards. It's definitely worth adding to the collection.The story is something like this....When the wind crystal suddenly shatters and causes the wind in the world to simply stop, Princess Lenna sets off to discover exactly what happened. It's not long before she's joined in her quest by Bartz, Galuf, and Faris.

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000HE9LEK,"Cloud ...""""",5,3,"I first played Final Fantasy V when it was released with VI with Anthology for the Playstation. Being one of the few installments that didn't get a stateside release (along with III which is here on the DS), a lot of people loved playing V mainly for the gameplay since storywise they're just wasn't anything there. While it does feel like they're releasing the games over and over for money, most can't even find the original Anthology release anyway so we have V being released separately which is a good game in its own right but it might not be as well-rounded as VI or the later installments.Story: Same ol' really but here it goes: King Tycoon is off to the Wind Shrine to check on the Wind crystal which he fears is in danger. Princess Lenna follows him only to be blocked by a massive meteor that hits the ground. Meeting traveller Bartz as well as Galuf, an old man with amnesia, the 3 travel to the Wind Shrine and with the help of Faris the pirate, have to save the world and protect the crystals from evil.Graphics: Nothing that stellar really but this is a Gameboy Advance title so it's easier to forgive. The graphics look more cleaner but don't expect major overhauls to the graphics to make them more advanced or impressive, they're just more...polished. Character portraits as always have Amano's artwork which is always a welcome though it's kind of odd, but not distracting, to have characters with certain features like Faris' grey hair in portrait to have purple hair in game. But it's always been like that so whatever.Sound/Music: V's soundtrack is sandwiched inbetween IV and VI, the latter being arguably his finest soundtrack. V's is also impressive with memorable tunes and melodies and some well-known ones like Dear Friends or Battle on the Big Bridge but on the other hand, other tracks are just iffy. They're nice and all but there was never a moment during IV or VI where a bad song suddenly showed up when you entered a new area but in V it's more like it's good music then all of a sudden hey, this theme's cool"".Gameplay: Unlike IV and VI which had specific classes, in V you can be anybody and the fun comes from mix and matching. Instead of only bringing out certain characters because they're more useful in battle, you can customize your character however you want. Sure you can be a Thief and rob enemies but what if you want to Cure as well? No problem: just learn White Magic, be a Thief and put White Magic in ability menu and poof, now you can nab helpful stuff along with curing your party. Some classes are incredibly useful and even fun to use while others are just quirky and you'd probably only use them for completion purposes.The Anthology release was fun though frustrating to play since levelling up was kind of a must with many times needing to level up your characters in order to not get slaughtered and the GBA one is just as tough though it's slightly more lenient let's say. Just toughen up your characters and you'll be fine. Also, there's not a lot story wise to the game since it's basically crystals in trouble, warriors come together to stop evil with a touch of character development now and then (i.e: characters waking up in the middle of the night to have a monologue). It's not the most deepest RPG storywise and aside from Lenna and maybe Faris, the characters are not as endearing as a Rydia or Kain.I'd recommend V since it's an addicting game to master Job classes though for a more well-rounded game with story and characters, seek VI out but when you're finished with that, by all means give V a go.""",4,4.5; Got lots of free time?,2008/2/9 0:00
AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000HE9LEK,"N. Durham Big Evil""""",2,2,"Over the past couple years, Square has been releasing ports of their beloved older Final Fantasy games to the GBA, with results ranging from great to excellent.  Final Fantasy V Advance is no different, once again offering superb and classic RPG action that does the GBA proud.  If you remember the Final Fantasy Anthology that was released for the PS1 years back, you'll remember this game, and when playing it on the GBA, you'll notice a few slight differences, most notably in the game's story and dialogue.  The graphics look like you would expect a 16-bit Final Fantasy game to look like, with fluid animations and environments to boot.  The lengthy quest is quite challenging as well, offering up a great amount of replay value which help you get your money's worth with this game.  If there's any downsides to Final Fantasy V Advance, it's the typical kind you'd expect from the older games in the series: the horde of random battles that you'll across will grate on your nerves, and newer RPG players probably won't dig the dated presentation.  Not to mention that for a Final Fantasy game, the game's story doesn't grab you and make you want to keep playing just to find out what happens next.  Despite all that, Final Fantasy V Advance is another wonderful port of the classic series to Nintendo's undying handheld system, and the better news is that the best game in the series, Final Fantasy VI, is on the way to the GBA too.",5,Square once again strikes GBA gold,2007/1/9 0:00
A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000HE9LEK,S. Rhodes,16,14,"The first time Final Fantasy V was releasd in America was with the Final Fantasy Anthology package.  Now the game is where it belongs.  On a handheld system.  The GBA is pretty much at the end of its life, but it still manages to get a satisfactory game every now and then.  Final Fantasy V is by no means the best in the series, but it is, for the most part, an RPG that deserves appreciation and acclaim.Final Fantasy V begins with a character named Bartz witnessing a meteorite come hurdling to the ground.  When he goes to investigate he meets up with Lenna.  Lenna is searching for her father who has gone off to the wind shrine to check on the wind crystal.  Lately, the wind has been weak, and it can only be because something is wrong with the wind crystal.  In addition to meeting Lenna, Bartz also meets Galuf, a man who has lost his memory in light of the meteorite crashing.  All he can remember is his name, and that he too must also go to the wind shrine.  Eventually Bartz decides to travel with them, and so your adventure begins.In truth, Final Fantasy V doesn't have a good storyline... at least when compared to Final Fantasy IV and all the Final Fantasy games that appeared after the fifth installment.  It's pretty basic and generic.  This is obvious by how fast you'll meet your main party, and how much more emphasis is put on gameplay.  These characters are not well developed nor is the story full of unbelievable plot twists.  Except Final Fantasy V was not meant to be about storyline.  It's all about the gameplay, and that's where Final Fantasy V excels the most.As with Final Fantasy IV before it, Final Fantasy V uses the ATB battle system.  All your characters stand on one side of the screen while all the enemies stand on the other.  When a character's ATB gauge fills up, you'll be able to issue commands.  The game then plays out in turn based fashion.  Final Fantasy V is simple, yet it's a lot of fun, and it also provides a challenge.  The gameplay is enhanced even more by the games complex job system.The job system is extremely complex, even by todays standards.  As you progress through the game you'll obtain job classes for your characters.  There are plenty of jobs.  Monks, thieves, white mages, black mages, and plenty more.  Each of them learn several different abilities all of which can and will be useful to you on your journey.  When you select a job with a certain character, you'll have to battle to earn ability points so that they can learn all the abilities they can.  Some abilities are more useful than others, and the possibilities are endless.  Also, once a character learns an ability, you can change jobs and have them equip it.  So a black mage could, in fact, use white magic, provided he's learned the ability to do it.You'll spend a lot of time on the field battling to get ability points.  The more abilities you learn, the more ability points you'll need for the next.  This is fine and all, but most enemies don't give up loads of ability points.  So the game puts a huge emphasis on battling.  This is also seen by the low amounts of experience enemies also give off.  Leveling up is a slow process.  The good news is battling is fun, especially with the job system in place.  Unless everyone's jobs are the same, there's a nearly endless possibility of commands you can give in the middle of battle.Final Fantasy V Advance sports the same extras as all the previous Final Fantasy re-releases on the GBA do.  An extra dungeons and some extra bosses, and that's about it.  Nothing too big, but worth the price nonetheless.  It'll probably take you 20-30 hours to complete Final Fantasy V.  It's not filled to the brim with secrets like future Final Fantasy titles, but mastering all the jobs will really keep you busy for several hours alone.  It's also cool because along with the extra dungeons and bosses, you'll get four new job classes.  This only adds more to the already complex gameplay.Graphically, Final Fantasy V is a little dated, even by GBA standards.  It looks far better than it did in Final Fantasy Anthology.  It's much smoother and does have a little bit of an update, but it doesn't go the extra mile it could've.  Enemies still only flash to attack your characters, and they're hardly animated.  At least the game has a great soundtrack.  Final Fantasy V goes on to show why the Super Nintendo era for Final Fantasy music was one of the best in the series.  The game just sounds really good.Final Fantasy V is a golden treat for Final Fantasy fans.  It may have a weak storyline, but what it lacks in story it more than makes up for in gameplay.  It's not the best in the series, but it's still a really fun game.The Good+It's a lot of fun to play+The job system makes for a lot of variety in your party+Great music+The minor graphic updates are welcome+Bonus dungeons and bosses+There's a huge emphasis on gameplayThe Bad-Not enough of a graphical update-Weak story and characters",4,Not the Best in the Series but Still Good,2006/11/6 0:00

BADER Q8  AL BADER""""",4,4,"The graphics, the storyline, Niko, Packie, the in-game internet, the Infernus, THE GAMEPLAY!!!!That's pretty much what I love best about GTAIV, but almost everything is perfect. There is so much to do in this game. Even if you beat it, you still want to play it again and take the different paths laid out in the game... My favorite additions, (apart from non-cartoon vehicle handling and the amazing graphics) are the ability to hang out with friends, hide behind stuff, the ability to switch targets (You supposedly could in San Andreas, but I can't seem to), and the variety in cars, pedestrians, and missions.Rockstar has done it again, wowing us (or at least me) with a new masterpiece that push expectations of what the perfect video game should be. So far, in my book, Grand Theft Auto IV has that title. The characters are hilarious, and many times, have a story behind them.If there were anything I could change about this game, It would be the monochromatic environment. By that I mean, unlike San Andreas, there is, for the most part, only one terrain type, and that is city. Not that I don't love Liberty City, or that I believe a console is capable of having graphics as amazing as in GTA4 and at the same time having a massive environment, it's just that f you can't find anything to do (which is pretty hard) the game can feel stale. If there could ever be a game as graphically...amazing.... as GTA4, have the variety in vehicles, peds, and missions, and the same increcible gameplay, yet have the same massive and varied environment as San Andreas, that game would most likely win the best game of all time.So apart from the lack of terrain variety, and the strange appearances of vehicles of the same kind you are driving parked on the side of the road, This game is PERFECT.",5,A true masterpiece by Rockstar.,2009/3/14 0:00
A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B000HKP88C,"Christopher Barrett Evil Corgi""""",5,4,"I purchased the game and have played through a good portion of it so far.  My first compliment is the details that have been added.  It makes you really feel like you are part of the action.Okay my beefs:Controls.  They went and changed the control configuration; yes they added an option to revert to the classic style but...You cannot easily look behind you anymore using classic controls.  Gun targeting and aiming is horrible.  You can take auto target off, but then you spend a few precious seconds trying to find the target.  With auto target on, it is very tricky trying to manual aim; it keeps locking on to every other thing...and there is little help to correct this.Also of irritation is the fact that you fly through the windshield every time you get in a serious collision.  Ever heard of seatbelts?Plus: the motorcycle handling has been seriously lowered.  I used to speed about in bikes, but there is no serious cornering, even on the previously excellent PCJ 600.The missions are rather dull at first and repetitive.  The story is watered down as well.  In previous versions, everything started with a bang: in this it starts off with a leisurly drive...I would have preferred GTA Vice City's excellent story and missions with GTA San Andreas' excellent range and side missions.  I only hope that the next version might go back towards the perfection that was Vice City.Despite all these issues the game is incredibly enjoyable.  The graphics are stellar, despite being screwed on the PS3...(360 got the 720i).  With all of the rumors about Rockstar being purchased by Electronic Arts, possibly this was a little rushed in order to increase their asking price.  Hopefully EA can polish the graphics and control for the next edition and tweak the missions and storyline.",4,Great Freshman Effort on PS3,2008/5/1 0:00
A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000HKP88C,"Cloud ...""""",2,1,"There's certain game series where I can say that I enjoy playing and find myself itching to play the next installment but I wouldn't call myself a die-hard fan of them either. It's sort of the difference between the day one buys and the ones you eventually buy down the line. I always enjoyed the Grand Theft Auto series when it made the move to 3D but I never really considered them my favorite series in gaming but since I have a Playstation 3, naturally this was on my ones to get. Seeing it all but shatter records including the massive amount of sales it sold within the first week, it certainly can raise the idea that this is one of the best video games ever. Well, it's impressive definately though the best might depend on how swept away you are by it.Story: You play as Niko Bellic, an immigrant fresh off the boat arriving in Liberty City (redesigned from the one seen in GTA3) with ideas to start living the American dream"", complete with money, women and success. But the dream always ends up better than reality and Niko and cousin Roman broke and living in poor conditions though through ties, connections and double-crossings, Niko can work his way up the ladder though success can also bring pain as well.Anyone who's ever played any of the previous releases will find themselves on familiar ground and the story found here is similar. You start either with nothing (here and San Andreas) or you're double-crossed forcing you to climb back up (Vice City, 3) and start taking on missions from numerous characters as you progress in making friends and new enemies. The problem is while Niko is a likable and even funny character, the supporting cast and their missions still follow the impersonal feel others had. Somebody will know somebody who will probably have more work for you and he/she will have you either kill someone or steal something or protect someone. After awhile it gets a bit too same-y and while the story is interesting, having to go on another assassin request gets kind of old.Graphics: If one were to look at 4 compared to San Andreas in terms of size, the PS2 game wins simply due to how much of it is actually in there. We have 3 cities, plus the outskirts in between each city but with the redesigned Liberty City which looks even more like New York than in 3, it's more about it being more detailed and diverse in its locations than simply a bunch of roads and buildings. The best part of the graphics I find are the lighting and the city looks quite gorgeous at night and especially moody if it's raining or a huge storm is around. There's the occasional framerate stutter and going super fast on your car creates a giant blur and pop-up issues but it's still quite a great looking game.Sound/Music: I've always loved the Grand Theft Auto series for its voice acting, mainly for how realistic it feels. While the Metal Gear Solid series is always well-done, the sheer amount of dialogue about politics, biology and the like makes it a bit too boring to hear. But here, characters talk like actual people and some are amusing in their own way. Sure Brucie basically feels like an OG Loc imitator and subtitles are all but required for Little Jacob and his friend Badman, it's still fun to hear the varied cast of characters.What I feel is a step-down is the music on the radio stations. One of the fun things about getting into a car was wondering what station it be tuned to and there's nothing like killing a crime boss with classical music blaring in a sort of ""Godfather"" moment or having a heavy rock song accompanying a high speed chase but here, I mainly tuned to the Chatterbox-esque stations and listened to hilarious skits and commercials.Gameplay: Same ideas as before. From missions to various stores like clothing, restaurants and strip joints but there is some changes and one is in the combat. While the targeting can still be improved, no longer being out in the open but instead taking on a Uncharted/Gears of War approach and being able to take cover helps though you'll occasionally be on the wrong side. My other gripe is actually choosing where you want to shoot and while sometimes you can choose who you want to shoot at, more often than that, your trigger seems to never want to leave the one guy across the way instead of the guy shooting and taking cover 10 feet to your right. There's a bit of free-aim if you lightly press R2 but it's not really as precise.I'm sure many will agree that getting chased by cops frequently got annoying in past games and it's still here and cops are still a bit too biased to you as well. On one mission, things go horribly wrong and we get surrounded by backstabbers prompting us to defend for ourselves. Only instead of the cops being called on the ones who started it, they're after your foreign butt and all but ignore the other handgun-wielding thugs. Should you be forced to be on the run, a circle will appear on your radar showing you the range of the police's reach in their wanting to arrest you so how to you drop your wanted level? Easy, outrun them and be outside their zone for a bit and poof, they forget about you. That is if you don't run smack into another police car, re-centering the circle and forcing you to outrun the new guy. Like the combat, it's a great idea but not as refined.Ditto for the cell phone which has been upgraded since San Andreas. Friends you make can be contacted and missions can pop up or they just call to make comments but the big feature is the options. Like a more enhanced girlfriend mechanic that San Andreas had where the more you date them, the more they like you, now everybody in your phone list pretty much can be taken out, whether to a restaurant or strip club or shoot some pool or take in a performance at a cabaret club. It's neat though used a bit annoyingly since you might call a girlfriend for a date while somebody else calls during the date asking you if you want to do something. Should you say no, they're a little bit upset with you. So wonderful, not only do I have to worry about making friends upset in real life, now I have to worry about Niko in a videogame being seen as an ***hole. But the phone does have messages, organizers for dates and meetings and you'll find yourself frequently consulting it.At this point, the amount of hype and success this game got seems dangerously close to overshadow the actual game itself with many finding disappointment in a game that isn't all that different from previous games and introduces new ideas that aren't fully fleshed out. However, along with Metal Gear Solid 4, it's hard to think of any other title currently on the Playstation 3 with the huge amount of attention and buzz so I'd recommend playing this though if you thought the games were starting to become a bit too formulaic then Grand Theft Auto IV might be a game that you'll admire more than fully love.""",4,When size can matter,2008/9/24 0:00

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000JLIXIG,"Cloud ...""""",1,1,"Back in late 2006, the Playstation 3 launched a year after the Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Wii and it was met with a share bit of indifference. First there was the price at 599, then there was the launch titles which were good but there wasn't that one Halo or Mario 64 that said THIS is why you're spending all that money so you can play "". Turns out the PS3 is actually a quite serviceable game console and one of the more premier titles that was released at the time of launch was ""Resistance: Fall of Man"", a WWII shooter with an intriguing premise brought to you by the studio who made ""Ratchet and Clank"". How's the game? Good but not completely excellent but does its job admirably.Story: It's 1951 and World War II never happened. Rather a different kind of force raged through Europe; that of the Chimera, an alien (or genetic creation? I don't know )race that conquered Russia and Europe incredibly quickly and sets their sights on England. But the Americans, like the real World War II, shows up later and among the soldiers is Nathan Hale whose missions will take him deep into Chimeran territory to hopefully wipe them out.Graphics: Resistance in terms of framerate is incredibly smooth with barely any problems in terms of slowdown, jitteryness or screen tearing and such which is quite a feat considering the battleground can be quite chaotic. Other areas however are a bit hit-or-miss with up close textures looking a bit bland while things far away look pretty remarkable and some cool ""sci-fi spaceship"" designs near the end of the level. The detail on the Chimera themselves as well look quite good and the variety is also welcome but as a launch title that shows the power of the PS3, this doesn't have the wow factor of Tools of Destruction has.Sound/Music: Like a lot of WWII shooters, heavy on the military style percussion, trumpet and big epic flavors during the bigger firefights. Though you might get sick of the small music interlude when you die, especially in later levels. As for voice acting, the main draw is the VA for Rachel Parker who acts as a narrator and she's very good at bringing you in to the action rather than just a plain old ""storyteller"" during cutscenes. Nathan Hale probably has more lines of dialogue than Insomniac has games however which makes him a strange hero, bad*** enough but not much of a character.Gameplay: The meat of this is an FPS and there's not much else to it then that. You have your squad members occasionally with you (who die too frequently and too quickly), you alone against a legion of troops, vehicle sections where you command a tank, a jeep and a really cool vehicle later on as well as guns and grenades but Resistance mainly does one thing differently and that's regarding your arsenal. Instead of being limited to 2 guns, the game offers a weapon wheel where all the weapons you found will stay with you till the end of the game and though some incredulous thinking kind of makes it funny (a guy can fit a sniper rifle, missile launcher, and at least 7 other guns in his pocket? Hm.) it does add some good incentive to experiment. Snipe some dudes from afar, lay down explosive goo as traps, and more, having a full inventory to choose from helps you with any situation as opposed to the sequel where the 2-weapon-only scheme made you go ""do I bring this or that one?""Like the Ratchet and Clank games, Insomniac loves to brainstorm really messed up weapons. Each weapon has an alternate fire which is specific to that gun. Your typical plasma gun Bullseye can ""tag"" an enemy so that all gunfire will zero in on that dude specifically or the Augur which can fire through walls but also set up a bulletproof shield temporarily. My favorite though is the Fareye which can slow down time so you can shoot enemy heads more accurately. This ingenuity even goes down to the grenades which adds 2 types other than the traditional frag: the hedgehog which fires a large group of spikes to impale enemies and the air-fuel grenade which can create a flammable vapor which incinerates nearby enemies. It gives a bit more interest than just simply ""oh hey look, another assault rifle type, whoopee"".However, I do have a couple of complaints. The control scheme is a little funky and I had to switch shoulder buttons around to make it more comfortable but my least favorite thing is having your aim be the right analog which like Killzone 2 never feels as comfortable as using the Left Trigger buttons and it's somewhat disorienting to reload during a zoom in since it goes back to a zoom-in when you maybe just want to return to normal view and more than once I died because I couldn't get out of a zoom look quickly enough. And like Resistance 2, it's a ""learn by death"" game where the more you play, the more you figure out your strategies by what NOT to do such as blindly going in quickly or not paying attention to one key area. And since enemies are incredibly good shots, this makes it a pain when 4 or 5 get the surprise on you and even headshots don't down them immediately so it makes managing the battlefield stressful.Oop, almost forgot multiplayer. Up to 40 players with your standard Deathmatch and Team DM, Capture the Flag and Bombing variances are here but the battles are so frantic that it's like a huge playground where everyone's in the thick of it. One complaint that I have about the equally-fun Killzone 2 online component is that the maps start you at one end while enemies spawn at the other and you end up meeting in the middle. But since spawn points are within a gigantic square as it were, you have to be on your toes a lot more since you can spawn a corner away from 3 dudes aching for some kills. And best part of all? No noticeable lag whatsoever and haven't experienced one disconnect. While I wish the co-op was online as well as with the single player campaign rather than a separate file, the online in this game is quite a blast.Resistance: Fall of Man in terms of a story has a bit more weight than the sequel did but the frequent cutscene interruptions just when things are getting more intense slightly annoy. With the requisite intel to collect and other difficulties to tackle, Fall of Man is a good game to check out though strangely, Insomniac seems to really pull out some wonders when they do the Ratchet and Clank stuff.""",4,Good game for an ordinary shooter,2009/6/15 0:00

It also offers great online multiplayer gameplay.The plot is that, around the time of World War II, enemies attacked the world, starting with Russia and moving westward through Europe and England. In the 50s, the US launched a counter-attack, landing in England. You're fighting, at least to start with, with WWII era weapons and outfits through the streets of England.Let's start with the graphics. The game goes for a very Call of Duty style of look - not quite realistic, more cartooney"" or stylized. Textures are smoothed out, some objects are simplified. That's not to say this is a Disney kiddie look. The monsters are grimey and nasty looking, the war-torn streets are very gritty. If anything, because this is set in a WWII type atmosphere, much of the game is brown, grimy and shell-shocked.The HUD is reasonably well done and not intrusive. A small series of bars on the left indicates your health. An equally small but useful display on the right tracks your ammo, magazines and grenades.The sound leans towards epic thundering scores, a la Gladiator or Conan. Players who love heavy rock music might not enjoy this, but I actually love this kind of music. I own both of the soundtracks I mentioned :). So to me, this really draws you into the atmosphere. The yells, gun noises and so on seem relatively realistic to help you feel you're really in the middle of a fight. I also like that, during gameplay, it's usually done without music. If I'm trying to sneak somewhere and listen for enemy movement, I don't want that objective made difficult by a soundtrack.Gameplay itself is typical FPS fare. You can crouch, jump over things, zoom in on your enemy, throw grenades, strafe, and so on. Your friends and enemies are rather good about taking cover and not just rushing an enemy head-on. There are a few situations which seem quite scripted - if your pals are meant to die, you could play perfectly and take out every enemy quickly and your friends will still be killed by mysterious off-screen snipers. Still, the game needs to keep you on course for the plot so this is to be expected.Checkpointing is reasonably good, although sometimes it sends you further back then you might like to start again. Healing is done via canisters you find, but depending on your skill you might wish there were more canisters scattered around :). That's why they have 3 levels of difficulty here.The interactivity with your environment is pretty impressive. Say your enemy is hiding behind a car. You can shoot out the car's windows and then shoot the enemy through the open space. Or you can shoot the car to damage it, and have it explode a la the infamous 'red exploding barrels' found in most shooting games. If you shoot at a window a few times, it will first crack, then pieces will fall out.Not only is the game great in single player mode, but you can play co-op with a friend at your home, or online in larger groups with friends or strangers from around the world. This helps turn the game from a play-for-a-few-months-at-home style game to a play-eternally-with-friends-online game.Well recommended!""",5,Great Shooter Title for the PS3,2006/11/18 0:00

Of course consoles don't see their full capabilities until 5-10 years down it's life cycle. When the PS3 launched everyone wanted to see something that would be worth a $600 purchase, but I don't think Resistance was it.You play as an infected soldier named Nathan Hale who is fighting alongside the British to rid of the Chimera infestation and save humanity. The game has a WWII setting that feels familiar yet not enough to be labeled as Oh, one of those again"".The main problem with Resistance: The difficulty. Oh my god is this game hard, so hard in fact that I couldn't even finish the game. There are about 30 levels, but the game is just so damned impossible to beat even on the easy setting. The game uses the ancient art of health packs and the game mechanics just feel dated and stiff.The only neat thing about the game are the weapons. You have regular fire modes, but interesting alternate fire modes such as the Bullseye's tag mode. You can tag an enemy and shoot around corners and the bullets will home in on the target. The sniper rifle lets you slow down time, one weapon even shoots up temporary shields. This, however, is not enough to save this frustratingly hard and linear game from getting sent right back to the store.The story may seem interesting, but it's slow and doesn't pick up much. The graphics, compared to games now, are ugly and dated and don't seem fully HD. Every weapon, no matter how powerful, all feel like they do the same amount of damage. Each Chimera creature takes forever to kill almost two whole clips some times, even on the weak ones! The game throws way to many enemies at you at once, and your health goes to zero in about five seconds. There's not lean button, so this means the game is poorly balanced and not much play testing went on.If you think the multiplayer saves the game it doesn't. You can have up to 30 players on one map, but no one is playing this online anymore, and the firefights are boring and a huge mess thanks to the dated stiff game play. I love the creature designs and the way levels are setup, but this game just feel out of its time frame. One last thing that makes the game almost unplayable is the lack of ammo. This isn't a survivor horror is it? Then give me more ammo it's a war!

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000K9OP2A,"Cloud ...""""",0,0,"There's certain games that for some reason, have parts or gameplay ideas that just simply don't work. Whether they're frustrating and cumbersome or it's repetitive or it's just simply not a worthwhile thing in the first place. In a way, I call it the good idea/bad idea"" syndrome where developers believe that if something sounds fun for the player, than obviously it will be fun for them regardless of how well it's executed. Heavenly Sword became one of the Playstation 3's big launch titles and one of the first to show off the power of the machine. On that note, everything as far as the look of the game is spot-on; it's everything else that's the problem.Story: You play as Nariko, a young female warrior who wields the titular and powerful Heavenly Sword which corrupts men's minds who want to possess it yet claims the life of whoever wields it. King Bohan, an evil ruler wants the sword to himself and with huge armies at his disposal, it's up to Nariko and her friend Kai to try to bring down Bohan and his warriors.Naturally, the story is the big highlight of the game and while it's rather simple and not exactly the most complex or even original, the presentation and just the general feel of the game helps the story move along when it would've been slightly generic in other hands. So while indeed it's a short game, it's a good story anyway.Graphics: Thanks to being picky and having specific choices about what games I try out, I find graphically they've been pretty stellar. Heavenly Sword is one of them as this is one beautiful game from the art design and the environments to the fast, flowing character animation and the motion capture, this is definately a game that an HDTV-owner will love. Sure there's minor things like really brief pauses or slight framerate parts but again, super minor.Sound/Music: The music is naturally that big, orchestral sweeping score that these games tend to have, like God of War. It's a pleasant soundtrack when it's on though I find myself forgetting the music later than admiring it again when I play the game. The voice acting though is absolutely great and with some great performances including Anna Torv (from TV's ""Fringe"") and Andy Serkis (Gollum, King Kong), this is definately voice acting done well...except for this one guy named Flying Fox; one of the most annoying voices I've ever heard in a videogame and I'm well aware of Farleen from Star Ocean: Till the End of Time by the way.Gameplay: Basically one way to describe this game is God of War with a girl. It sounds simplistic and there's enough differences but fundamentally anyone who's ever lopped heads off with Kratos will find much familiarity here. Nariko has 3 stances: Speed (normal, sword attacks), Ranged (holding L1, long chain attacks) and Power (R1, slow powerful attacks) and it's fun to switch back and forth depending on the enemy and seeing Nariko flying all over the screen doing the combos is quite something. However you start the actual fighting and you find the enemies also use the stances too and they glow a color according to the stance they're using and if you're in the right stance and don't press anything, Nariko will block and a successful one and a push of the Triangle button will be a Counter Attack or even an Instant Kill. The problem is when you're surrounded by literally 10 or more enemies and you're building up your combo, it's hard to figure out what stance will be needed and they'll always be that one jerk that resets your combo meter because you just couldn't press it fast enough or he somehow dodged/phased through your attacks.Remember that good idea syndrome I talked about where developers believe a good idea will be awesome even though it might not work? This game has the Aftertouch system and it's annoying as hell. Basically, if Nariko throws something or if you're on a Kai mission with her bow, holding down the firing button brings up a travelling camera similar to firing the guided missiles from Metal Gear Solid and by tilting the controller, you can control the direction of the arrow. The problem is that the game requires such sensitivity that even with careful precision and slow movements, you still miss your target anyway. I found it was better to just turn it off and use the analog stick and the whole thing becomes similar to the Sixaxis use in Ratchet and Clank: neat but entirely unnecessary since the analog stick does a better job.The other gripe is the oft-used and already overused system of Quicktime Events where you have to either repeatedly hit one button or just hit it once during interactive cutscenes. While at least in a game like Resident Evil 4, it always felt at least anticipatory with a decent enough time given to press the buttons, here it's rather quick and it becomes more about restarting and memorizing not only the button required (thank God they're not randomly generated) but also the place within the cutscene. This makes boss battles even more aggravating since I found failure of the cutscene actually replenished the boss's health; yes that right, fills it right back up. And with limited health pots in the fighting area, it's aggravating to have to widdle the boss down again simply because you missed one button.With some boss fights that seem more like cheap hits and near-unavoidable attacks and a rather repetitive battle system with nothing gained other than more glyphs which unlock artwork, videos etc, is this a game worth getting? Well unless you're a massive fan than no. Not only because of its short length and 60$ price tag but for the game itself. Yes it's a beautiful game and a great story but at times it felt more frustrating to play than fun.""",3,3.5; Last-gen trying to be next-gen,2008/10/10 0:00

Heavenly Sword, the eagerly anticipated hack & slasher from Sony, may look as if it's a toned down God of War, but don't let that fool you.  Boasting some incrediblely mouth watering graphics and superb controls, Heavenly Sword puts you in the role of Nariko: a female warrior who wields said sword and takes down hordes of enemies in the process.  While this may sound like it'll get boring after a while (like many games of the genre do), Heavenly Sword manages to keep things pretty fresh by implementing different play styles, playable characters, and puzzle elements as well.  The game also boasts some incredible production values, excellent music and sound effects, great voice acting, and entertaining cinematics and story as well.  The only real negative to Heavenly Sword is that the game is quite short.  It won't take you long to get through the game (you could beat it in an afternoon if you so desired), and though there are a nice selection of unlockables and extras to find as well, the replay factor isn't very high here.  Not to mention that the puzzle elements aren't anything we haven't seen before either, but these negatives don't take away the fact that Heavenly Sword is one of the best, original games to hit the PS3 yet.

There have been some failed system launches with either very few games or just poor ones. The PS3 was not such a console especially with Heavenly Sword backing it and wowing gamers across the world. Heavenly Sword puts the characters Nariko and Kai in your hands as you battle an evil warlord trying to take over your clans' land.Right from the start of the game you get introduced to sweeping epic landscapes, amazing graphics, beautiful sounds, and a great, albeit simple, combat system. For being a launch title the game has excellent production values and they really shine for the PS3.The most important part of Heavenly Sword is the combat system and it never falters. You don't receive the Heavenly Sword until a bit into the game, but once you do you are welcomed to three different fighting styles on the fly. Instead of having to stop the game and switch styles you can use them with just holding down a button. You are always in speed"" mode which breaks the sword into two swords while L1 puts you in ""range"" mode that is kind of like Kratos' chain swords in God of War (which Heavenly Sword receives its nick name ""Goddess of War""), and lastly holding down R1 puts you in ""power"" mode. There are a good amount of combos that let you switch in and out of these styles with amazing animations, and a cinematic sweeping camera. Another element to the game play is the counter system. The enemy will glow the color of the style you need to be in to counter. Standing still is automatic block so hitting an attack button at the right time will perform a killer counter attack.On top of this you play as Kai who has a deadly semi-automatic crossbow that can be controlled with ""aftertouch"" which is controlled with the SixAxis motion controls. This was one of the first game to really utilize the SixAxis with bone crunching and nasty kills from guided bows or anything else you can hurl at the enemy.Puzzles in the game aren't really a challenge since there aren't many of them, but the bosses are. Each boss has multiple health bar, and once you get one knocked down you initiate a button pressing sequence by hitting circle (sounds just like God of War). Some bosses are just downright hard and seem impossible to beat, but remembering their attacks is the key.Not only does the game look and sound amazing, but the story is riveting ad so is the acting. With full motion capture sequences this game has some of the most realistic facial animations I have ever seen. With Andy Serkis (Lord of the Rings, Ink Heart) as a director and actor on board you are treated with amazing work.If the combat isn't satisfying enough for you there are epic battles where you fight thousands of soldiers on-screen at once. Shooting a cannon and using after touch is just so satisfying especially towards the end of the game. If you are also curious about collecting items you can unlock stuff by doing certain tasks or meeting certain goals in each section of the game. With such a beautiful game you would want to see how it was made.If I had to see a flaw in Heavenly Sword it would be that the game is extremely short clocking in at 4-6 hours depending on your play style. You could literally beat this in one or two long play sessions. The game also has some technical issues with some slow down, and occasional choppy animation. The combat is also a bit shallow and a tad to button mashy. Other than that I can't wait for the sequel to be announced, but it has been over 3 years and no word, so I feel this great new IP has been abandoned.""",4,Wonderful camera work makes Heavenly Sword epic,2012/3/28 0:00

Don't get me wrong, the swordplay makes God Of War feel almost childish, but the real bliss of this game is in the aftertouch"" mechanism. Anytime you throw or shoot an object, this gives you the ability to control the movement of that object with the six-axis AND gives you a birds eye view of the movement. It's one of the most addictive additions to any game I've ever played. The graphics and voice acting here are superb. It looks and feels amazing. You also get control of 2 characters throughout, not just the one shown on the box. The other quirky little arrow shooter you get to play with reminds me of Bjork. And I rather like that.

The games are SUPPOSED to be simple and take advantage of the way you use the Wii Remote, and that's *exactly* what the majority of the games on the disc do.  Not only that, but you're given an option to play up to 10 games, each of them VERY different from the next.My favorite game is probably pool (billiards) because I grew up playing pool in a room we called the pool room"" on the second floor of my house (now a spare bedroom) and I simply had the time of my life with it.  Playing pool in video game form is a bit odd because of the way you're required to line up a target on the cue ball in order to shoot.  It's still quite fun though.  It just takes time to learn the controls.Another great game is the fishing one, where your fishing pole has to be in the water and the object is to catch as many fish as you can in a certain amount of time.  While it CAN be frustrating learning to keep the fishing pole in the water, it can be figured out with practice.  Just don't jerk the Wii Remote around and you'll be fine.Laser hockey rules.  Again, don't jerk the Wii Remote around, or you'll jerk the controls too hard and end up missing some fairly easy shots, and the computer will take advantage of that and win the games.  I find that sitting about 10 feet away from the TV screen with my arm extended helps prevent me from getting the urge to jerk the Wii Remote too far up, down, left or right.The shooting games (which are actually target-shooting games) are REALLY good.  You have to shoot balloons, targets, cans, spaceships, ducks, clay pigeons, and other things to collect points.  It's very similar to the classic Duck Hunt game.  I remember Duck Hunt really well!  First game I ever had.Now for the bad- there's a game where you have to match two look-alike Mii's, and find the odd person out of a group of many.  Only problem is, I can't figure out what the ""odd person"" is supposed to mean after playing the game 20 times.Also, there's another game where you have to move these miniature army tanks around and shoot down your opponent, and this game is EXTREMELY hard because moving the target into an accurate aiming position is almost impossible.

A lot of the fun with Wii has been re-discovering classic games with the new gesture controls. So you're still playing stuff like Duck Hunt, table hockey, pool, etc, only now the wii-mote controls make those simple diversions refreshing again. Where the package fails is that not every mini-game is a classic. The 'where's waldo' game is a dud for me, as is the one where you have to turn your Mii to fit inside a bubble. Others like cow racing and fishing are middle of the pack. All of them make for decent diversions with friends, but there's not quite as many mini games that stand up to extended play. Wii Sports was the better 'demo' package.Of course, you're also getting a wii-mote when you buy this, which may justify the overall value.

A better way to look at this is that you get a remote along with a free or perhaps cheap game. The games aren't great, but they're certainly not awful!We had two Wii remotes and wanted a third one, so we could do party multiplayer. We assumed that the games that came with this would let you have more than 2 people playing. Wrong! These are all only two player games. That really seems a shame for a system that is set up to be a party machine.The games are all rather straightforward and use the basic Wii remote functions. You can do a target shooting where you shoot at targets, ducks, cans, skeet targets and even space aliens. There's a pattern matching game where you try to figure out which Miis are the same or different. In another game, you rotate and change poses of your Miis to match the shape shown. There's a simple ping-pong, a simple table hockey, a simple pool, a cow race, a fishing game, and then tanks.I had high hopes for many of these games. I love pool, I enjoy target shooting, and even fishing can be great fun. For whatever reason, they just didn't implement any of the games very well. Fishing in Zelda is FAR more fun than this fishing version. Pool is done much better in many other games. Even the target practice isn't varied enough to be interesting.The only game that really holds our interest for long periods is the tank game. I *love* the tank game. It can be quite challenging, and is fun to play both alone and with others.Really, you're not paying much at all for this game set. You're getting a nice remote, and you get the games for free. If you've got very young kids, they might be quite happy with racing cows, knocking over scarecrows, and trying to get the very best cow-racing score they can. In that case, you're all set!

The Wii Remote ha worked so well at changing the way we play the games on television so well, it just is more fun to play video games on television. When the Wii came out, it came with Wii Sports, a game that flexed our muscles at how we play baseball, bowling, and tennis. Now, another game is trying to do the same thing, but does it work?Wii Play for the Nintendo Wii, feels like a spin-off to Wii Sports, as you play and conquer through several different mini-games and table sports like billiards, table tennis and table hockey. The gameplay is simple to use with the Wii remote, which also comes with the game, as a convient price. There are some highlights like the shooting range, which brings back the classic gameplay from the NES classic Duck Hunt. The graphics look nice, and the control handles very well. Still, there are a few disadvantages with the game. One of them is the lack of challenge on some of the games, with billiards you only play a 9-ball game, rather than other variations like 15 or 10-ball. Another disadvantage, is that there could've been more games to play with like shuffleboard, to add on to the excitement.Still, Wii play works great as a multiplayer game, but for single player action, it really isn't exciting.

This is because it's from Nintendo, and so far, every first party title from the company on the Wii has ranged from good to spectacular.  Wii Play includes a Wii remote, and is only a little more expensive than the remote itself, so think of it as buying a new remote with a bonus disc of games.  The games themselves take advantage of your Miis and makes great use of them as well.  In that respect alone, Wii Play is worth checking out, but the mini games themselves aren't very fun, and the ones that are (like Shooting Range) don't have much of a lasting appeal.  Billiards however is the best of the bunch here, and makes great use of the Wii's abilities.  All that being said, Wii Play is worth a look at the least, and is worth picking up if you want another remote and don't mind spending a little extra cash for another disc of mini-games, but don't expect the same kind of lasting appeal or fun that you got with Wii Sports or Wario Ware.",3,Disappointing collection of mini-games with a remote,2007/7/28 0:00

Wii Play is somewhat like Wii Sports.  It's basically another game to give you a preview of what the Wii can do.  Unlike Wii Sports, however, the games aren't nearly as good and they aren't as memorable.  Part of what made Wii Sports so great was its simplistic, yet involving, gameplay.  Wii Play doesn't make you feel nearly as involved as Wii Sports does.  To its credit, however, it does come with a Wii Remote packaged inside, but if you really really loved Wii Sports, you're definitely going to be let down Wii Play.There are nine games in Wii Play.  One is very similar to Duck Hunt in that you have to use the Wii Remote as a gun and shoot things.  Fairly simple, but it leaves an empty feeling in you.  Another game involves you having to find certain Mii's (imagine Where's Waldo).  There's Table Tennis, a game where you pop bubbles, billiards, laser hockey, fishing, some game where you ride a cow and Tanks.  With Nine games you're bound to find something good, but Laser Hockey may very well be the best of the lot.None of the games are really that bad, they're just not as involving or as fun as Wii Sports, nor can they hit that level of addiction that Wii Sports gives you.  Which is why I say that if you really do love Wii Sports, then Wii Play is a let down.  You get a Wii Remote packed in with the game, though, so it's almost like buying the game itself for ten dollars.  Sadly, the Wii Remote alone may be the reason to buy this seeing as how as this review is being written, Wii Remotes in your local retail store are still pretty hard to come by.None of the games are horrible, but none of them have any lasting appeal.  You'll grow bored with most of them after a couple of plays.

That has been the case with great games that really showed it like Excite Truck and the dramatic The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess. With all that said about great games, mini-game excitement has also delivered too with the return of the Mario Party series. It has been almost 2 years since the franchise had its last game on the Nintendo Gamecube, and worked like a charm by being innovative and fun for all ages. Now, it has finally made its way onto the Wii, but is it worth the wait.Mario Party 8 for the Nintendo Wii is a wild and addictive game that brings out a simplicity for gamers young and old alike, as you unlock and play over 70 minigames that are easy and fun to play. There are also a few new additions here too, as you can also unlock players including Blooper, the sea squid from the Super Mario Brothers games, and Hammer Brothers, which recently returned in a great set of guest cameos in Super Mario Strikers and Mario Superstar Baseball. The graphics are delightful but the gameplay is definitely what brings the game to its success, as you use the Wii remote to play in games like waving a magic wand and using an energy ball to strike Bowser in a one on one showdown, punching a statue to smitherines with a boxing glove, or using it you are shaking a soda can and creating a gusher in one of the duel minigames. You can also use your Mii characters that you've created from games like Wii Sports and have them play in the Star Carnival and play games like ping pong. The graphics are delightful and the sound carries well throughout each of the boards, but the gameplay really does deliver for new Wii owners as well as die hard Mario fans alike.All in all, Mario Party 8 is a delightful game that welcomes the party franchise Wii owners well. I loved what the series brought out for so many years, and I know that this edition does a great job as well.

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000LSJKAM,S. Rhodes,222,183,"Ever since Mario Party debuted on the Nintendo 64, we've been receiving a new game in the series on a yearly basis.  The last few Mario Party games have all been tiring.  Almost rehashes.  However, with the Wii, Mario Party has a chance to be a lot of fun again thanks to the Wii-Remote.  Unfortunately, it isn't all its cracked up to be.  The Wii-Remote controls work, but they feel like a last minute tack on, and ultimately some of the mini-games just aren't all that fun.  Finally, there are other video games chock full of mini-games that make much better use of the Wii-Remote than Mario Party 8.The formula for Mario Party really hasn't changed at all over the years.  You and your friends (or the computer) will roll the die, move around the board at the end of each round of rolls you'll be thrown into a mini-game.The mini-games are pretty short.  Most of them being around 30 seconds long.  Some of them are quite fun and make good use of the wii remote, such as the game where you have to shake up a soda can, or wipe off the chomp.  However, there are not a lot of these kinds of mini-games.  Most other mini-games don't make as big of an impression with the wii-remote, as most of them consist of you holding the wii remote like a basic gamepad and then tilting it left or right.  Take for example, the game where you race on water skis.  You don't actually do anything outside of tilting the wii remote left and right to jump ramps.  It is in moments like these where the wii remote controls just feel tacked on.  And unfortunately, this comes up in quite a few mini games.  There are also a lot of mini games that simply have you tilting the Wii-Remote forward and backward.  Again, the controls feel tacked on in instances like this.The biggest slap in the face, however, is that there are a myriad of mini-games that don't use the wii-remotes motion sensor controls at all and you'll hold it like a gamepad, and play with it like it's a gamepad using the D-Pad to move your character and all.  It's also to no credit that these games aren't really all that fun.To the game's credit, though, when they do make good use of the wii-remote and its motion sensor controls, they really do a bang up job.  Such as the mini-game where everyone shoots at the screen while one person dodges.  It's just unfortunate that there aren't a lot of mini-games that do so, and instead make you either play the traditional way or just simply tilt the wii remote.  There are some fun games here, but the game is populated by more games that really aren't a lot of fun.As usual, Mario Party games are no fun by yourself.  They need to be played with friends and family.  Like previous installments, multi-player can be a lot of fun--provided you get a good mini-game.  Some of the games are free-for-all but there are also some games where you'll be by yourself against three players, or working together with one other player.  Mostly, though, they're free for alls, and playing with a friend is nice just so that you can see who's better.  Multi-player has always been a strong aspect of Mario Party and it's no different in number 8.  However, much like previous installments, the game is entirely left up to chance.  One moment you're in first place, and after the very next roll you're in last.  It's annoying sometimes because you really don't have any control.  It's all a game based on luck.  This is both a good and bad thing. Good because it makes the outcome unpredictable, and once more anyone can play this without any prior experience.  It's bad, however, because for some who like to add a little strategy to their gaming, you just can't do it here.Perhaps the biggest problem facing Mario Party 8 is that it doesn't really present a whole lot of new stuff that wasn't in Mario Party 7.  With the game making use of the Wii-Remote, one would expect the experience to be quite different.  Instead it's more of the same thing.  Especially because there are other games on the Wii that are filled with mini-games that make far better use of the remote (Rayman Raving Rabbids comes to mind).  In Mario Party 8 the wii remote controls either feel tacked on or you don't really use them.  It's also hard to get past the fact that the mini-games aren't very inventive because of this.  Certainly water-skiing is fun, but when you're just tilting left and right throughout the whole thing?  You might as well have just put this on the Gamecube and let me tilt the analog stick left and right.Graphically, it's no surprise that Mario Party 8 isn't the best looking game out there.  Mario Party games usually aren't.  At least it runs smoothly.  There's no slow down or frame rate issues.  It really doesn't look any different than any of the Mario Party games on the Gamecube however, and those who have a widescreen television will be disappointed to know that the game won't take up the whole screen, and instead will give you a boarder.  Luckily, graphics don't make the game.  Mario Party doesn't look bad, it just looks dated.Mario Party 8 had so much potential.  If they'd done more intuitive things with the Wii Remote, this may have been worth a buy.  There are other mini-game collections out there that utilize the wii remote much better than this.  There will be plenty of gamers out there that will be able to get past the big flaws and just have fun with it, but if you're one who's been playing Mario Party since the beginning, you can't help but admit a change is in order.  Unfortunately Mario Party 8 doesn't do much for you.Pros:+When the Wii Controls are good, the games are actually quite fun+Simplistic gameplay; anyone could pick this up and play it with no problems+There are over 60 mini-games to playCons:-There are far too many mini-games where the wii controls feel tacked on, and these games are pretty boring to play-There are far too many mini-games that don't make use of the motion sensor controls at all-There are not a lot of very inventive mini-games-In short, the game doesn't do much to stand out above previous Mario Party installments.  You'd think with the Wii Remote, Mario Party 8 would be something new to experience, but instead it ends up not being that much of a step higher than Mario Party 7",3,A Mediocre Party,2007/5/31 0:00

Otherwise, I would imagine that Super Paper Mario"" would have tons of reviews at this moment. This is an incredibly solid game.Less ""Paper Mario"" than ""Super Mario"", the game returns Mario to his 2-D roots. Gone are turn-based battles, and in their place, good 'ole hoppin' and boppin' fun, like in the old days, but with one clever twist. When your character is faced with, say, an impossible jump, you can simply ""flip"" yourself into three dimensions, the result of which is often the opening of a new path, or the emergence of a hidden pipe, etc. It's a clever twist on the 2-D goodness of the old ""SMB"" games of the Nintendo and Super Nintendo.If I had one complaint with the game, it's that it's a bit too easy. With the ability to level ones character, the challenging aspects of the original ""SMB"" games gets a bit lost (in particular, the character will NOT die from falling in a hole, and can sustain multiple hits before running out of heart points, which can be replenished by items, or even hidden mushrooms). But make no mistake - while the game is never particularly challenging, it is always fun. The dialogue is snappy (the ""dating sim"" send-up is incredibly humorous, e.g.), the controls are good and responsove (I would have liked to see the nunchuk controller used a bit, particularly for the 3-D sections, but this is a mild complaint), the graphics are pretty...interesting, and the whole experience is trippy, in a ""Katamari"" sort of way.All in all, a solid Wii outing - this is one of those games that makes you happy to own the system.""",5,Solid Fun,2007/4/12 0:00
A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000NNDN1M,"Cloud ...""""",6,4,"A lot of people see the Mario franchise, the most well-known and successful franchise in Nintendo's catalogue, as a kind of standard of excellence. You rarely, if ever, have a completely bad Mario game (I am of course not counting decent Luigi's Mansion, horrid Mario is Missing or his sports excursions like Baseball and Soccer. Aside from the main canon which includes Mario World, Mario 64, Mario Sunshine and Mario Galaxy, the RPG/Paper series has always been quite successful as well. Now the third installment in the Paper series is back and while I still love its premise, this is just not as great as Thousand Year Door was.Story: The book Dark Prognosticus has foretold the destruction of the worlds brought on by Count Bleck when he brings about the mystical Chaos Heart. However, a group of good decide to counteract it and make the Light Prognosticus which foretells of a coming hero, which is of course Mario. With the help of Princess Peach, Luigi and even Bowser, Mario has to once again rid the world of evil (although surprisingly not the Princess for a change).Graphics: The graphics reminded me of Thousand Year Door but that's not a bad thing, since that game had impressive visuals, especially its special effects and lighting. Super Paper Mario is basically cut from the same mold with bright, vibrant graphics. However this is the 2D world since the 3D side just looks plain and ugly. But still, it's a game where you can show off your TV since the image looks so clear.Sound/Music: Kind of unremarkable to be honest. I was so caught up in the gameplay that I completely tuned out the rather drab music. Some might disagree and say they're catchy but since the Mario series has had catchy themes like Starman to the Underworld, it's disappointing there really isn't anything like it here.Gameplay: Thousand Year Door's gimmick was that Mario gained paper-like abilities such as rolling and squeezing through cracks. This game is based on the idea that Mario can turn the 2D world into 3D. A common example is a wall that's too high to jump over in 2D. Stuck? No. Just go to 3D and that wall is right in the middle of a wide path and you can just walk around. What's disappointing is that it wasn't implemented that much with puzzles relegated simply to flipping"" the world. Not to mention it's kind of an easy game with barely any difficulty. But one thing that's great is the controls with Mario & Co. being more responsive than ever, unlike clunky butterfingers New Super Mario Bros.Instead of having teammates battling in RPG style turn-based battles, we're back to old-school platforming with Mario jumping on enemies. You can still use items like bombs, flames and whatnot. Defeating one nets you EXP where you can level up though this wasn't as implemented all that well. You almost forget about until the screen says you leveled up and you go ""oh...okay then."" Also your characters are interchangeable so if you hit a snag, you can change to say Princess Peach who can glide with her umbrella or Bowser with his fire breath. Even though they're more established characters, I kind of preferred Vivian, Goombella and Ms. Mowz from Thousand Year Door better since they felt like more fleshed out characters.So that's gotta be it right? Nope. Along the way, Mario can get so-called ""Pixls"", flying butterflies that can perform certain actions. Since you're holding the Wii-remote sideways a la NES controller, you have to go in the menu and change them out. Some range from platform-making to bombs to grabbing enemies/items from afar and many others.  All of this gameplay variety and it's surprising at how...dull it feels. Of course it's Mario so you're going to play but it just feels kind of bland at times without those long playtimes previous games had whereas this game feels like it's best to play in short bursts.Is it a bad Mario game? Well no since there's still Mario is Missing and that time travel one. It just feels like you've played better Mario games before.""",3,3.5; Solid if unspectacular Mario entry,2007/4/28 0:00

There have been a lot of great games for it like The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and Excite Truck. Sadly, many gamers have been anxiously waiting the new Super Mario Galaxy, and hoping Mario would deliver again. Unfortunately, gamers will have to wait. However, a different Mario game has arrived from the die hard Paper Mario franchise from the gamecube and Nintendo 64 eras. There also is something that makes this paper seem better than flat, but will it satisfy Mario fans for now?Super Paper Mario for the Nintendo Wii, brings nack what made the Paper Mario games deliver in true role play. This time around, the game really does think out of the box, as Mario, Luigi, Peach and Bowser try to tackle the vicious Count Bleck and his minions Mr. L, Dimentio and others, as they tackle a fierce and wild world that seperates from the flipside and flopside. Each character has to unlock pixels, which help you through achievements from finding hidden doors, to lifting bosses. There are over 30 different levels in the game that bring back the classic 2-D side-scrolling action from the original Super Mario Brothers, with a different twist. Each character you play has a special ability. Peach and Luigi have a high jump, Bowser has the traditional fire-blazes, but Mario has the best ability. He can flip his world from a 2-D, to 3-D, to find hidden items and unlock hidden areas. The graphics in the game are absolutely beautiful, and really bring the classic gameplay into a whole new perspective, while the control is really on target most of the time. You do get a bit frustrated finding the unlocked doors, but everything else works like a charm. The story line also is fun and entertaining in each world of the game, while the story is cute but enjoyable for all the worlds.All in all, Super Paper Mario is a well-rendered game for the Wii, and should entice new Mario fans, as well as those waiting Super Mario Galaxy.

For those who haven't played any of the previous games in the series, the Paper Mario series is different from typical Mario games in the sense that it combines elements of RPG's with the tried and true Mario style platforming.  Graphically, Mario and the rest of the characters on screen look like animated cardboard cutouts, though this is a lot more charming than it sounds.  For those who are familiar with the series, you may be pleased to know that the turn based fighting style is gone and in place is the typical Mario branded side scrolling, platforming adventure style that we all know and love.  What really makes Super Paper Mario so engaging however is the game's combination of 2-D and 3-D elements which switch on the fly during gameplay.  This feature allows for the player to discover new paths and hidden secrets that really up the replay value and overall gameplay experience, while providing solid and fun support for the Wii remote as well.

Still, it's definitely a game we've been waiting for and definitely a game worth getting a hold of. Simply put, this is one of the games Wii owners ought to want.The storyline in Super Paper Mario isn't really anything special, but it's certainly one to honor for its fine script and clever writing. An evil magician named Count Bleck plans on taking over the world, and as Mario you'll need to stop him by finding the pieces of the purity heart that'll allow you to do so. In truth, the storyline is actually really crazy, but I'd rather not give too much away. It's actually a really enjoyable story Mario fans will love in the long run.The game is very dialogue heavy but at least its creative. Much of it is very humorous and will have you laughing quite a bit. But when I say dialog heavy, I'm not kidding. You'll be mashing on the 2 button a lot. It wouldn't be so bad if characters didn't go on to explain such things that were useless.Super Paper Mario is truly something remarkable in terms of its gameplay. It mixes Platforming and RPG elements. There's still a need to level up and Mario has his set of HP but all the way, this is a platformer. It plays very similar to Super Mario Brothers on the NES. However, a slight problem with this kind of gameplay, is that those who were really addicted to side scrolling Mario games and were used to holding down a button to run will be surprised to learn there is no button to run! It's no big deal, but if you're feeling nostalgic (as you probably will playing this game) it's actually something long time Mario fans may have to get used to, especially because Mario doesn't move very fast.During the game you can press the A button and flip the screen from the 2D world to the 3D world any time you want. Most of the time you'll be playing the game in the 2D realm, but there's plenty to be done in 3D too. It's a necessity to getting past some of the games puzzles. If you're ever stuck on puzzle just try flipping. It's also used to get past environmental objects. If a pipe is too tall for Mario to jump over, for example, then you can switch the game to the 3D view and simply walk around it. You can't stay in 3D forever. If you stay in 3D for too long Mario will take damage.The problem with the gameplay is that the game is far too easy. Most enemies are easily dispatched and don't do much damage to you anyway. Even boss battles are of little challenge. The boss fights are fun, at least, requiring you to fight them in interesting ways, but they're still on the easy side. If you're an expert gamer, I don't predict you'll die anytime soon throughout your adventure.Mario also isn't alone. He'll be joined by Peach, Luigi and Bowser throughout his travels, and each of them has an ability they can do. Peach can float, Luigi has a high jump and Bowser can spit fire. You can switch between them at any time, and there are moments when you'll actually need a certain character to do things. However, the game relies heavily on the mechanic of going from 2D to 3D and only Mario can actually do this. Despite that you've got other characters, you'll still play through most of the game as Mario.Throughout your adventures you'll also collect Pixls. Little fairy like creatures that give Mario and company other abilities he can use. For example, early on in the game he meets a pixl that allows him to grab enemies and other objects and throw them. There are plenty of other powers. Needless to say, Super Paper Mario is filled with secrets.The wii remote works well with this game. As noted you'll hold it like an NES controller and play the game in basically the same style you played the original Super Mario Brothers. The Wii controls, however, feel a little tacked on. You can point the remote to search for hidden doors or scan enemies. You can also shake when you jump off an enemy to get more points. The wii remote doesn't have a big impact on the gameplay, though.Visually, of course, the game looks like a late generation Gamecube game. However, the games unique style alone warrants its beauty. The 2D landscape is far better looking than the 3D landscape, though. The 2D backgrounds are beautiful, and the background environments really shower a lot of detail. 3D doesn't look as good, though because it's just not as pretty and filled with life.  Most of the level designs themselves are also pretty plain. As far as platforming goes, there's nothing too intuitively designed either. The levels also aren't filled to the brim with enemies. There's a lot of jumping, but not a lot of obstacles in your way.The game also sounds really good. There's no voice acting to speak of, really. Which sucks for a game as text heavy as this, but most gamers who've been gaming for well over a decade probably won't care about this, anyway.On the whole, Super Paper Mario is a must own title for the Wii. It's been ingeniously designed; it's full of humor and has been cleverly written. And to top it all off, it's just a lot of fun to play.Pros:+Well crafted dialogue+VERY humorous game+Strikingly original gameplay elements+Simple easy gameplay to get a hold of+Good music+Plenty of things to do in the game+Cleverly designed puzzlesCons:-The game is far too easy for experienced gamers-Tacked on Wii Remote controls-Very dialogue heavy; it's GOOD dialogue, but there are moments when you really just want to play the game",5,Flippin' Awesome!,2007/4/10 0:00

In a futuristic world with high end weapons and armor, you're pitted against the raw muscle and razor-sharp teeth of  meat-eating dinosaurs.Really, the game is all about fun. It has nice graphics, but not nearly as stellar as other games out there. The scenery of black mountains and drifting clouds are pretty, but could be better. The character animations are all right, but sometimes clunky and clippy. The voices are all right, but sometimes get flat or cliched.When it comes down to it, this is all about pitting yourself against dinosaurs with the best weapons you could imagine from various sci-fi shows. It's you against bit, sharp-toothed monsters of gigantic proportions. They are faster than you, stronger than you, there are lots of them out there. Can you hold your own against them?The answer hopefully is yes. There are multiple levels of gameplay here, so you can start with the easier one if you haven't played these games before, or just dive into the killer-hard level if you enjoy a challenge. You'll be sneaking around, taking shelter behind jungle plants, plotting out the best place to lay your ambush.Yes, there's a plotline of sort, with crosses and double-crosses. You get your hands on various weapons. Ironically, we tended to stick just with the knife, for silent, deadly kills. The other favorite weapon was the bow with a variety of arrow types.The game is a good length and whether you enjoy it or not probably depends on whether the idea of blasting away at dinosaurs for hours is a fun thing to do. We did enjoy playing our way through it, but it was not one of the games that we kept on the active shelf to revisit for months afterwards.If you're not a dinosaur / monster-slaying fan, it might be best to rent this one for a weekend and see how it appeals to you.

One of the original launch titles way back when for the Nintendo 64, Turok enjoyed a solid series of FPS' over the next few years, and then just vanished (mainly thanks to then publisher Acclaim going under).  Well, Turok is back in action and in familiar settings, as he takes on baddies, mutants, and of course, dinosaurs.  The game gets off to a great start as you are fully engulfed in Turok's dangerous environments, but sadly it doesn't take too long to see just what all Turok has to offer.  The redundant enemies, areas, and an overall feeling of the linear are fully on display with Turok, which offers little in the way of surprises after you first put some time into the game.  Graphically speaking, Turok gets the job done, but you'll play far better looking FPS' on the XBox 360, and the texture glitches don't help the cause here either.  Flaws aside, Turok has a fair share of good points as well: the game's musical score is fantastic, there is a very nice assortment of weapons and are implemented quite well, the dinos look and sound good, and co-op and multiplayer options are solid.

Instead of being deep and rich in game play and story like a next-gen game should be we just get a generic B grade sci-fi type setting and story. The gun play varies from knifing dinos and soldiers to mounting turrets and killing a few huge bosses. The weapons are pretty cool like the plasma rifle, and mini-gun which you can set down and use it like an auto-turret.The graphics are pretty decent but rely too much on the U3 engine to make it look pretty. The story is pretty simple: You and your squad crash on a dino planet and have to get off...yeah pretty boring. While the animations for the knife kills look cool, and you can attach grenades to dinos and blow them up it gets old really fast.

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000P297F2,"Cloud ...""""",0,0,"Resident Evil 4 was kind of a strange trip in that gameplay-wise it was the funnest of the series but I find it the weakest in plot whereas the ones before it were the opposite. Umbrella Chronicles is basically the old ones combined with the action-oriented slant of 4 with rail shooting on top of it. But with Resident Evil 5 at best a good year away, Umbrella Chronicles is meant to satiate your Evil thirst for awhile and while it's probably not as amazing as the main canon games, this is probably the funnest of the offshoots.Story: Basically a retelling of Resident Evil 0, the REmake and 3 which centers on Rebecca Chambers, Jill Valentine, Chris Redfield, Billy Coen and Carlos Oliviera dealing with the horrors of zombies and other mutated creatures as they make their way through a train, a mansion and an overrun Raccoon City. We also see the mission Chris and Jill go on to rid the world of Umbrella as well as a few bonus missions.Graphics: The graphics are an example of being serviceable""; meaning they're kind of bland and not as sharply detailed as we'd want but they more than prove adequate at dealing with the enemies you'll face. The levels are recreated quite well and, although some things might be changed to make it more flowing (eg: you don't need keys to open doors anymore), the layout is quite spot-on and it was fun to see things where they should be.Sound/Music: The music at times was rather forgettable and either I tuned it out or I was busy trying to stay alive that it just floated in the background but the music's alright, it's just not hummable or anything. And the voice acting should feel familiar to people: namely its badness from its bad dialogue to its questionable voice choices (Rebecca's higher pitched voice or Wesker's overly dramatic tone like on ""TyyyyrraaaannnT!"").Gameplay: UC is basically an automated rails shooter where the nunchuk controls the direction your character is looking and the C changes your weaponry. On the Wii-mote, things are simple with B and A acting as your aiming and firing but at times I end up pressing the + button by accident but that's more controller design than anything. Pretty much the whole level can be shot up if a white crosshair shows up and it's either an enemy or in cases it's stuff to shoot so you can get a ranking (end of level rankings are based on time completed, stuff shot up, critical hits which are when you blow a zombie head off and how many files you found). They can also have things like ammo, grenades, the files or even reveal a new path.As for difficulty, it's kind of all over the place even on Easy since, while hard to actually die on Easy, certain things get annoying, namely getting that critical hit since the weak point can be so tiny that you'll either blow the head clean off or they'll just act like you shot them in the face and die anyway. Not to mention zombie heads can act bulletproof at times and full-on gunshots still have them lumbering towards you. The big thing is the boss fights who suffer from that tendency to take the bullets a little too well and some bosses seem to go on forever simply because their health doesn't drop fast enough.The surprising thing is how addicting it can be with the files taking up quite a bit of time since a certain level exists in each level (don't worry, any found gets carried over on retries so you don't have to find all of them again should you miss one), plus there's the rankings with the S class being the coveted spot and depending on your ranking, will net you stars which are used to upgrade your weapons for more firepower or greater ammo capacity. This is the kind of game you play with friends and have fun rather than the super serious stuff like the REmake where you shut off the lights and blast the sound.It's short and it's quite repetitive but replaying a level to get a better score is why this game should at least get a playthrough.""",4,3.5; Get your ya-ya's out zombie style,2007/11/26 0:00

A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000P297F2,"Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...""",3,3,"Unlike the main games of the Resident Evil series, Umbrella Chronicles"" for the Nintendo Wii is a rail shooter, not unlike House of the Dead or Time Crisis. It's not unprecedented, though; there have been several Resident Evil rail shooter games before in the form of the ""Resident Evil: Survivor"" sub-series.Umbrella Chronicles goes back to various points in the series - from Resident Evil Zero to Resident Evil 3 - revisiting scenes with established characters. The characters that can be used are dependent on what section of the story is being played. For example, in the early sections based on Resident Evil Zero, the characters from that game (Rebecca Chambers and Billy Coen) can be chosen. However, the actual characters chosen don't have a huge impact on the game, since the entire thing is done from a first-person perspective; the only attack that lets you see your character is the ""counterattack"", which is unique for each character and briefly zooms out the camera to play a short cinematic before getting back to the first-person action.The gameplay itself should be familiar to any rail shooter fan. Basically, it's a first person shooter minus the use of your legs - your character moves around automatically, and you, the player, are only responsible for shooting the things in their way. Using either the Wii remote or the Zapper accessory, the player moves the reticule around and targets enemies on the screen. There are a few different weapons in the game; the infinite-ammo handgun, the powerful but slow shotgun, the high-speed submachine gun, and the explosive grenade launcher are but some of the game's weapon types. In addition, there are two non-gun weapon types: the knife, which strikes quickly at close-range enemies, and grenades, which are limited in supply but do large amounts of damage to enemies in a wide range.Dodging enemy attacks is done through quicktime events or, in most cases, simply shooting the monster before they can get their attack off. On-screen prompts will tell to press a button or wave the Wii remote for certain types of attacks (boss attacks, enemy grapples), but most of them simply cannot be dodged unless you shoot the enemy before they can attack.Environments can be interacted with in a limited fashion. Shooting open crates will reveal items that can be picked up - weapons, ammo, health, or files. There are two kinds of health - herbs, which give immediate revival, and first-aid sprays, which act as extra lives, taking effect automatically if the player is reduced to zero health. The last interactive part of the game is doors. Some doors can be shot open to reveal alternate paths; these doors will highlight when moused over, but generally they're discovered accidentally - there's no big indicator saying ""Secret door over here."" Alternate paths have different items and monsters, so in some cases finding a secret door can be a big help.The gameplay handling is okay, but not great. There is a big discrepancy between basic zombies and other monsters that tend to have armored points and unblockable techniques. The former can be easily dispatched with a few headshots; the latter tend to require reflexes faster than actual reloading can allow for in a lot of cases. Furthermore, with the rareness of checkpoints in levels, dying can be a major setback and source of frustration.The game does feature co-op gameplay, though, which adds to its old-school appeal. Not all modes and levels support co-op, though there is an unlockable form of co-op that expands the range of levels that can be played with 2 players.The graphics and sound are hardly worth noting; neither has really improved from Gamecube incarnations of the series like Resident Evil 4 or Resident Evil Zero. They're not bad, just not particularly impressive, either. There's no really noteworthy music, and the voice acting is as hammy and overplayed as it usually is. If you don't take it seriously, the voice acting isn't too bad.As a whole, the game is kind of an annoyance to play. Despite the old-school roots, Umbrella Chronicles screws too much up to really be fun. The inclusion of co-op is nice, but there's not that much substance to the game overall. If you're an old-school rail-shooter fan, then it's all right; otherwise, there's not a lot that's new or inventive about it.6/10.""",3,Old School Rail Shooter,2008/10/21 0:00

With environments and characters straight out of previous games in the series (including the classic mansion and Raccoon City), long time fans of the series will be rejoicing at all the nostalgiac touches that populate most of The Umbrella Chronicles.  The shooting action is more than solid, and the Wii controls are quite good as well for the most part.  What hurts The Umbrella Chronicles are the repetitive moments that also populate the game, as well as graphical and character animation glitches.

While we can't use the Zapper for RE4 this sure does work. While the game is on rails and it moves around for you it makes a great cinematic experience and the difficulty stays about the same throughout but can sometimes get a bit too tough in spots.The game has you playing through important sections of previous RE games and it's a great blast to the past.

Especially the first person shooter ones such as Resident Evil: Survivor or Resident Evil: Dead Aim.  And they performed poorly with good reason.  It's nice to say that Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles isn't bad, but it would've been so much better to say it was good.Umbrella Chronicles is not entirely a new game.  It only serves to show you the downfall of Umbrella.  You'll play through Resident Evil 0, Resident Evil 1 and Resident Evil 3.  Originally, I said it was a shame that Resident Evil 2 was not included in the package.  Well, since the original review was written, Darkside Chronicles came out and it does include Resident Evil 2.  You're getting quite an adventure and a nice trip down memory lane.  A lot of the game is narrated nicely by Albert Wesker as you plow through the game.You'll have your stock of weapons and ammunition as you go through the game.  Your standard handgun has infinite ammo and can be used to take down most of your basic enemies.  You'll also pick up other weapons which do have ammunition in limited supply.  Most enemies can be taken down quite easily.  Every enemy also has a weak spot you can shoot that results in a one-hit kill.  Unfortunately, it's not easy to hit these spots.Like the Wii Edition of Resident Evil 4, Umbrella Chronicles feels natural for the Wii. It's no problem getting acquainted to the controls.  You can look around a little with the nunchuck, and you'll use the wii remote to aim and shoot at your foes.  The game is also compatible with the wii zapper.  In addition to blasting your enemies you'll also be able to use your knife by swinging the wii remote.  In short, Umbrella Chronicles is easy to pick up and play.  The overall adventure isn't too hard either.You'll have some fun with the game because its really simple stuff, but it feels a lot like the House of the Dead arcade shooters.  In a sense, it feels very empty at times.  You have enemies coming at you left and right, but the gameplay eventually turns into something repetitive.  Throughout the adventure it just feels like something more could've been done with the game.  More variety in the gameplay would've been nice.  It's fun at first but there's just not enough thrown at you.  There are moments where you're reflexes will be tested and you'll have to shake the wii remote or press certain buttons.  This'll keep you on your toes, but it's still not enough to drive past the fact that the game grows repetitive really fast.Perhaps the most striking aspect of Umbrella Chronicles is that it simply could've been a better looking game.  The environments have the look of Resident Evil, but the textures are not all that smooth.  It doesn't look bad, but it certainly needed a bit of a polish to make it look better.The music is a little strange.  It's this aspect that doesn't make the game feel like Resident Evil.  The music doesn't carry that eerie tone.  It's not bad, though.  For the most part it has a good soundtrack but you can't help but think that you're playing a game that looks like Resident Evil but feels like something else.Umbrella Chronicles isn't a bad game by any means.  But it sure isn't good either.

What's so cool about the controls is that you can now control where the gun goes via the Wii mote and you control Leon/Ashley/Ada with the C stick. This makes aiming so much easier than the gamepad. You can now use your knife with a quick swipe of the Wiimote or you can still do it the hard way.My favorite feature is that RE4 uniquely uses the Wiimote's bult in speaker. When you blow up heads, reload, shoot, jump, it all goes through the speaker and it sounds great. Capcom really put effort into this port and tried making it somewhat different.

A2582KMXLK2P06,B000P46NKC,B. E Jackson,19,11,"After thoroughly playing through Resident Evil 2 and 3, I finally arrived to the overwhelmingly popular Resident Evil 4. I've read the positive reviews. I pumped myself up for all sorts of incredible mind-boggling graphics and animations to excite me like never before... and I can honestly say the previous Resident Evil games gave me a lot more satisfaction overall.Now, the graphics are truly memorable with every twist and turn your main character Leon faces. It makes the older Resident Evil games show their age. Throughout the game, many of these twisted-looking mutants will walk up to you in an attempt to kill you. Because the game is pretty easy, and because the game is mainly focused on nonstop shooting action, taking out the bad guys hardly ever becomes a problem. Most of them will die in just one or two hits from the shotgun. There's almost no challenge at all here. You can argue that the same sort of gameplay takes place in Resident Evil 2 and 3 (where a bunch of zombies slowly walk in your direction and you have to take them out one by one) but many of those zombies require a fairly decent amount of ammo to completely kill.In Resident Evil 2 and 3, you'd be shooting at a bunch of zombies and quite often it all became too much to handle and the zombies would eventually overpower you. Nothing like that in this game, because you can see them coming ahead of time.  That really hurts the gameplay.I hate how the dreary, quiet and almost shockingly life-like atmosphere of the previous Resident Evil games has been removed, with Capcom choosing to instead make a nonstop action shooter with loads and loads of bad guys frequently entering the picture. I admit that it looks pretty cool how you first see a shadow of a figure walking in your direction, and then it appears *right* in front of you a few seconds later. I can't complain about the graphics because they really *are* a sight to behold. But I can complain about the lack of a creepy atmosphere.  It would have made the game better, in my opinion.In Resident Evil 4, it seems like the game encourages one-hit kills, and honestly, most shooting games I've played that had one-hit kills only happened because of some cheat code I activated. In Resident Evil 4, it really *is* a simple game with Leon only needing to waste a couple bullets for each of the mutants he faces.I also really hate how there's hardly any freedem whatsoever to the areas you explore and walk through. There's one narrow path that you mindlessly follow for pretty much the entire game. It reminds me *so much* of the old Playstation classic Dino Crisis 2. However, back then walking down a small path wasn't considered much of a problem because the PSX hardware was pretty limited in those days. With the Playstation 2 and Gamecube, there's really no excuse for a crammy environment. Improving technology was supposed to eliminate this problem.  Maybe they will fix it when Resident Evil 5 finally arrives.I also hate the little things such as the sound your shotgun makes when it fires. It has a weak, quiet sound which isn't nearly as cool as the shotgun you found in Resident Evil 2.  Remember that gun? It made an exploding sound when fired. The death animations from the bad guys is pretty spectacular at first.  However, after about 20 minutes you begin to see them repeating the same death sequences over and over again, and that makes the game lose its impressiveness. Some of them stagger around before falling over dead, while others spin around. It gets old quick.  You can also aim for the face of a mutant and their head will explode.  It's not as cool as in Resident Evil 2 when their head actually blows to pieces, though.Most of the time the enemies don't make much noise after they've been shot. They're surprisingly quiet.  They mostly make a quiet aw"" sound and then fall over dead. A far cry from the unsettling moaning sounds from the zombies in the previous RE games on the Playstation.Throwing in a money feature was a bad idea, too. You can find money in these white crates sitting on shelves (in which you have to shoot to discover the money). Also money can be found from enemies after you've killed them. Money is used to buy better weapons from a merchant who occasionally appears on screen. Now I ask you, wouldn't it have been *really* awful had the previous Resident Evil games thrown this feature into the gameplay? The Resident Evil series is supposed to be about blowing apart undead zombies and making it out alive with the limited amount of bullets you are given. Once you waste those bullets and can't find anymore lying around, it's safe to say you blew it- you have to start the game over again. This is a GOOD thing because it increases the challenge. Now, you can just buy whatever you want when the going gets tough.  It just LOOKS strange collecting money in a Resident Evil game.The music is pretty unspectacular as well. I never once got the sense I was going to die because I was too busy mindlessly shooting my way through a narrow path and killing the same enemies time and time again in order to make my way to the next area... and then blaze my way through THAT part of the game. Repeat over and *over* again. The gameplay never changed. Some of the bosses were awesome, though. Those boss fights were the high point to an otherwise overrated and challenge-free game.The Wii version of the game is definitely the best, with the new control system and the updated graphics enhancing the experience. I just wish that during the creation of this game, Capcom had focused more on atmosphere and the ""occasional"" shooting instead of seemingly never-ending shooting. That way, you'd feel scared the entire way *and* you'd appreciate shooting the bad guys when the moment finally came. So much action is involved in Resident Evil 4 that you *really* stop taking notice of the fact that killing something is supposed to be a special moment in a video game when the time to do so finally arrives. You'll just be shooting your way through the game, collecting money and upgrading weapons, and repeating the same thing over and over again.  Resident Evil 4 takes about 3 hours to complete, and that's what you'll be doing for the majority of the time.Honestly, the gameplay doesn't feel much different from Medal of Honor (despite being a 3rd person shooter). I think we've finally arrived to a point when all action/shooters are starting to feel the same. When game companies update graphics, the control system and gameplay, they're actually accidentally removing some of the supposed flaws that make games special in the first place. People might look at the graphics in Resident Evil 2 and complain about the muddy and grainy appearance, but at least there's nothing else like it out there (well, besides Resident Evil 3).I say skip Resident Evil 4 and just play the old games instead. The updated graphics and enemy animations are only interesting for a little while and then the experience wears off.  I've actually stopped buying new video games for over six years because I began to notice a horrible trend in that all video games are starting to blend together and feel pretty much the same.  After playing Resident Evil 4, I think there's some truth to that.  Graphics don't always equal long-lasting fun.My biggest complaint however, is that the challenge increases by itself. This means there's no way to master the gameplay, and mastering the gameplay is exactly why I play video games in the first place. You see depending on how well you do in one room will determine the challenge in the *next* room. So if you blaze through one hallway and don't get hit at all, suddenly the next hallway will be loaded with hyperactive and exceptionally deadly bad guys that are not only more aggressive, but your health bar will decrease even more upon every hit you receive. This happens *the entire way through the game*. Death is now VERY likely to happen when you're caught off-guard by numerous and well-timed cheap shots on the part of the enemy.*Why hasn't anyone realized this?* I've posted on Resident Evil 4 message boards and nobody believes me. They just assume I'm trashing the game and flaming the boards in an attempt to get a rise out of people. I don't think so. This is a joke- an unfunny, terrible joke. Actually it's a major gameplay flaw. I don't want the game to increase the challenge for me depending on my skills- I want more aggressive enemies when *I* select a higher difficulty setting. If I were to choose a hyper or insane mode, yeah, this kind of thing would be totally appropriate. But not a normal run on normal mode. Oh well, some people don't care about this but it's a really big deal to me.It's NOT just regular stage enemies either. Bosses will suddenly make you pay hard and heavy when the game realizes how easy you're breezing through the rooms and hallways, the quick commands will be even more demandingly quicker (such as that dreaded knight room with Ashley or during any boss fight that requires shaking the Wii remote to avoid sudden danger). Fail to shake the remote in time and you WILL experience a sudden and surprising death.Let me give you an example- let's say you're almost dead and playing poorly, when the time comes to shake the remote you will be given 2-3 seconds. However if you're blazing through the game without taking a single hit, you're given half a second to shake the remote. Don't shake it in time and guess what? Death! Unbelievable. This wouldn't be a serious problem if it wasn't for the fact that many times the boss fights *themselves* require shaking the Wii remote which means if you're not fast enough to execute the shake, all that work wearing down the boss will be gone in an instant and you'll be dead meat.Any and all cheap ways that the game can take advantage of will be used against you depending on your performance in the previous room so the best advice? Play like crap. Take several hits. Allow enemies to throw weapons at your face. Allow them to grab you. Heal often. Shoot sloppily. Shoot enemies once or twice and allow them to recover and attack you. Pace yourself. Running hard seems to encourage your enemies to run faster. Does any of this seem fair? Of course not. Simply put, the game punishes you for performing well. Yes my friends, this really IS a twisted, terrible joke. Play Resident Evil 2 and 3 instead where absolutely *none* of this crap occurs.To be fair, clearing out an entire room without taking any hits doesn't *always* create a sudden jump in difficulty. Sometimes it takes 2 or 3 rooms of flawless or near flawless work for the challenge to magically go up. It always does eventually though- *always*. I've played through RE4 15 times at least and studied the gameplay carefully so I know something is not right.Now in my opinion, this isn't fair at *all*. It would only be fair if there was some kind of extremely hard or hyper difficulty setting and I was playing the game on that but... I'm not. I'm playing the game on normal mode. I don't get it!But do NOT go over to any number of Resident Evil 4 message boards and explain this to people. Nobody will believe you. Plus you'll get flamed. I'm not *always* a clueless idiot even if I might act like one sometimes! I know something is fishy about RE4's gameplay. I just can't put my finger on the exact problem and what's causing this (and if there's a way to stop it from happening because it completely ruins the fun for me).""",2,an average game with a big problem,2007/7/21 0:00
A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000P46NKC,"Cloud ...""""",1,0,"For the longest time, I wasn't that into Resident Evil. I have vague memories of playing 2 and 3 but for some reason, I didn't get into them the way I did Final Fantasy and Zelda. The original release of Resident Evil 4 on the Gamecube sort of brought me back, not because I finally rediscovered the series but rather there was just simply nothing else out there. Well now it's back on the Wii and it actually makes what was a great experience on the Gamecube even better with a much better emphasis on control and aiming and since the game was a good play anyway, it's a worthy purchase.Story: Taking place 6 years after the incident in Raccoon City (depicted in RE 2 and 3), former police officer Leon Kennedy is on a mission to rescue the President's daughter Ashley Graham who's been recently kidnapped. But getting in was fairly easy while finding her and getting the two of you out alive is another story as there's strange villagers and bizarre creatures out to make sure you don't leave.Graphics: While it doesn't push the Wii to its limits the way the Gamecube one did, this edition is just as impressive with detailed character models and physics as well as superb use of lighting and fog to help create the mood. Also, since the series is finally in full 3D, there's more depth to the environment and while occasionally a blurry texture will show up, it's still looks as good as it did.Sound/Music: The series has always been about B-movie dialogue and like voice acting and with such lines as you're small time!"" and ""you're right hand comes off?"" complete with typo, it's always strange playing a RE game with great atmosphere and tension yet it has the most laughable of plot presentation. The music is a bit different as well since some of it, namely the more action-y theme when things get hectic is meant to get your heart racing whereas before it had more of an ambient feel to it.Gameplay: Pretty much everything's the same since the GC/PS2 ones came out. With the camera behind Leon the entire time instead of preset angles, the game has a pseudo-FPS feel to it that feels more natural and while running-while-shooting mechanics would be much welcome one day, you never feel like you can't hit enemies like the old days because your aim was off. And with the action being amped with plenty of ammo and naturally, plenty of enemies, the new gameplay style as well as the Wii controls make it more enjoyable to play. My one complaint is that while ammo is plentiful, other things are not such as grenades. Always useful with scores of enemies, at times they seemed like there wasn't enough and since enemies don't always die when shot in the head or even quite a few chest shots, it's annoying for crowd control.As far as the actual game itself, it's more intense than creepy since you'll find yourself getting adrenaline-pumped and antsy in new areas but after awhile, it feels kind of, I don't know, same-y? When you reach a whole new area halfway a good chunk in the game and have a whole new area to explore, it feels somewhat stretched out and it almost kills the pacing. Puzzles are thankfully not as oddball and out-of-place (seriously, who builds a room with enclosing walls inside a mansion?) with really the only puzzles coming from equipment management. For the first time, the weapons can be upgraded with features such as firepower, capacity and reload time being available to be ""tuned up"" so you have to wonder...is it better to save my money knowing a better gun will be on sale soon or upgrade my lowly shotgun then sell it at a high price later? Luckily, your enemies apparently are rich buggers so money usually isn't an issue.With Assignment Ada, Separate Ways and the popular Mercenaries plus the main game, there's very little reason to not buy the Wii edition of probably one of the better games to get for the Wii.""",5,One of the Wii's finest titles,2007/6/29 0:00

After getting my Wii I decided to replay this great game.  The adaptation for the Wii controler makes the game a little easier to play through than on the other cnosoles.

AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000P46NKC,"N. Durham Big Evil""""",34,26,"Resident Evil 4 was a departure for Capcom's influential survival horror series in terms of gameplay and style, and it worked for the better to say the least.  Originally released on the Gamecube, and later the PS2, Resident Evil 4 was undoubtedly the best game in the franchise, and one of the best games ever made for either system as well.  Now Capcom has ported the game to the Wii, and be glad they did.  Everything that made Resident Evil 4 so good the first time around is here in spades, along with the additional features from the PS2 version (including Assignment Ada) and a new control scheme taking advantage of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk.  Playing as Leon, the survivor of Resident Evil 2, you are on a hunt for the President's missing daughter in a Spanish village.  Things aren't as they seem however as the blood thirsty townspeople begin to attack, with even bigger (and boy do I mean bigger) developments to come as well.  If by some odd reason you have never played Resident Evil 4 before, you have been missing out to say the least.  The overall ultra creepy atmosphere is retained, and the game still looks, sounds, and plays as superb as it has before.  The control scheme really makes taking down enemies easier than before, as the laser sight from your weapon is done away with and replaced with a sight using the Wii Remote to pump bullets into your enemies.  The Nunchuk is used to move Leon around, and it works flawlessly.  The only real downpoint of the Wii Edition of Resident Evil 4 is that there is no brand new content made specifically for the new release.  However, this is only a minor complaint at best considering the relatively cheap price tag to go along with one of the best games to be conceived in the past few years.  All in all, whether or not you have played Resident Evil 4 before at any great length, it is definitely worth playing once again for the Wii.  And if you have never played Resident Evil 4 before, consider this the definitive version of a classic masterpiece of modern gaming.",5,Everything old is new again,2007/6/20 0:00

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000P46NKC,S. Rhodes,319,307,"In January of 2005, Resident Evil 4 hit the scene.  Since it's release it has already gone on to be labeled as one of the greatest games of all time.  It redefined not only Resident Evil, but the action genre as a whole.  The game was originally meant to be a Gamecube exclusive, but found its way to the PS2 later in October 2005.  It then had another release on the PC.  Now it comes to the Wii.  If you've got a Wii and you for some reason haven't played Resident Evil 4, then this is probably the best version yet.In case you don't know the story, Resident Evil 4 follows Leon S. Kennedy, a former RPD police officer trying to forget the horrors of Raccoon City.  He now works as an agent for the President.  The President's daughter has been kidnapped, and it's up to Leon to rescue her.  Yet when he arrives to the location there's something weird about the locals.  Leon will quickly discover that there are indeed things much worse than being mauled by zombies.Most gamers are aware of Resident Evil 4's greatness, but it never hurts to go through it again.  Resident Evil 4 sports some of the best gameplay in the entire series.  Instead of a fixed camera, it follows Leon around and you see things from over his shoulder.  This means Resident Evil 4 was the first Resident Evil to go fully 3D and it works out just fine.  The environments are fantastic looking, with even the tiniest things given details.  Even two years later, the game still looks absolutely fantastic.  There are even some XBOX360 games that don't give this kind of attention to detail.  There are no frame rate issues and no horrific load times.  Best of all, the game remains a good challenge.When it comes to the Gameplay of Resident Evil 4, however, the Wii is a completely different experience.  At first it was hard not to be a little nervous about the controls.  Just about every game ported to the Wii has had control issues.  Surprisingly, Resident Evil 4 does not.  The Wii controls are excellent.  Nearly flawless.  You'll use the nunchuck to run around, and the Wii remote serves as your gun.  In the interactive cutscenes, you'll use the wii remote and nunchuck to do things like dodge when the game says dodge.  Or when the game tells you you'll need to cut the rope after the first boss for instance, you'll use the wii remote to cut the rope.  At first you might think these Wii Controls are all tacked on, but in the end it makes Resident Evil 4 a completely different experience altogether, and once you get adjusted to them, you'll wonder how you ever did without them.  Even if you've played through the Gamecube or Playstation 2 versions, you might want to give the Wii version a shot just because of the controls alone.If I had any real criticism regarding the control scheme, it would be that Leon doesn't turn automatically when you aim the remote to the far left or far right of the screen (like how the main character turns in Red Steel).  Instead you have to turn him using the nunchuck.  There will be plenty of moments where you'll take damage unfairly.  Even worse, you may get confused if games like Red Steel have you used to that sort of thing.  This can also make some boss battles harder than they have to be.  Clearly Capcom was aware that the controls would take a moment to get used to as bosses are not nearly as tough as they were in the other versions of the game.  Anyone who mastered the Gamecube or PS2 version will find the Wii version to be fairly easy.  In fact, it even feels as though the difficulty has been taken down a notch.If the Wii Remote controls aren't working for you or you want to play the traditional way, the game supports the Classic Controller, and that's just cool if you want other options.The Wii version has no additional extras, however.  This may disappoint a few gamers.  It includes all the extras of the PS2 version at least, but it's a little disappointing that aside from the Wii Controls, Capcom didn't put in any other extras exclusive to the Wii version at all.The game sounds about the same as it did on the Gamecube.  In terms of the technological aspects of the game, it's a direct port here.  All the voice acting and dialog is the same, and it still sounds good.The only really major problem with Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition is simple: It's another port.  The controls here work well, though, but it's the fact that this is the fourth time the game has been released.  In all honesty how any people haven't played the game yet that want to?  Even with the fantastic Wii controls and affordable price it's going to be hard to tell those who own the Gamecube or PS2 versions to get this one.  Even if the Wii Controls make the game a completely different experience, it's still the same game that was released in 2005.Pros:+Fantastic Gameplay+Pretty good storyline overall+Good voice acting' music and sound effects+The game still looks incredible+All the Playstation 2 extras are here+A flawless port, no framerate issues or load time issues whatsoever+The Wii Controls are almost flawless+The classic controller is available for those who don't want to use the Wii Remote and NunchuckCons:-No Wii Exclusive extras-The game is slightly easier-It's the fourth version of Resident Evil 4.  If you've already got the PS2 or Gamecube version of the game you'll have to ask yourself if the Wii controls really justify another buy.  It's a completely different experience, but what it really boils down to is that it is STILL the same game you got back in 2005.",5,Reinventing Evil,2007/6/19 0:00

Isaac, a technician, is tasked to help repair a planet cracker, a massive mining ship. Once aboard, their craft is shortly destroyed, and they find themselvse trapped on a ship filled with monstrous conversions of the crew.Sound: 11/10. This is where the game makes its biggest bang. The environmentals are so good that you'll be grateful when you see a monster. The sound of clattering pipes, venting steam, shorting circuits, all so innocuous, yet they manage to create the lions share of the feel. The music is barely secondary to it, helping only to accentuate it.Graphics: 9/10. Very few bad things can be said about the visuals of this game. The walls and environs are placed and unique. The graffiti is humourous and usnettling in turns. The only flaws deals with interactions and backgrounds, allowing pieces to fall or tumble through, though this is rare.Gameplay: 9/10. Combat is pleasantly creative, with psionic abilities in the place of industrial equipment, and welders and repair gear as the weaponry. There are very few actual military pieces, with the exception of the pulse rifle. Inventroy is well set up and challenging to juggle. Make sure to download the free Obsidian Suit, which will make life far simpler. The HUD design used in this is also incredibly creative, and a cheery, bright counterpoint to the blood and death.Story: 9/10. The premise is well thought out, and makes sense in context. The story is peeled back like layers of an onion. Theres enough facts and logs placed around that can fill the gaps, but leave the main storyline vague, which as everyone knows, makes for better horror than nailing down every nuance and detail.Only a handful of drawbacks exist. The store"" is oddly placed, and an unusual setup, considering most 7-11's don't sell military hardware. The bodies are static, meaning that when you walk through one, it bursts like an over ripe fruit, and results in a game of kick the head, which follows for quite a distance if you can't walk around it. The HUD, whose praises I was just singing, is next to impossible to read in some circumstances.Overall, the game is one of the best horror adventure games ever made, on the level of the original Silent Hill and Resident Evil, and will make you jump or start with fright, and set your heart racing with nothing more than the sound of a dropping pipe.""",5,"Dark, terrifying, and bloody",2008/10/16 0:00
A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000QY9C90,"Cloud ...""""",3,1,"One thing that I try to do whenever a new game is coming out is generally try to avoid any articles, gameplay footage and press before a game's release since inevitably I'll read too much into it and be disappointed. Instead, it's better to walk into a game, movie or CD fresh and free of preconceptions and just let the game does what it does rather than what you want it to do and that's what Left 4 Dead did for me. While Portal is one of my favorite games ever, I have to say I'm only a marginal fan of the Half-Life series so I figured well, brand new Xbox 360, 2 years worth of games to try out, why not start with a new one?"" and so we have this incredibly fun shooter that has an incredibly satisfying whole though strangely, nitpick-worthy parts.Story: No real ""story"" here, just 4 scenarios themed as a B-movie event with 4 survivors: Zoey, a college student and horror movie lover, Bill, a war veteran, Louis, a desk worker for an IT company and Francis, a tattoo-sporting biker. The 4 have to make it through various locales such as an airport, the countryside or a hospital as they battle wave upon wave (upon wave) of zombies.Graphics: Like Epic Games and their Unreal Engine, Valve continually uses the Source Engine which has received improvements with each game they use with it and one thing they changed was lighting which has been considerably updated since Half-Life 2's Ravenwood level and now the moodiness, the flashlight and atmosphere has been refined to really make you feel you're in a spooky B-movie. Another is the crowd and when you see more than 2 dozen incoming zombies running at you, that ""oh........****"" feeling creeps in.Sound/Music: The music of course is appropriately moody and creepy and meant to create an almost atonal ambience similar to Resident Evil games and it works quite well though in order to hear Live chatter, I had to turn it down (I use headphones) but I like its use. Voice acting is sort of a weird mixed bag in that the characters are voiced very well and I never despised that one character for bad lines however those lines will be repeated quite frequently and ""Reloading!"" or ""Cover me while I heal"" will pop up on more than one time.Gameplay: While you can play single player with competent though not altogether useful AI players, it's best to go on Xbox Live or system link/split screen and play that way since it's incredibly fun and while the scenarios aren't plentiful in choices, I found it fun to just go through the levels anyway. There's not a whole lot here to learn with your D-pad providing various item uses with Up (flashlight), Right (med pack with LT to heal teammate, RT to heal yourself), Down (Pain pills) and Left (grenades which are either Pipe Bombs that beep which zombies flock to or molotov cocktails to create some flamage). Weapons come from pistols that have unlimited ammo with a second pistol being able to be found and for bigger firepower we have Shotgun, Assault Rifles and Sniper. Located within each scenario are Safe Rooms which upon closed provide a checkpoint as well as ammo and weapon replenishing and also revive dead teammates.Now since it is zombies, you're thinking it's just going to be those 28 Weeks Later-esque zombies that strictly run right? Nope, we have different classes from boomers (big fat guys that vomit goo on you which makes zombie flock to you specifically), smokers which can latch onto you with a looooong tongue and incapacitate you unless you're saved by a teammate, hunters who act like jumping cats that pounce on you from afar to the big burly Tanks. The creepy ones coming from Witches; what sounds like a crying girl turns out to be a one-hit kill beast for anyone who disturbs her so it's best to avoid her unless you want one of the achievements. Versus mode allows you to play as the survivors or the zombies and let's just say smashing through stuff as a tank is bad*** incarnate. The one fault in the Versus mode is that while playing as the undead is fun, your bullet-taking capacity is abysmal and many times you'll be dead before you even get to have fun and have to wait 20 seconds to respawn. I understand at least wanting to give survivors a chance to win but come on, that's just silly.Not wanting to have 4 repeated scenarios with the same encounter each time, Valve brought in the ""Director"" which essentially acts as a zombie button where it sends enemies to you depending on your progress so whereas on one scenario, I had to stop an invading horde from behind, in a subsequent playthrough they were nowhere to be found. And while it is fun to constantly be on your toes, the level design itself is pretty much set in place and what would've made it fun is if the level itself changed in each playthrough such as a cave-in prompting another way around or an explosion blocking an exit but that's not here so Left 4 Dead is insanely fun when you don't think about the small details.If you can get the game as a deal, go for it since it's one of the more enjoyable surprises on the 360 so far. But for a full 70 buck purchase, it feels like the amount of stuff to do would be a factor if it wasn't for the fun that outweights it but however you get it, play it.""",5,"Look Ma, I'm a B-movie zombie killer superstar",2008/11/27 0:00

Your character (who can be lit on fire, survive explosions, fall from heights if you can without grabbing a ledge mid flight and be shot insane amounts of times with buckshot before dying) just lies there like a 10 year old girl and gets owned by the special infected.....it's pathetic and makes the game needlessly frustrating.

I usually just gun them down and take their health packs when I need one, or they steal them using means beyond physics.  The harder the difficulty the more useless they are.  This game also has hovering molotov cocktails. If a horde is running at you and you throw one into it, the molotov will hover for a few seconds before exploding, ensuring any special infected are safly away from it and that your surrounded by zombies"" taking damaged before the fire kills anything.  I put zombies in quotes because these zombies don't eat people they simply pummel you to death with punches and kicks.  Left 4 Dead also has bloodthursty fire, yes anytime you blow up a gas can or throw a molotov the fire chases you, even sometimes when it's invisible it still damages you, maybe it's infected too?  The DLC was a total joke and made Valve look tired and lazy.  Survival mode sucks, you get a tiny blocked off part of a level already in the game, a crappy tiny lighthouse level all of which have an instant finale with endless ownage with baddies raining from the sky until you die.  Millions of Zombies, multiple hunters, multiple smokers, multiple tanks raining down on you until your dead.....wow so much fun to die in 1-3 mins in a tiny locked area when every special infected can one shot you.  The PC version actually has new campagins made by fans since Valve is too lazy to make them.  L4D II still has no dlc with valve again saying on the games release that they would support the games with dlc. L4D ii was a major step down from l4d which is flawed and glitched beyond logic itself.  If you want a real zombie game Killing Floor is the way to go its eons better and tripwire fully supports their games with new dlc regularly unlike valve which give you one extra short map and that's it.  Also no monster or zombie can rape you simply by touching you in KF when you have full health you can go down fighting. In l4d you sit there crying for useless clepto AI players to save you while they watching you die while gorging on health packs and pills.  This is a pathetic, retardedly glitched, broken, frustrating piece of garbage....trust be get Killing Floor.  L4D 2 builds on the same problems but just adds more special infected that only need to touch you once coupled with endless larger hordes....it's virtually unplayable.  L4D 2 is simply a 60 dollar update that should have been part of L4D 1 but valve say fit to abandon L4D after 1 half assed tiny DLC patch.""",1,"Love zombie movies, games, but this sucks.",2009/1/22 0:00

Now, thanks to Valve, we get what is possibly the most fun zombie apocalypse to grace the world of video games.  Left 4 Dead allows you to play as either a human survivor taking out hordes of the undead, or as a flesh-hungry zombie coordinating attacks to feast on your prey.  Whichever role you choose, Left 4 Dead is a fun and frantic blast to play, with some of the best multiplayer offerings around today.  Seriously, with a few pals in tow, the Versus and other multiplayer options are reason enough to pick this game up for alone.  The single-player campaign is fun and plenty enjoyable, but the real star of the show is the game's multiplayer capabilities.  The game looks and sounds spectacular, controls wonderfully, and offers enough challenge and variation to keep you coming back again and again.  If there's any drawbacks to Left 4 Dead, it's that there are only four campaign maps, but it doesn't take away from the fact that the game is an absolute blast.  All in all, if multiplayer and/or zombie gaming is your thing in the least, Left 4 Dead is wholeheartedly worth your time and attention.",5,A sheer blast,2008/11/25 0:00
ADPEAVHFCNLLC,B000QY9C90,Poisoned Blade,1,0,"Left 4 Dead is the best zombie apocalypse game to date.  It borrows heavily from movies like 28 Days Later and Zach Snyder's Dawn of the Dead.  By borrowing heavily, I mean that if they changed the title screen and the name of the game to 28 Days Later"", it would be a really good movie game.  The city is overrun with fast zombies and a band of four Survivors must brave the zombie infested areas to reach a Safe House.  The Xbox Live Modes are really fun, but the Single Player Campaign is repetitive and only 4 hours long.Gameplay:  8/10You must battle your way through the hordes of zombies as a team.  Each Character carries a pistol with unlimited ammo and one of the following; a machine gun, shotgun, or rifle.  Pipe Bombs, Molotov Cocktails, and Exploding Canisters can be found if you explore the levels.  Characters also carry a Health Pack that can be used to heal yourself or a wounded ally.  Some Zombies can quickly incapacitate a Survivor and their teammates must rush to their rescue.  Without teamwork, you're pretty much dead.Every time you play a level, the zombies and the massive 100 zombie rushes are in different areas.  As a team, you must quickly find the best defensible position and survive the onslaught.  You've really got to use your environment to your advantage.  Defending a hallway is much easier than an open area.  Closing doors also helps you because it takes the zombies a few seconds to break them down.  Shooting destructible fuel canisters explode into a wall of fire.  Working as a team to survive the frantic zombie ambushes is the best part of this game.Single Player:  4/10The Entire Single Player Campaign is made up of 4 Missions composed of 5 Levels each.  Each Level can be finished in 10-15 minutes.  You can finish everything in 4 hours.  What hurts the Campaign is that all of the Mission Objectives, Weapons, Enemies, and Gameplay Mechanics are identical.  If you've played one Campaign, you've played them all.  The only difference in the Campaigns is the level layout and the art.  In every Mission, you play along 3 AI Controlled Allies, but even after 2 hours, the game already starts to feel repetitive.Multi-Player: 8/10In Multi-Player, you can form your group of Survivors with 1-3 friends and play the game.  This plays exactly like the Single Player Mode, but it's more frantic because you really need to coordinate your efforts when the zombies attack.  4 Players can also play as the Special Infected:  There's a Boomer that vomits zombie attracting barf on party members, a Hunter that pounces on victims, a Smoker that has a 50 foot tongue and can drag Survivors away from the group, and a TANK, which is a hulk-like behemoth with a lot of Hit Points and Damage.  Scrambling to safety as a team is a blast and ambushing the Survivors is also great fun.  When the Survivors reach their destination, the teams switch and the level repeats.  Although this mode is great, there are some drawbacks.  The game only keeps score of the Survivors, so if you play as the Infected, you have no idea how you did.  Also, when you spawn as an Infected, the game chooses which creature you must be.  You don't get to select this.  If you are killed, you take a ""time out"" for about 15 seconds before you can respawn again.  Hopefully, they'll add more types of Infected and allow you to choose in the sequel.Art:  6/10The art isn't going to win any beauty contests here.  The game was made with the Counterstrike Source Engine and looks outdated.  The Cutscenes are lacking and the load screens are generic.  The Production Value just isn't here.Sound:  8/10The music is creepy and the sound effects really add to the atmosphere.  Hearing what lurks around the corner really keeps you on edge.Overall:  6/10The weak Single Player Campaign and limited Online Modes prevent this game from reaching it's full potential.  The game is arguably the best 'zombie apocalypse' game to date, but it feels limited.  With only 6 weapons, 6 enemy types, and cookie cutter level design Left 4 Dead feels like half a game.The game is rated Mature for Language, Violence, and Gore.Buy it if you want a fun Cooperative Xbox Live Game or you're dying to play a game that feels like 28 Days Later.Rent it if you want to blow through the Single Player Campaign in 4 hours, and try out the Xbox Live Gameplay.Avoid it if you don't intend to play it on Xbox Live.If you like this game, check out Resident Evil 5!""",3,"Like a One-Armed Zombie, this Game Feels Incomplete.",2009/7/15 0:00
A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B000QY9C90,"Richard Baker BinaryMessiah""""",1,1,"The Good: Gorgeous sound and visuals, great characters, realistic looking zombies, powerful weapons, addictive online multiplayer, a true zombie simulatorThe Bad: Lacks content, very short, not so fun offline, not much story except the intro movieOnce again Valve brings us another great game using their Source engine that brings all the elements of Left 4 Dead to life (or death???) The first thing you'll notice (mainly Valve fans) is that the Source engine has had a next-gen upgrade (even more so than Portal) and everything looks amazing. While HL2 fans will notice some sounds and elements of the engine from those games it doesn't really bother you. The game looks stunning with excellent lighting effects, awesome AI (enemy and friendly), great character models, hi-res textures, and just everything you'd expect out of the Source engine. L4D, however, isn't really a single player only experience; in fact you won't even see the full potential of this four player game unless you play online.The game is comprised of four campaigns and each campaign has five levels. Each level gets longer and more and more difficult with a final level where you have to face off hundreds of zombies until your rescue transport arrives. At the start of each campaign you get to choose of the four characters (each character just starts out with a different weapon). Speaking of weapons I was disappointed in the small selection that there was (just pistols, shotguns, machine guns, and a sniper rifle along with bombs and molotovs). The basic idea is these four characters have to cover each others' butts through these levels while you face off massive hordes of zombies. The whole idea is a bit more in depth with some gameplay elements thrown in there. For example zombies are attracted to noise and light, so if you keep your flashlight on near zombies they'll charge after you. Shoot a car that has it's headlights on and you'll have to face off dozens of zombies charging at you because you set off the car alarm. Killing these zombies is fairly easy since a few shots will bring them down, but its sheer numbers that makes up for this.There are over 150 different zombie types, but there are a few special"" zombies that are harder to take down. These are the Tanks (massive zombies that will take all four people to bring down), Smokers (these guys have super long tongues that snatch you up), Boomers (no not like in Gears of War if these guys vomit on you they attract more zombies and same if you blow them up if they're too close to you), Witches (you hear them cry through levels and if you disturb them they'll take you down and you are down until someone revives you), Hunters (which are super fast moving zombies that pounce on you and eat you until someone saves you). This changes gameplay up along with certain sections require you to do something such as hit this switch to move this and while this is happening you have to fend off hordes of zombies. The game is probably the only ""zombie simulator"" out there because they just act and look so real and you really do feel helpless in the middle of nowhere with hundreds of zombies around you.Of course you'll blow through the four campaigns in about 3-4 hours, but it's the great online play that extends the replay value. The way levels are played out are very original as well since you have to get everyone into a ""safe room"" at the end of the level (look for the red door) and close it thus the next level loads and you get to restock on health and ammo. Throughout levels you may find rare ammo stocks, pipe bombs etc. It's the final levels that really are hard since you have to fend off so many zombies and this can be hard in single player since the AI won't go anywhere unless you do. When your transport arrive you MUST start heading towards it before it gets to you because if you're surrounded by dozens of zombies you're dead. If your team mates die they tend to respawn in closets or behind closed doors. Once you run out of health you can be healed by other team mates or take pills to temporarily fill your health. L4D is a wonderful game, but it's tight on content and lacks more maps that we need (Valve sucks when it comes to DLC). I highly recommend this game for a great online multiplayer game.""",4,The game that started it all,2012/3/28 0:00
A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000QY9C90,S. Rhodes,4,3,"In horror and in thrills, zombies have always been popular.  From fine cinema to the video game.  Left 4 Dead is nothing new or original.  It's a game about Zombie Apocalypse.  Yet it's very well crafted and fun.  If you love Zombies, then Left 4 Dead is going to really keep you on your toes.There's no story here.  You play as one of four characters who are trying to survive the apocalypse.  And that's all your goal is throughout the campaign.  Of course, there's no way survival will be easy with zombies and other monsters coming at you from all directions.  There are plenty of weapons to find and ammunition is plentiful.  What makes the game hard is how fast you can be overcome by your adversaries, despite having plenty of weapons and ammo.  Your health will dwindle quite fast throughout Left 4 Dead.  On the other hand, things aren't always over when your health runs out.  You'll be incapacitated when your health depletes and be restricted from moving.  You can, however, shoot when you are on the ground.  Your allies can always come and revive you so that you can get going.  Even if you succumb to the enemy and die permanently, you can hope that your allies will find you as a survivor and you can jump back into the game.Going about the campaign with actual humans is much more fun than AI.  Mostly because you can set up better strategies and because the AI tends to get into a lot more trouble than is worth saving them from.  There's a lot of fun to be had from all the weapons and explosives you can pick up and toss at your enemies.  You and your allies will be on your toes for the entire campaign.The only real problem with the campaign is that it's really short.  Normally this would be a big problem for a game.  With Left 4 Dead, however, it's a plus.  The campaign is never the same thing twice.  You'll experience enemies in different locations every time, and you'll experience them in different numbers every time.  You might have a breeze going through it once and be taken down the next time.  The game manages to be incredibly difficult either way.  As a result, replaying the game is always welcome just because the experience is never the same and the same strategy rarely (if ever) works twice.Graphically, Left 4 Dead is incredible.  The character models are outstanding to look at, and so are the environments.  The zombies are also incredibly detailed.  It's also amazing that with all the chaos that can happen on screen at one time the framerate never slows down.  I've also experienced no problems taking it online.Better than the graphics may be the sound.  The sound effects from the zombies are bone chilling.  The music is also good, for the most part.  But the highlight of the sound comes from the characters themselves and how they interact with one another when you perform certain actions.  Shoot a teammate and he'll chastise you.  They call out when you find ammo, weapons and they scream whenever they've been overrun with zombies.  It all sounds fantastic.If there was any problem with Left 4 Dead it would be that it's a drag to play by yourself.  The multiplayer experience is what most gamers ought to take home from Left 4 Dead.  Unfortunately you don't get that same sense of adrenaline from the single player experience.  It just isn't all that fun.In the end Left 4 Dead is an amazing game and an amazing experience.  There are few games that are as good as this or as amazingly fun and adrenaline pumping.  Even those who don't normally like first person shooters can come to Left 4 Dead and enjoy it.  So jump on in and try to survive.  Don't leave this game behind.",5,Don't Leave This Behind,2008/11/20 0:00

I've heard so much about the game and, considering it has David Jaffe's involvement in its' history, you'd think I'd have already played it. Alas, I haven't. Yet, I see the commercial on tv for this game and hear rantin' & ravin' from my friends about the game, I decide to get the PSP installment. Man (or Woman, whatever the case may be..;)), I was missing out on this for this long?? This game blew me away. It's exciting, addictive and challenging. God of War: Chains of Olympus is simply put 'the best looking title' on the system, bar none, yet. I've never seen graphics look quite this good on the system. Honestly. If graphics can get any better than this on the PSP, I'll be amazed. The environments were simply breathtaking, nothing like I've seen before. Course, Ready At Dawn made Daxter visually appealing for its' time.For an action game, this game truly delivers. Especially where the story is concerned. Makes me wish some developers would make portable versions of some of my favorite games(like Shadowman, Bloodrayne, Legacy of Kain or Devil May Cry).There's plenty of bonus content in the game that makes playing through a few times more appealing but I have a problem with the game's length. It is just too short for this kind of game. I managed to get through it in a little over 8 hours. It is, however, a portable game so I have to take that into account. Memory restrictions and whatnot, withstanding, it should be understood.God of War: Chains of Olympus is a remarkable achievement on the PSP. It's a 'must-have' purchase for all owners of a PSP.

Ditto with its sequel which wasn't more awful or greater than the original but it was just....there. After recently purchasing a PSP, I figured why not tackle one of the handheld's heavy hitters. Well the same problems that plagued the others are still here and while many will outright love the game, I've noticed a lot to nitpick.Story: Taking place before the original, Kratos is helping Attica against the siege of the Persian army when a strange light is seen in the sky, covering the land in nighttime. Seems the god Helios is missing and the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus, has taken over and put the gods to sleep. So Kratos must once again save all of Greece.Graphics: The bigger brothers on the PS2 had some pretty fantastic visuals and that gets replicated on Sony's tiny handheld. While they're not up to the visual clarity as those, the sheer size and scale fits perfectly with the series and indeed, many of this looks like it's PS2-ready graphics. During in-game you get occasional pauses for disc loading but other than that, there's nary any fault with this.Sound/Music: Despite only playing 3 games so far (Tactics, Liberty City Stories and this), God of War was the first time that I tried headphones and the experience became more richer. The soundtrack, filled with big choir and orchestras, came to life and very much brought the game to the more cinematic feel it's doing and the voice acting was spot-on.Gameplay: A lot of what God of War did in its gameplay was combine platforming, action and puzzle solving fairly smoothly but what it did with it was my issue. For starters, the controls are intuitive and it's easy to grasp the various combos and such but rolling (L+R and the direction) feels sluggish and with combos to the L and special moves to the R, it can get annoying when you hit the wrong button. Then there's the timed-button presses like when you take down a baddie with either pressing the face buttons or rotating the analog a certain way. The analog ones were aggravating since the time alloted is kind of fast and using the nub felt strange and never felt comfortable enough to bring them down and occasionally got nailed.One big aspect of the game is puzzle solving and while I do like games like Ico or Legend of Zelda where you'd go oohhhhh ok, yeah now I get it"", when you find the solution here, sometimes its more accidental or you consult an FAQ and think ""oh yeah, obviously I would've thought to do THAT"". While it's nothing bad, sometimes solutions just feel too vague and aside from the occasional puzzle, I never solved a puzzle by figuring out but by just stumbling across the answer. Combat though is of course fun and while your favorite combos tend to get repeated a lot, it's still fun to stab and slash at all the baddies though the bigger ones took longer to bring down. As for its length, yes it its short but considering it's a prequel, the PSP's more ""on-the-go"" style and the amount of graphics and stuff, I'm surprised they even crammed this much.Some might disagree with me and plenty of reviews have said this is absolutely one of the best games on the PSP but while I certainly don't think it's the worst, some of my more personal nitpicks and criticisms bring it down a tad but if you want a solid adventure, you could rent this of course.

Fans of the series will also be more than happy to know that God of War: Chains of Olympus stands as the best action title to hit Sony's portable system yet, as it nearly flawlessly brings everything that has made the God of War series so good, and packs it into one small disc.  Taking place before the events of the original God of War, Chains of Olympus finds Kratos as general serving the gods, and also finds him struggling with obeying his orders, or doing what he feels he should.  Undoubtedly the best looking game to hit the PSP yet, God of War: Chains of Olympus retains the excellent production values, addictive combat, tight controls, solid puzzle elements, and unlockable extras that will keep you glued to the game.  The only real downside to Chains of Olympus is that as a whole, the game is too short.  This one flaw is acceptable though, as Chains of Olympus boasts a brilliant score, more fantastic voice acting, and some dynamic action sequences that are easily the best to be seen on the PSP yet.  All in all, God of War: Chains of Olympus is a more than welcome debut of Kratos on the PSP, and is by far the best action game to hit the PSP yet.

Thanks to the handy people over at Ready at Dawn (Daxter) they faithfully translated Kratos into a pint sized angry little man. Instead of talking about what you already know about God of War (everyone should have played at least one...you all own a PS2) let's talk about what's new. First thing you'll notice are the PS2 quality graphics (I mean that to the letter) and all the production values from the PS2 games. We have a new story, which is between 1 and 2, where Kratos is once again seeking the forgiveness of his past but the Gods still deny him.You have some new weapons such as the Gauntlet of Zeus which lets you punch the crap out of everyone, a new Sun Shield which blocks attacks pretty well, along with some new magic like Efreet (fire FTW!), the Mask of Charon (stuns enemies), and the Light of Dawn (a projectile) along with some new moves. You can upgrade everything just like in previous games as well. While everything for CoO is hand tailored (done from scratch nothing from the consoles is in here) you can't tell the difference. While you also get some more nude women (Eos is HOT!), tons more gore, and some new enemies and button time sequences you'll never get bored with the game (for the whole 5 hours it takes to beat) there are plenty of unlockables and you'll more than likely play through this more than once (I'm already on my second go through on God Mode).Every action-adventure fan MUST BUY THIS!

I have to say I've been incredibly impressed with Chains of Olympus for the PSP:  the game looks and plays 99% identical to its big-screen counterparts.(For kicks, you *can* grab an A/V cable and play it on your TV...but I digress)Just as with other titles in the series, Chains of Olympus provides you with an ongoing storyline, heaps of slaughter, and many different combinations to produce the right effect in battle.  It also gives you the ability to choose which skill areas to level"" as you collect orbs, and how far you want to raise them.  Last, we have the in-game plot sequences and the unusual puzzles (reader beware:  your sexual skills will be put to the test shortly into the first chapter).There are differences, but thus far I see only minor ones:  for example, camera rotation can be a bit difficult, and dodge-rolls require tapping both shoulder buttons.  These are still somewhat easily worked around: with a little time and practice, a player can adapt pretty easily.Overall, if you're a fan of the God of War games and want the same experience on the go, you won't be disappointed.

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000ZK9QCS,"Cloud ...""""",34,28,"God of War 3 opens with a massive bang; starting right off from God of War 2, we find Kratos scaling Mount Olympus going after Zeus with the 4 Titans climbing up the mountain ready to cause havoc. From there it's basically a whirlwind of a nearly 40 minute setpiece involving characters on a massive scale, an epic boss fight and some light platforming to break up the action. In a way, this sequence sets up for what you're going to be playing for this roughly 10 hour game (the save point before the long final boss/ending sequence has me at 9 hours 31 minutes) which is graphically gorgeous, refined gameplay from previously and an impressive sense of scale. From there, game doesn't quite match the heights but it's still an incredibly solid adventure but in a way that's kind of the problem with a massive opening sequence; the rest of the game just doesn't have it again but does perform really adequately with what it does show. So 3 years in the making, new director, new system...how does the 3rd installment hold up? Pretty damn well, have to say.Story: As I said before, the game starts you off with Kratos going after Zeus but naturally like God of War 2 or Metroid games, certain things happen that force you to essentially restart from scratch and we go into a tale of Kratos wanting to enact vengeance and near literally kills everyone who stands in his way. From there we will meet familiar gods, battle massive titans and go in and around Mount Olympus as we make our way back to Zeus. Best thing about the story is the pacing which like Uncharted 2, seems to do a really great job at making you feel like you're actually progressing in the game instead of hitting these weird slow areas (remember finding those stupid Sirens in the sandstorm in the first one?) but the opening sequence with Poseidon opens with a bang and it settles into a nice groove and while there isn't anything as jaw-dropping of a scene afterwards, game never lets up and you might find yourself playing longer than you thought you were.Graphics: I'll get one negative out of the way as far as graphically: this game didn't constantly stun me like Uncharted 2 which front to back looks phenomenal. In this game, you'll find parts that'll want to make you go holy ****"" but then other parts look pretty with nice detail until something pops up that makes you say wow again. There, can I talk about how awesome this game looks? And you'll see it right there in the main menu screen which now has the almost iconic Kratos staring at you only this time the detail on his model is really impressive. And there's my favorite thing which is the lighting, especially in low-light situations and having your weapons briefly illuminate the room looks amazing. One cutscene did stutter and lip sync on one line was off though it might've been because a trophy was unlocked at that point but it's easy to see why this game was highly anticipated on the graphics front.Sound/Music: Naturally the word ""epic"" will be tossed around here and for good measure in that while I won't exactly be humming these tunes anytime, the grandiose music perfectly sets the tone with its big choir parts, percussion and intense orchestra. Old familiar sounds are back, weapons and that loud bang you get when doing a big strong attack's still there though the Helios head still makes that bizarre scream everytime you take it out which can potentially get grating. With regards to voice acting, some familiar faces pop up making you go ""wait...did they hire...?"" so we have Rip Torn providing voice for Hephaestus, Hercules' Kevin Sorbo as who else but Hercules and Malcolm McDowell as Daedalus, father to Icarus. Would've been nice to see who did other voices as well such as Zeus, Hera, Gaia or something since only a select few are chosen in the special features.Gameplay: One thing I never liked about previous God of War games is that there's always these weird parts in the game that get put in to not necessarily ruin it but kind of make you wish other things were put in instead. None of the puzzles are that taxing to the brain which is good since I always felt God of War puzzles were too vague in their how-to-solve solutions. Combat feels more tactician based here where it doesn't require a real sense of precision but just mashing square and the occasional triangle will only get you so far and in fact certain enemies are way more vulnerable to certain weapons than others. That being said I still find the controls to not be as super responsive as I saw in Bayonetta. If I wanted her to jump, she jumped; dodge, she dodged but here you'll be tapping that right analog stick to get out of the way and for some reason, Kratos just doesn't move while other times he dodges out of the way. But the powerups and skills are actually useful and the battles, except for one duel involving a new unbelievably annoying enemy type and a dog that spits out other dogs grated on my nerves. The game also has some backtracking which is odd because I remember in previous God of Wars I did that very little and if I did it's because I went somewhere to give me something that'll turn on something but in this game you'll literally re-see areas more than once because that's what the story needs. Minor gripe but in God of War 1, I always felt like I was moving forward and seeing what else the game had in store for me; here it feels like a slight hub world.One improvement over previous games is how the QTE events work. Whereas before a big Triangle or Circle would show up in the center of the screen, the prompts now show up on their respective corners in relation to where they are on the controller (Circle is Right, Triangle's up etc) so thanks to your eye's weird peripheral vision, you can actually tell which side of the screen a prompt showed up in which keeps your eyes focused on the fantastically gory kills Kratos can do. Also the ""mash Circle"" prompts feel a lot more forgiving now and as an example, take the Minotaur. Remember how in God of War 1, you climbed on his chest and tried to run a blade down his mouth? Well I remember my hand hurting because regardless of how fast I was pressing, it still felt like Kratos took way too long to jab that knife in there but now it feels quicker and doesn't require insane amounts of speed to get done. My one issue is in regards to the R1 prompts in the levels themselves in that they either took me a bit of time to actually access them (I'll end up running around a save point until the prompt came up sometimes) or in one case, I had to open a door to rescue someone from being smooshed yet for some reason the game didn't actually let me grab that thing despite my pressing R1. Some might not notice it but that's what I saw anyway.Upon completing the game, you'll be rewarded with the super hard Titan mode, Challenge of the Gods where you got to perform certain tasks in an arena like killing everyone with no weapons used or making sure enemies don't respawn past a certain limit. They're kind of fun but there's only 7 or so and they can be potentially frustrating. There's also a combat arena which I assume is meant as a kind of testing area to hone your fighting skills though it would've been cool if it acted as a quasi-Horde mode where you had to see how long you can survive. Also unlocked are the traditional God of War making-of videos which I think seriously needs to become a staple in games since we never really get to see the talent or even hardships a team can face so for example in these videos, we see the sudden departure of Cory Balrog, director of God of War 2 and the ""promotion"" of new director Stig Asmussen, their jitters about unveiling an E3 demo which still needs to be reworked 2 weeks before the event and all in all, they're great looks into a game company known for talent but we don't quite see enough of it in other developers and if we do, it's usually those talking head interviews about all the cool stuff we're doing. Plus they're usually in Collector's Editions.Is God of War 3 the absolute best game of 2010? It's certainly one of the top ones but considering the almost wallet-busting array of games coming out this year, there's no doubt many will remember this game but whether it wins, it can be likely but keep in mind Mass Effect 2 came out this year, Mario Galaxy 2 and Metroid and possibly Zelda are out, Halo Reach might even be more than just a shinier Halo 3 and if the Last Guardian comes out this year than that's my automatic GOTY but whereas God of War 3 is pretty short, it's a pretty balls-to-the-wall experience that everyone needs to play at least once.""",5,Easily a GOTY contender,2010/3/17 0:00
A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000R3BNHE,"Cloud ...""""",3,2,"The original Nights for the Sega Saturn, like Panzer Dragoon Saga, was one of those cult classic games that many people still refer to when they talk about their favorite games but for the most part, most of us have only heard of it rather than actually played the thing. With massive demand and finally an announcement, players got excited that there was going to be as sequel, titled Journey of Dreams. But given Sonic Team's strange track record lately as well as the huge hype, could this really live up to the hype? Well it doesn't completely deliver so much as it delivers and then drops the ball then delivers again.Story: Will, an aspiring soccer player, and Helen, a practicing violinist, are pulled into Nightopia, the land that's created when people dream. But the evil of beings called Nightmaren want to rid the world of Nightopia so it's up to Will, Helen and our favorite flying jester, Nights, to gather up Ideya, the components that make up Nightopia, and rid the dream world of Nightmaren.Graphics: Recently I bought a component cable for the Wii which allows 480p resolution and Nights was one of the first to be tested and even without it, the game would still be amazing visually. With a bright color palette and lush looking levels, the game is a great example at how you don't need realistic skin tones to create great graphics and with 480p going, the game is even beautiful still. The cutscene graphics are okay but the opening cinema and the levels though are just vibrant and colorful.Sound/Music: Normally in these kind of games, I just put on my own music but the music in Nights is very lively and filled with memorable, upbeat tones and is the kind of soundtrack that you'd very well consider buying. The voice acting, however, is not horrendous a la Sonic's 3D adventures but they're still unfortunate since the British accents are quite off and the readings are kind of stilted and awkward.Gameplay: I had read several reviews where people found the Wii controls awkward so I thought I'd start right off the bat with a good-ol' Gamecube controller and controlling Nights wasn't even that much of a problem. While initially awkward to get the feeling for how it works, it soon became a breeze but when I thought I'd check out the Wii ones, I found them awkward as well and went back to the trusty Gamecube controller. The game also lets you use the Classic controller, Wii-mote by itself or standard Wii controls. Nights acts as a kind of rail shooter/Sonic the Hedgehog combo where Nights flies in the air and you control her direction from diving, climbing, doing loops (called Paraloops which act as a vortex sucking in important items within its radius) or dashing to gain speed and crash into stuff.The big minus is the platform-style parts where you physically control Will or Helen (they dualize"" with Nights for the flying stuff) and with the normal controllers they're fine, the Wii controls just don't feel right, not to mention the very notion of having platforming in the game when it was doing just fine with being a rail shooter hurts it. The other negative is the checkpoint system or rather its lack of one as when you progress through the story levels, you get a cutscene, play a level than the stage boss but should you fail against the boss, you have to start the level over complete with cutscenes and the level you just killed. It's quite a buzzkill when you're playing and unless you're a pro that could get through the game without failing once, it's quite a downer when you have to replay what you just beat with no checkpoint in place.Some are quite disappointed while others think its flawed but a good game overall. I'm in the second camp since I felt compelled to play again when I turned off the system but you kind of hope certain things are corrected for the hopefully-done 3rd game.""",4,3.5; as beautiful as it is flawed,2008/1/16 0:00

The main character, NiGHTS, is an acrobatic being who flies around a dreamscape battling creatures of nightmares.The main character is NiGHTS, a mischievous jester who works against a being that seeks to take the spirits of people who dream. The two other protagonists are a young boy and a young girl, who for their own reasons have been having nightmares recently and come to the dream world to escape their problems. However, only through defeating the evil being can they save the paradise of their dream-world.The game looks 3d, but is actually 2d. The levels are in most cases racetrack-shaped, looping around so that it's more than just a straight line. NiGHTS flies around, leaving a trail of pixie dust as it goes. If the pixie dust is formed into a loop, a small portal is generated that destroys enemies. NiGHTS' main other technique is a drilling boost that smashes into enemies in addition to making NiGHTS go faster. The goal of missions differs from area to area; some involve chasing enemies to find keys, while others simply involve flying through a set number of rings. After completing some missions, boss fights with special conditions will take place - though they're more of ""puzzles"" or ""challenges"" than traditional boss fights.There are also platforming sections where you play as the ""dreamers"" - whichever child is currently ""dreaming"" at that point in the game. When playing as a dreamer, there is a time limit before you are pursued by creatures that try to ""wake you up"" (a ""Night Over"" is basically a ""Game Over"", so waking up essentially equals losing). There are some things you can do to avoid waking up  - finding treasure chests prolongs your time, and you can distract your pursuers by throwing blue chips, which are small collectible items found on the stages.The game is more complicated than it really ought to be, but that's really only in theory - in the game itself the concepts are reasonably accessible. The only problem with gameplay is that, due to the 3d field hiding what's really a 2d track it can be hard to keep track of what's in the foreground and what's in the background. This remained my most constant issue throughout the game - since most of the objects consists of brightly colored, but relatively featureless, shapes, it was difficult to tell things apart, and as such it was easy to become disoriented.The graphics are good - about standard for a Wii game, which means a little bit behind what's considered ""Next Gen"" but still pretty good. The camera (as referenced above) is the biggest problem, often undoing the simple fun of flying around by pointing at an angle that makes it hard to see where exactly you're supposed to be going. Sometimes it switches from a straight-on camera to a third-person following camera, which complicates things even further.As a whole, NiGHTS can be kind of fun, once you figure out how everything works. Besides the main game, there's also multiplayer (local or online) and ""My Dream"", a small garden where the enemies defeated and good creatures saved by NiGHTS are sent and can be interacted with. Both of these add at least some extra play value to the game. It's difficult to say what's wrong with NiGHTS, because there's not much particularly wrong; it's just not fun to play for the most part. It doesn't handle that well, and the camera makes it worse. As a total package, it can be pretty good, but it's kind of difficult - annoyingly so - to pick up.7/10.""",4,Learning Curve but Kind of Fun,2008/10/21 0:00

Hard to believe, but yes, and what's even harder to believe is that it took Sega all that time before coming out with a follow up to their cult smash.  Anyway, Nights: Journey of Dreams is here for the Wii, and the game is a very fun follow up to the original masterpiece, and despite it's flaws, is a blast to play.  If you've played the original Nights, you'll feel right at home here with the flight-based gameplay, wonderful soundtrack, and brilliantly realized level designs that populate the Nights universe.  The game's artistic style is by far it's greatest strength, giving Nights an undeniable charm that is hard to top.  Where Nights disappoints is with some of the Wii-mote controls, which come off as too cumbersome, but this can be fixed thanks to the fact the game supports the Classic and Gamecube controlers.  Where the game also falls is with some of the on-foot platforming elements, which just aren't much fun at all.  Not to mention that just like the original game, Nights: Journey of Dreams is too short.  It won't take you long to get through the game, and once you do, as before, you'll be begging for more.  Despite it's flaws though, Nights: Journey of Dreams is one of the better third-party Wii titles to see the light of day this holiday season.  The charm of the presentation makes it worthwhile for children, and the addictive gameplay makes it worth playing for older gamers with fond memories of the original.  For those longtime fans of the original Nights, you'll be pleased to see many references and homages to the original game peppered throughout Nights: Journey of Dreams, but the game doesn't do this enough to put off new gamers either.

While NiGHTS feels a lot like the Saturn game and the Sonic games they did a semi-decent job with this. While the graphics are sometimes pretty, and while gliding around and making Paraloops to capture Nightopians from giant black holes of doom is fun it gets kind of old after a while. You can play as either Will or Helen who are two children who land in the world if Nightopia while sleeping. They of course meet NiGHTS (who is a sexually confused Nightmaren) to save the world from Reala and Master Wizeman.Some levels consist of you looping and swooping through an on rails level of collecting rings, busting open cages with nothing in them, and ummm...fighting weird bosses. While the bosses are weird they are the best part of the game such as a giant clown that you have to bounce vertically through a series of obstacles pinball style.

A2IGEPJJYKMOWK,B000R3BNHE,UziHorowitz,2,1,"NiGHTS Into Dreams is a beloved SEGA Saturn classic, and for good reason, as it happens to be an absolute classic. Fans have waited years for a sequel to the game, but NiGHTS Journey of Dreams came out and received a pretty mixed response from ardent NiGHTS fans. Some thought it was good, others thought it was a big diappointment. Me? Personally, I'm mostly part of the former group. Let me explain why.NiGHTS Journey of Dreams retains the fantastic music, enviroments, and for the most part, gameplay, of NiGHTS Into Dreams. To get the best experience, either opt for the Classic Controller or Wiimote+Nunchuk combo, but just don't use the motion controls, as they're frustrating at best. As NiGHTS, you'll fly through beautiful environments, going through rings, collecting items, etc. The core structure is pretty much identical to that of NiGHTS Into Dreams. It works well and it's fun. Some people have criticized the gameplay segments where you play as either of the two kids, but I didn't find it that bad. It's certainly not as exhilarating as the flying gameplay, but it's not bad at all. NiGHTS Into Dreams also had you controlling either of the two kids at times. Like NiGHTS Into Dreams, the boss fights are excellent in this game and quite imaginative.The graphics are mostly beautiful. While environments amaze with their attention to detail, the cinematic cutscenes leave quite a bit to be desired and are of low quality. The voice acting is this game's biggest downfall, as it's poorly done and sounds pretty childish.So I've listed the pros and cons to NiGHTS Journey of Dreams, but the best thing about this game is the music, as it happens to mostly live up to the incredible music in NiGHTS Into Dreams. Just beautiful all around.Honestly, I don't get the complaining with this game. Is it as good as NiGHTS Into Dreams? Nope, definitely not. However, it still pays pretty good homage to that game and delivers on the core NiGHTS experience. It definitely has some nuisances, like the poor voice acting, but it's forgivable due to the nice gameplay, environments, music, etc.",4,Not Bad At All,2011/9/17 0:00

A2LPJD19MGBNXJ,B002AB7TX8,"Adrian Jenkins southerndudeman""""",5,4,"I can't believe that what is assuredly a fringe game like Demon's Souls"" is garnering the reviews it has garnered. The number of people who claim that this is the best game they've ever played lead me to wonder...what other games they've played.Still, there is a very undeniable charm in this one that is hard to put your finger on, but there nonetheless. It makes for a tough job to even review the game, let alone play it. I've been a fan of FROM Software's ""King's Field"" Series from the ground floor, and this game shares much with that series, but it certainly isn't like that. It's CERTAINLY not like the RPGs you are accustomed to (either American or Japanese), but there's still some nuances from those games that appear as well (and I'm not talking simply about the levelling/grinding aspects). But anyway, here goes:The Good:1) Atmosphere - Another reviewer used the word ""personality"" to describe this, and it's almost perfect as a metaphor. This game has personality. The worlds have a unique character. The enemies run the gamut from cute to cool to horrifying (however, they are all mostly difficult). You are constantly on your toes, never knowing if around that next corner lurks an enemy that is 1000x stronger than any you've faced previously (if you think I am being hyperbolic, you are wrong). I can't count the number of times I've actually gone to the end of my chair in anticipation and fear.2) Combat - while there are problems, overall the combat engine is solid. Different weapons play VERY differently. There is a vast difference between using a spear, a straight sword, a curved sword, or a mace (to name but a few). Spells have advantages and disadvantages. Overall, balance is good here. If you lose a battle (and you will lose many), for the most part, the fault is yours, not the games. There are exceptions, but combat feels...right, for the most part.3) Bosses - I can't stress enough - you feel a sense of accomplishment when you beat one of the game's many bosses. When you stare down the giant Tower Knight, or come face-to-face with the Flame Lurker (who are merely major demons, by the way, and not the monstrous arch-demons you'll fight later), you realize that this isn't a battle you're going to win by simply slashing away. You're going to have to think, and when you beat them, you'll heave that sigh of relief (if not bellow a cheer of victory).The Bad:1) Camera - I wanted to like the camera, but the biggest problem is this: the lock-on function is controlled by the same stick as the camera. Thus, if you try to lock on to a single enemy during a multi-enemy battle, the camera becomes mostly inoperable, as you will simply change the enemy on which you are locked. It would have been much better to make lock-on the LS button (which is instead used for the completely-useless shield push), and have the right stick devoted to the camera. There are other issues as well, but this is the biggest.2) Cheap tactics - OK, I said above that combat was mostly fair. This only serves to make the instances in which it is not vastly more frustrating. An attack which wasn't hurting you before will suddenly pummel you for no good reason (e.g. the ""lightning bolts"" of the storm beasts will...start hurting you through walls, for no good reason). Moreover, the dark demeanor of the game is great for mood, but really bad when you have to cross small bridges in the wall. The unfair platformer elements (which there are precious few) are just stinky. ""Oh, that bridge that looked solid gave way under my feet for no reason, and now I'm dead!"" This game is difficult enough as it is - there is no reason to cheapify things further.3) Story - What a miss. This might be the biggest problem with the game. It is clear that there is a good story lurking here. I can understand that, in a solo venture, it's not reasonable to have tons of characters with whom to talk and flesh out the story. So, why not use a codex, a la ""Dragon Age""? There are literally HUNDREDS of dead bodies in the game. Would it have been so hard to put...journals on some of them? Stolen documents? ""King's Field"" for the PS2 did a great job of this. It is a damn shame that it is missing here.So, in short: this isn't the perfect game, and more than likely, this isn't going to be the best game you've ever played. At many times, it's a frustrating exercise in level grinding and equipment building. I did in fact throw my controller once. But I can't deny that this game constantly brings me back. It is one of the first games that I feel like I have accomplished something when I succeed.I have not commented on the multi-player aspects, because I am a solo player. I hear it is excellent, however, but you'll have to read about it elsewhere. Happy gaming!""",4,"A good game, but clearly overrated here",2009/12/10 0:00

That's right, Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction, that's what game.  I won't lie to you, I was expecting ALOT of the first PS3 iteration of R&C.;So, what do I think of Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction? Well- if you look at how much fun I thought the game was & how I rate the game overall, you'd have a pretty good idea. First and foremost, I was impressed by virtually everything about the game. Even though it's alot more of the familiar territory that the Playstation 2 games were, Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destructiondoes it on a much grander scale. It, definitely, has a much more epic feel to it. In what other game could you grindrail with a building coming down around you, anyways? Another thing, the newer gameplay mechanics introduced into the game felt natural yet innovative at the same time(like, for example, tilting your Sixxaxis Controller to control Ratchet through a bunch of flying cars after he jumps from a building). Graphically, this game is simply amazing. It's vibrant and colorful and is like you're playing a Pixar movie. Sound is top-notch. Gameplay is pretty much what you'd expect for a R&C; game but it's riveting and, above all, fun.The only fault I found with the game is, if you're a seasoned R&C; vet, you're going to blow through the game rather quickly...and that's even with rounding up every last thing in the game and doing everything you need to do. I clocked in, roughly, 10 to 12 hours on the game.

While most of it is cross-platform with the Xbox 360, there is always that one game that I haven't tried that I would love to play. Naturally one of the big PS3 titles is the latest in the Ratchet and Clank series, a platformer series that I will admit I never bothered trying in the past. While I'm still not that big into platformers, I have to admit I quite enjoyed Tools of Destruction and makes for a great playthrough.Story: The story finds the duo being hunted by Emperor Tachyon and everywhere they go, there seems to always be someone who are trying to take the two down. So they both go across the galaxy to figure out not only why Tachyon wants them dead so badly but other reasons which may have to do with Ratchet's race, the Lombaxes. As well, Clank seems to have a strange connection with an alien trible known as the Zoni.Graphics: Tools of Destruction is one of those kind of games that if people were to watch you play, they'd most likely crowd around the TV and watch because the graphics here are stellar. From the bright and vivid (not to mention sharp) color palette to the worlds you traverse, it's an incredibly great looking title and there's barely any hint of slowdown or drop in framerate either.Sound/Music: Anyone hooked up to a sound system will have plenty to like here since the sound is grand and orchestral and really comes to life and makes the worlds seem that much immersive. While it's not a catchy score per se, it more than does the job. Ditto with the voice acting which is also well done and doesn't suffer from that ironic tone voice actors sometimes use where they have to ham it up on a line. Even the Zoni have awesome voices and make one remember the aliens from the Toy Story"" movies.Gameplay: To be honest, I'm not that into platformers. Whereas ones like the Prince of Persia series are favorites, it's that sort-of run-and-gun feel that I never bought into. But what makes R&C; fun is just how easy it is to get into and upon fiddling a bit with sensitivity and camera options, it was a breeze to get into. The weapons are customizable for better damage, more ammo and the like and the variety found makes killing enemies dare I say it, fun. From a device that shoots bees to a tornado launcher or missile lock and even items that make the enemies start dancing, it's fun just to switch weapons on the go and use whatever you want on them.The puzzles aren't really all that difficult and it's really just a case of using your brains to solve them and not having to pause just to try and figure it out. On occasion you'll have some moments that fully use the Sixaxis controller like when you freefall and dodge traffic or missiles to flying through the air or lasering out walls. Unfortunately, I could never really get the hang of it and while they weren't as awful as say, Lair, I still just switched to the trusty analog stick. Another gripe is the checkpoint system; dying is not frustrating in a Ninja Gaiden way but when you get sent back it was kind of surprising just how far back I was sent and you felt like ""oh come on, they're sending me back THIS far?"" While I'd get to where I needed to be eventually, it was annoying feeling a sense of progression and having to reload back in the field instead of the cave/dungeon I just recently entered.With extras like skill points, challenge modes, different fights to take on in an Arena, plus upgrading your weapons to max, there's plenty to do once you're finished. Also it's just so much fun and this one's well worth your time (also if you can get online and order from the PS Store, download the next installment ""Quest for Booty"").""",5,A must-have for the PS3,2008/9/6 0:00

Fans of the series will enjoy more madcap action that previous games have delivered, buffed up with improved graphics and physics courtesy of the PS3.The gameplay handles well, and hasn't changed from previous Ratchet and Clank games in any significant ways. The normal gameplay is third-person action platforming, using a wide variety of weapons. The weapons differ from traditional action games - there's no standard ""machine guns"" or ""shotguns"" or ""rocket launchers""; instead, weapons include things like ""electro-whips"", ""tornado summoner"", and ""plasma-beast dispenser"". Even the basic ""shoot at enemies"" weapon is still somewhat unusual - it's like a machine gun, but it's not as fast, and it shoots fire that bounces when it hits enemies. The weapons are fun to use, and even the standard weapons are still enjoyable after a while.The weapons can be upgraded in two ways - either automatically through use, or more specifically by spending ""Raritanium"" (an element acquired in certain special areas) on upgrades. Upgrades made with Raritanium follow a pattern - like the Sphere Grid in FFX, you must buy some upgrades to unlock upgrades further along. These upgrades range from damage to range to firing speed to the amount of bolts (currency) generated by defeated enemies with that weapon. Each weapon also has a different path of upgrades to follow, as well.Besides weapons, the other category of usable items are ""devices"" - more expensive items usable for only one use per purchase that can't be replenished by finding ammo around the stages. These devices have more spectacular effects than regular weapons, ranging from confusing enemies to leeching health from enemies to stunning enemies in a large radius. They are more ""support items"" than actual weapons, but can help out in a tough situation. There is also a wide range of inventory items like jetpacks and magnetic boots, but these tend to be more passive and automatic, simply augmenting your normal movement commands (instead of having to switch them in and out). Weapons are aimed either by shooting while looking in a direction, or an over-the-shoulder mode for more accurate aiming.Other than the normal gameplay, there are also some different segments as well. In some parts, there's rail-grinding sequences, or sequences where you're falling from a great height and must avoid traffic or missiles by moving the Sixaxis controller around. These segments occur reasonably rarely and are short enough that they're fun without being laborious or repetitive. As a whole, the game is very smooth and intuitive, though some of the maneuvers aren't explained very well, despite the pop-up tutorials - in my own case, I didn't trigger the pop-up tutorial for long jumping until I had figured it out myself and was about to do it, despite having unsuccessfully jumped over the same ledge five or six times while trying to figure it out. However, once you figure it out, the game is fun and enjoyable to play.The graphics are well done, maintaining an over-the-top cartoonish style without being burdened by effects like cel-shading or the overusage of lighting and bloom. Everything is crisp and viewing is easy on the eyes, unlike a lot of PS3 games where due to the lighting and reflections it actually becomes hard to see in many circumstances. The animation is smooth and I didn't experience any slowdown even with a huge number of objects on the screen. The sound is about average - it's all right to listen to, but nothing really stood out in terms of music or voice acting.Overall, the game is fun and enjoyable. Fans of the series will find more of the stuff they liked - platforming and destruction, with no fancy add-ons or series-breaking additions. The only real problem is that it's all the same as every other R+C game, but in this case it works for the better.8/10.""",4,Fun and Enjoyable,2008/10/21 0:00

This was the start of the trilogy followed by Quest For Booty and the finale A Crack in Time all which were interwoven nicely. As expected this game will be just as enjoyable as the previous ones and with the entertaining characters in the game from Ratchet and Clank to bumbling hero wannabe Captain Qwirk.  I do advise though that if you get this game that you do get the other two as again this is a trilogy arc and the storyline is not finished until the third game R&C:A Crack in Time, but I'm sure you'll have no problem with that choice as all three games have great entertainment value...",5,Nice Start To The Trilogy Clank Arc,2013/2/6 0:00
A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B000UC5ML0,"Richard Baker BinaryMessiah""""",1,0,"The Good: Funny dialog, great story, great weapons, intuitive use of SixAxis, tried and true game play is intactThe Bad: Nothing really added, extremely difficult and unbalanced, lame extras, could have looked a lot betterThe dynamic duo that debuted on the PS2 nine years ago is now back in next generation action with new weapons, updated graphics, and the same awesome stories and dialog you would expect from the series. Future sees the duo fighting an ancient race known as the Cragmites that Ratchet's lombax ancestors supposedly destroyed. Ratchet learns more about his ancestors dark past and must stop the evil Emperor Tachyon before he annihilates the last of the lombax race: Ratchet.The game hasn't changed in the past nine years and this is both good and bad. The tried and true action platforming formula that revolutionized the platforming genre is still intact here, but with no upgrades. Ratchet can jump around, hover, glide, fly, roll, and shoot his way through hordes of enemies. The game is also a third person shooter that allows strafing from side to side, and a first person mode. You have to go around worlds finding certain gadgets and weapons to kill bigger badder enemies and unlock areas. Gadgets range from the classic Slingshot and Gravity/Grind Boots to the new Geo Laser (that uses the SixAxis to guide it), the Hover Wings (also uses SixAxis), and more. Weapons include the Combuster, Shard Repeater, Tornado Launcher (that uses SixAxis to guide the tornadoes), Death Springs, Predator Missile, and more. There are some defensive weapons like the awesome Grovatron which shoots out  disco ball and makes the enemies dance. The Morph gun turns enemies into penguins while the Gelenator uses green jello goop that lets you jump to higher areas in certain levels. All the weapons are original, creative, and really fun to use. Some enemies are weaker to other weapons which makes weapons gained in the beginning useless towards the end so there are balancing issues.Weapons can be upgraded automatically from use or you can do it yourself by collecting Raritanium and upgrading at weapon stations. You can also buy new weapons as well as armor, and gadgets like Leech Bombs. Buying items in the game requires nuts and bolts that are collecting from killing enemies or breaking open boxes. There are also some ammo boxes spread throughout the level so keep and eye out for those. There are also life boxes that you can collect, but these tend to be rare thanks to the game's high difficulty. Yeah the game is really hard because not only are the bosses hard, but later on in the game  few hits will kill you even if your health is past the 200 range. I found this very frustrating plus no matter how much you upgrade your weapons you never feel like they're powerful enough which leads to ammo issues. This is a huge downfall on the game, and I hope the new game fixes this problem.If you really love just killing enemies you can go into the infamous gladiator stages and earn yourself some serious bolts by beating waves of enemies with certain instructions. These can range from only using your wrench, weapons switching automatically, to even boss fight tag teams. Some people are probably wondering about Clank. Well he gets his own upgraded and improved levels using the mysterious Zoni as his helpers instead of the little robot Clanks. You can levitate across gaps, order them to repair things, and the newest addition is slowing down time. Clank's sections haven't been updated too much, but it's enough to keep you from getting bored.You can also collect gold bolts and unlock skill points to buy some costumes in the extras menu, but they aren't that great so only hardcore fans should indulge.Another side note that I have to mention is that the game uses the SixAxis really well from diving from the sky, to using the weapons, to even shaking your booty in a pirate dancing mini-game...yeah only in Ratchet & Clank. One of my favorite mini-games is the new tilt-the-ball"" type hacking game which has a spark running from circuits and you have to tilt the controller to guide a metal ball to connect the gaps so the spark can reach its node. The game throws a lot of new stuff at you at  good rate so this keeps you from getting bored. I just wish that the game weren't so hard so it could be more enjoyable. What makes the game even harder is the checkpoints are far and few in between. You can finish half a level then have to start over from the beginning: Not good.If you think Future suffers from a lot of problems it does. The huge difficulty problem, poor balancing, and not so next-gen graphics make you really consider this for a purchase, but with a super funny story, loveable characters, and great weapons it makes up for all those shortcomings. The Groovitron alone is worth the play through.""",4,A great entry into the next generation,2012/3/28 0:00

As is generally the case, I adore most of the new weapons modifications and miss some of the old which weren't included. The storyline is as funny, quirky and witty as ever.

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000UC5ML0,S. Rhodes,0,0,"Ratchet and Clank started things off with a bang on the Playstation 2.  Becoming a huge seller on the Playstation 2 by offering some dynamic platforming, weapons combat and puzzles.  When the Playstation 3 dropped down Insomniac games shifted focus from Ratchet and Clank and first gave us Resistance: Fall of Man.  A year into the PS3's life, however, and Insomniac Game brought back Ratchet and Clank with a whole new story and adventure.  Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction may be the best one in the series.Things are looking normal for our heroes who have saved the galaxy countless times.  Ratchet and Clank are just fixing a vehicle when they get a call from the Planetary Defense Center.  The city of Metropolis is under attack by an army that is being led by the evil Emperor Tachyon.  He's come to Metropolis for only one reason: To find and eradicate Ratchet--the last of the Lombax species.  And he's willing to level entire cities to do it.  Once Ratchet and Clank barely escape their quest takes them across the galaxy looking for the secrets of the past.  Why does Tachyon want to eliminate the Lombaxes?  And what was the Lombax secret?  The story, by all accounts, is much more heavily character focused than the other games which came before it.  In particular, you'll learn a lot more about Ratchet than you have in other games.  It makes for a more personal story and it's an exciting one.  It's filled with familiar characters and a few new ones.  It's also humorous in every way but also much more mature than most people really give it credit for.  There's a lot more heart in this story and makes a much more distinct connection with its characters.That being said, the only real issue with the story is that Tachyon just isn't an interesting character.  This is especially sad considering how present Dr. Nefarious was in Up Your Arsenal.  You'll rarely see what's going on for Tachyon or what he's doing.  He doesn't quite feel as absent as Drek does in the first one, but you rarely get the sense that Tachyon is really doing anything.  In some ways that's perfectly fine as the story going on with Ratchet and Clank is ultimately more satisfying and interesting than any game in the series thus far.  It more than makes up for the lack of focus on Tachyon because it keeps the focus on the main characters and really developing them.  It makes the story by far the most rewarding in the series.Ratchet and Clank has had a familiar formula for years and that doesn't change with Tools of Destruction.  Those familiar with any of the other games in the series will know what to expect.  There's a lot of running, jumping and blowing things up.  You'll find yourself collecting bolts aplenty to buy new weapons and armor.  There's not much here you haven't seen.  The weapons are certainly very fascinating, however.  There are some nice things here such as the new Tornado Launcher or being able to place down a swarm that will kill off the bad guys.  Like Up Your Arsenal each weapon is constantly leveling up.  What's new, however, is that you will not just gain bolts but Raritanium.  While Raritanium is nothing new to Ratchet and Clank, here it's actually used to purchase perks for your weapons such as more ammo, longer range or more power.  Each weapon also has a master perk that adds a new element.  For instance, the Fusion Bomb will have a master upgrade that allows each bomb to explode into a smaller set of bombs that may damage other enemies in the area.  Each weapon goes through five levels and once they hit level five they change into a totally different weapon.There are other editions, however.  You not only have weapons, but also devices that aren't always weapons but rather just things to help distract enemies.  The devices are usually independent of Ratchet.  For instance, you can use the Groovitron to make enemies dance in place, or use a Leech Bomb to drain their health.  You might not always need devices, but they add variety to the game.There is also a lot of space combat where you'll fly on rails and aim at various targets.  Usually these segments end with a boss fight as well.  None of these moments are challenging, however.  Which may be something about the game overall.  The first three Ratchet and Clank games were quite the challenge from time to time but Future: Tools if Destruction is a relatively simple game by comparison.  Your nanotech increases a lot easier than it did in the previous games.  But the most strange thing is that you'll rarely (if ever) find yourself short on bolts.  In previous games, grinding for bolts was a must, but in Future: Tools of Destruction you'll find you almost always have the right number of bolts.  And if you don't, it's never detrimental to buy a new weapon as your old ones will level up quite quickly and never be useless.  Your default weapons will still be enough to hold you over at the end.  But even then, you'll end up getting enough bolts almost purely by accident.  Bolts are everywhere, in large quantities and never stop coming.  You'll also find jackpot crates that double bolts.  Even if you manage to be having some trouble in Future: Tools of Destruction your nanotech will increase enough times that you'll eventually be able to dominate your foes purely based off the fact that you have too much health to be taken down.That's not to say it doesn't have its challenging moments.  It's only to say that eventually you'll succeed because the game has fewer limitations than previous games.  Your health is always restored when you go to a weapon shop, for instance, and sometimes there's one sitting right next to you in major battles.At the very least Future: Tools of Destruction does have some well designed areas, although it's a lot more linear than the other games.  For instance, in previous games you had various paths you could take the moment you touched down, but Future: Tools of Destruction is much more about making sure you progress through the games story.  Meaning that instead of being able to start off by going down three different paths only to find easy shortcuts back to your ship, you often only have one path to take to your next goal, which is never a mystery to you.  That's okay by me, as many of the game's locales are absolutely huge and populated with plenty of things to do such as puzzles, enemies aplenty and gold bolts to collect off the beaten path.  The feeling of exploration is still there, it's just that the various missions"" can't be done in nearly any order like previous games.Production wise, Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction may be the best the PS3 has to offer.  Despite originally releasing in 2007, the game still looks a lot better than you'd expect it to.  The cartoon like quality really helps a lot of the characters pop with detail.  It also helps that so much of the environments are colorful.  There's a lot of life in Ratchet and Clank and that really helps the game seem much bigger and more epic than it actually is.  In particular, the game's opening moments in Metropolis are some of the most amazing you'll see in the series.  But perhaps the most amazing thing is how well animated everything is in the game's various pre-rendered cutscenes or even in game.  There's a lot of detail and a lot of chaos that can go on.  And it rarely slows down when things happen such as enemies populating the screen or bolts flying around everywhere.The only real hiccup is that while the in game engine never buckles, the pre-rendered cutscenes sometimes do.  Sometimes the audio gets a little wonky and the actual speech doesn't match up with the lip movements.  This is actually rather sad as the voice acting and writing you see here is some of the best in the series.  So when a pre-rendered scene starts to buckle it's a little sad.  The animations and voice acting aren't just some of the best in the series, but some of the best I've ever seen of any game.Musically, Future: Tools of Destruction may have the best music in the series.  It's not quite as ""mechanical"" as some of the other tunes, but there are moments that much more emotionally investing and moments where the music really compliments the environments a lot.  It's a pretty amazing soundtrack overall, topped off by some fantastic sound effects.  Everything about the production values comes forth to make a really solid package.  One of the best uses of technology on the system you're likely to see.  If anything, the game is always running A LOT of things, making me wish that it could be installed instead of everything always constantly being read from the disk.  It's quite clear Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction is running A LOT of stuff and you'll hear it reading from the disc constantly.Overall, Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction is one of the best in the series.  It's got such an engrossing story and gameplay that's it's hard not to like it.  It's an ambitious game technologically that really showcases--even now--just what video games can be with the right art design and graphical prowess in place.  If you're a fan of Ratchet and Clank then Future: Tools of Destruction should not be missed.""",5,When the Galaxy Needs a Hero,2012/11/6 0:00

It looks phenomenal and is a real joy to play. You play as Nate Drake in search of Sir Francis Drake's lost treasure. I've always had a soft spot for games that reference historical figures like this and Uncharted comes through in spades. The gameplay is very natural and intuitive and the voice acting is great as well. I never had any difficulty getting the hang of the controls at all. The hand to hand combat is also very cool and enough to make you want to toss your weapons at times just to validate your Man Card. The story keeps your attention and the cutscenes are not too long or too short. And I think the killer aspect of the game that just brings it all home is the fantastic score. This is what developers need to look for when getting the music for a new game. This is even better than my other favorite modern game score Halo 3. This is also one of the first games to come out with trophies after Sony announced them for PS3 and I will always give props to developer Naughty Dog for giving the people what they want. This is a fantastic game and should be owned by any ps3 owner and doubly so if you like good action adventure games.Pros: Jaw Dropping graphics. Jaw Dropping Movie Quality score. Excellent story.

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000UW21A0,"Cloud ...""""",3,3,"Anyone who's ever played games in recent years have noticed an increase in cutscenes and FMV's to tell the story. While there's nothing inherently wrong with it, some might find the gameplay a bit unbalanced and you spend your time watching rather than playing (Metal Gear Solid games for one). But with the advantage of being able to make the story as long as you want in whatever genre one chooses, games in capable hands can rival the best of Hollywood's films and even provide a thrilling narrative you'd get from a good book. While Uncharted admittedly has its problems, it's still one of the premier titles to get for the Playstation 3.Story: You play as Nathan Drake, a descendant of the famous explorer Sir Francis Drake. Drake uncovers a clue that could lead them to the treasure of a lifetime but things of such nature can bring people willing to get it for personal profit and along with Elena Fisher, a TV documentarian and Sullivan, Drake's friend and colleague, Drake has to trek through the jungles and uncover the secret buried within its forests and catacombs.Graphics: Uncharted was one of the first games I played on an HDTV running in 720p and I got to say, this is one of the most gorgeous games on the console. From the realistic character animation (though Elena's eyes look freaky) to the colorful and vast jungle surroundings to the unbelievable water effects, this game is definately a showcase for your brand new HDTV.Sound/Music: Equally impressive is the musical store which gives it that bombast and anthemic scores expectant of films like Raiders of the Lost Ark. While some of the in-game music is used sparingly for more ambiance, it's quite welcome when it's there. Along with the score is some fantastic voice acting with everyone providing non-cheesy voiceovers and it becomes a game great to see as well as hear.Gameplay: Anyone who's ever played Tomb Raider or Prince of Persia will find things similar here. While Drake uses guns instead of swords and daggers, it's the environmental puzzles that will cause some deja-vu. Hopping from stones to ledges and ropes is all familiar stuff though sometimes getting Drake to jump away from the rope instead of just dropping made a simple puzzle aggravating. Some other puzzles pop up now and then where pressing Select will have Drake look in a page of a diary/journal to read clues. They're quite handy though one puzzle involving statues from the Bible were kinda...vague.The other big thing is the combat which is similar to Gears of War in that going out in the open will get you killed quite easily. Instead you take cover behind stones, boxes and columns and pop up to shoot an enemy. It works quite well and save for the lack of a radar when an enemy would all of a sudden pop next to you without you noticing, it's quite fun. But the annoyance comes with enemies' inexplicable ability to take chestful (even headful) of ammo from semi-automatics and handguns and flinch like you just threw a soccer ball at them. On occasion, you'll get an instant kill with a headshot though more often than not, enemies who've had numerous bullets in their chest and head areas don't seem to want to go down. There's some parts that admittedly caused me frustration but some might just work past it.Aside from some parts that made me yell at the screen, Uncharted was quite a blast to play and worth picking despite its rough 10 hour length (though treasures scattered all over will get you hunting).",5,Best blockbuster not in theatres,2008/7/30 0:00
A319SKSB556033,B000UW21A0,"Inspector Gadget Go Go Gadget Reviews""""",1,1,"The globe-trotting adventurer is a familiar character, especially in video games. Lara Croft had her heyday between her first outing in 1996 and the last, terrible, game in 2008. The time was ripe was a new hero to take over and Nathan Drake certainly fits the bill. A descendant of Sir Francis Drake, Nathan has adventure in his blood and is determined to unravel the mystery of his ancestor's final resting place and discover the lost city of El Dorado. It's a well-worn plot, but the jovial Talespin-esque approach and likeable characters keep it fresh and exciting.Uncharted combines run-and-gun, platforming, and puzzle-solving elements as Nathan navigates hot jungles, sunny coastlines, and dark ruins, killing and fighting all the way. You have to wonder about the morality of a hero character who kills hundreds in his quest for personal wealth, but Nathan Drake's scruffy appearance and sarcastic quips will probably distract you from that.The game is relatively hard and is split in 21 chapters without a single loading screen. However, in order to unlock the Platinum trophy you will have to beat the game on 'Crushing' difficulty, which is virtually impossible. The targeting system and movement of the character can be quite clumsy, and precision shooting really comes down to chance for much of the journey.It took me 4 years to unlock 91% of the 47 trophies, and thankfully none of them are based on online play.

After having played the series quite a bit, we decided to go back and play the original to see how it's held up.It's intriguing to wonder if back in 2009 the creators of the original Drake's game realized that they would have such a popular series on their hands. It's tempting to think that they did. The characters, right from the beginning, grab at you. Drake is like a young Indiana Jones. Sully is like Sam on Burn Notice - older, wiser, a great back-up. Then there's Elena who has got intelligence and spunk.The movie mixes in cut-scenes and action, with jungles, puzzles, action sequences and exploration. The humor is laugh out loud funny.Certainly it's easy to say that game makers have progressed since this came out. They have improved how they handle graphics, movement, and enemies. But the basics are all solid here. A variety of weapons, intriguing characters to interact with, collectibles to find, and a fun storyline. You actually grow to care for these characters, with their quirks and foibles. Which is great, of course, since you get more stories in the future to continue the path with them and learn how their lives progress.If you somehow played the games out of order I highly recommend that you go back and play this first one to see where it all began. If somehow you haven't seen the series at all, then absolutely I recommend you start here. Get to know how it all began with Drake, Sully, and Elena. And know that once you begin to form that relationship with them, you're in for a treat, because the subsequent games are quite fun as well.Are there any down sides here? If you hate action-adventure style games where you're jumping over platforms and wall-climbing through dense jungles, then you probably won't like this. It is like Indiana Jones come to life. This isn't a farmville game or a tetris style puzzle.

I do apologize as this can't give to much detail of the game since I just started playing but so far this game makes me very happy to have bought the Ps3 since the game only comes for this console.  The one thing I have always found annoying with most action games is that most times your character will have a melee weapon or gun or some other high-tech weapon but when besieged by enemies or only just one enemy your character would either run out of ammo or the enemy would block your melee weapon so easily it became frustrating that you just couldn't punch your enemy down or something, but now we have an action hero more daring than the iconic Lara Croft and can actually do hand to hand combat if you wish to do so when near an enemy which was a godsend in this game.

Uncharted is one of these, and while it is two years old now and as developed way before the PS3 was announced it was ahead of its time, and still is. On the surface Uncharted may look like a male version of Tomb Raider, but you are completely wrong. Not only are the visuals some of the best in the industry, but the voice acting and characters are what's so believable. The people of Uncharted are every day people who are trying to do heroic deeds and in turn shows their imperfections which makes the game much more believable. Searching around for El Dorado and Sir Francis Drake's footsteps has never been so fun.There are two main elements to Uncharted and these are first the shooting, and the platforming. There isn't much in the way of puzzle solving (the ones that are there are too easy). The shooting mechanics are great since they give you a great sense of desperation thanks to the wonderful animation of Nathan Drake and the way he interacts with the environment. You can see him breathing heavy in panic, ducking with different animations while running, and actually vocally expressing how he is feeling. Third person shooter mechanics do not need explaining, but you do get a good variety of weapons which you are allowed to carry one pistol and one heavy weapon. Grenades can be thrown by changing the arc of the throw with SixAxis, but as far as this SixAxis is used very lightly and not very often. The only flaw in the shooting are the number of enemies you are given which can be way to many during certain situations so the difficulty is unbalanced.In terms of platforming this is the best part of the game. Jumping around is pretty easy, but you can pretty jump on anything you want, and part of Nathan's imperfections show in this since he'll slip off edges or just barely make jumps. Swinging on vines, and walking through a U-Boat submarine could never have felt better. A lot of the game play is broken up nicely with vehicle sections. These include a jeep and a jet ski from which you are shooting from. The Jeep sections are heart pounding, and the beautiful jungle scenery flying by adds to the cinematic experience. When you aren't monkeying around you can look for up to 60 relics to unlock Trophies.One thing that I can't express enough is how beautiful the game is. Which such high-resolution graphics, beautiful HDR lighting, highly detailed textures and realistic water, Naughty Dog really created their second best franchise with this masterpiece. There isn't much to complain about in Uncharted except maybe it's length. With 22 chapters the game can be beaten in 8-10 hours depending on your play style. The replay value is good since you will want to go back and collect more relics to unlock trophies.If I had to really nitpick the game all I can say is that I wish there would have been more SixAxis integration, a more balanced difficulty, more challenging puzzles, and the game could have been a good 5 hours longer, but other than this it is pretty much flawless. If you are getting a PS3 this holiday start with Uncharted because it will make you love your PS3 that much more.",4,The game that took the game world by storm,2012/3/28 0:00

And the designers do an amazing job of seamlessly transitioning from movie sequences to gameplay. The gameplay itself is action/adventure (containing the best adventure elements of a Tomb Raider game with the action mechanics of games like 50 Cent's Blood On The Sand). While not the most expansive shooter or the most clarity driven adventurer out there, this one stands out with the effect of its realism. This is exactly what you'd expect if you were actually hunting treasure. You'd have a gun, pick up a few better ones along the way, and your path wouldn't always be immediately clear. It would take some often frustrating guesswork. I was delighted to find that the enemies in this game had more realism than I've seen in almost any other game. They actually bob and weave! The bad begins with how often an off-center camera angle mixed with some overly simplistic controls can lead to your death. The cover system is majorly flawed. You'll notice this most in later stages when they force you to use it. You have no way to aim without looking down the sights. Therefore do not expect to line up any shots before looking down the sights. The game somewhat accounts for this by auto targeting when you aren't aiming. But this just ends up feeling cheap and suddenly makes you look like a novice gamer. It suffers from the same glitchiness as much as other games where you have to jump from one platform to another. And the camera is no friend in that department. You have control most of the time. But sometimes when it is most crucial, you begin moving only to have the camera move on its own and change the direction you are moving in. Treasure hunting here was not what I'd expected. You have to look around for it, sure. But it's not ever really hidden in any of the places that would seem like good hiding places. Mostly it is just strewn around at random. And why make these secret areas you can access if the treasure of that area is just laying there, visible in the corner when you first walk through the door? Even the load screen bothered me. It's just a spinning coin that doesn't give you any indication of where you stand in the load or if the game is simply frozen. The story (while wonderful) also takes on a sci-fi element towards the end that somewhat took away from the realism of the rest of the experience. All in all, it's a decent game. If the issues I've mentioned had been addressed, I would say it's one of the best. Hell, if all they had done was fix the cover system, I would be glad to give it a 4. But that didn't happen. So expect nice visuals as well as a story and gameplay that can be really good at times. But also expect some serious frustration here and there; thanks to a wonky camera and amateur controls.",3,Great potential and story with too many minor flaws,2011/3/2 0:00
A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000UW21A0,S. Rhodes,3,3,"Pros:+A good challenge overall+Loveable characters+Fantastic voice acting and cinematics+Good sense of humor+Creative puzzles that aren't too difficult to learnCons:-It can feel like the game is holding your hand at times-A short adventure overallAbout a year after the Playstation 3 launched, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune landed down and became one of the first games to really take advantage of what the PS3 could do.  But beyond that, however, Naughty Dog has done a fantastic job creating a simple adventure game that's easy to pick up and learn and yet at the same time can provide a challenge.You play as Nate, a treasure hunter who has just uncovered to coffin of his ancestor Drake.  In the coffin, Nate finds a treasure map leading to the Lost City of Gold: Eldorado.  He's got a journalist tagging along who wants to find a good story as well as a partner named Sully.  Of course, Drake isn't the only one after the treasure.  Throughout his journey he'll not only face the perils of the ruins he discovers but also have to battle pirates.  There's nothing original about the storyline, but the characters are incredibly likeable--particularly Nate himself.  The story and dialog within the story is also incredibly well written.  As you get yourself into certain skirmishes Nate will also give his own commentary which is sometimes humorous.  That's not the only thing that's humorous.  Much of the dialog in the cutscenes is also funny.  It's a game that knows it's clever but is careful not to rub your face in its wit.  It makes a simple story all the more enjoyable.Gameplay is pretty simple to pick up on and play.  For the most part you'll be doing one of two things: Solving puzzles or participating in gun fights.  When it comes to the games puzzles, most of them are pretty clever, but none of them are too hard.  Some puzzles, such as the jumping puzzles, can seem a little threatening, but for the most part Nate does all the jumping automatically.  All you have to be doing is facing the right direction and he usually lands a jump.  This doesn't mean you can't jump too early, but for the most part, Nate is good at grabbing on ledges.  For the most part, gameplay flows incredibly smoothly.The other aspect of gameplay is the gun fights.  Just about every gun fight plays out the same way.  You hide behind an object, you pop out and you shoot at your enemy.  You can carry two weapons with you at a time and each time you down an enemy you can have their remaining ammunition.  While it seems like ammo would be plentiful, it's not really.  Even if you manage to make every shot count your adversaries can take quite a bit of damage.  Luckily there's also melee combat involved.  None of it is hard to pick up and learn, though it's quite surprising how difficult Uncharted can be.  In fire fights where you're surrounded on all sides it can be difficult to find cover to let your health recover.  Not to mention you can run low on ammo.  And despite the melee combat, it can be hard to pull off on a single enemy when you're being shot by three others.  Despite that, when you get the hang of it and you know where to go to get cover, Uncharted can be fun.  It can feel a little repetitive at times, but with the good mix of cutscenes that don't drag on and puzzle elements, there's a good amount of variety.Likewise, you'll never find yourself in too dire need of trouble.  The game is pretty linear for the most part.  Despite all you can see in the environments, it's pretty straightforward.  Should you find yourself lost the game will point you in the right direction.  Just the same, the helpful prompts that remind you how to duck behind cover and how to shoot never stop popping up when it seems like your stuck.  It would feel like the game was holding your hand if you couldn't turn these off, but you can and you're allowed to do things yourself.  If you ever find the game being too hard or too easy, you can adjust the difficulty level on the fly.The strongest aspect of Uncharted is without a doubt the game's stellar production values.  It's quite possibly the best looking PS3 out there.  The detail put into the world you're in is incredible.  There's eagle eye attention to detail.  When Nate goes into water and emerges, for example, the water is actually dripping off his clothes and they look damp and he'll slowly dry off.  Not to mention that the lighting effects are fantastic as well.  There can be slight dips in frame rate, but you may not actually notice them.  The music is also fantastic as it fits the adventure well.  Better than the music, however, is the voice cast.  Every voice suits each character well but they also put a lot of good emotion into it and inject the right tone when it's called for.  The production values are one of the reasons to at least check the game out.While there will without a doubt be some who find the gunplay repetitive, at least the other elements keep the game afloat.  If there was anything wrong with Drake's Fortune, it would be that the game is pretty short.  Aside from that, it's a game that's worth checking out if you're into the Adventure genre.",5,An Amazing Game Overall,2009/1/7 0:00
A2IGEPJJYKMOWK,B000UW21A0,UziHorowitz,2,1,"Listen, I understand that Uncharted 2 refined some elements, which includes but isn't limited to the combat and enemy encounters. Uncharted 2 fixed many gameplay mechanics that weren't as refined in Drake's Fortune. I won't argue otherwise. However, despite getting a more polished sequel -- which is still one of the best games out there -- Uncharted: Drake's Fortune will always remain my favorite in this great series.You ask why this is my favorite if the sequel improved upon fundamental gameplay mechanics? Because this wasn't a globetrotting adventure, but a more self-contained story that includes the jungle environment, a fun story with the most consistent cast of characters to date, etc. The problem I have with the stories in the sequels is that they never felt as compact and tight as Drake's Fortune. Don't get me wrong, they're still great, but Drake's Fortune is pretty much the Indiana Jones game I always wanted.With beautiful graphics, a tremendously told story, and fun gameplay -- which was, arguably, improved in sequels -- Drake's Fortune will always be my favorite Uncharted.",5,My Favorite Uncharted,2012/8/29 0:00

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000X1PE16,"Cloud ...""""",4,4,"Known primarily for overdoing a franchise with multiple releases (see the endless yearly outings of sports titles, EA went a bit against the grain and released 2 original IP's in the fall of last year: Dice's Mirror's Edge and EA Redwood's Dead Space. Whereas the former was at times fun but other times frustrating, Dead Space is just top-of-the-line from head to toe. Everything about the game feels perfectly balanced and even small nitpick worthy issues can't stop it from being an exhilarating ride...at least during the first time.Story: In the near future, such ships exist called planet crackers"" which essentially grab gigantic chunks out of planets and mine them for resources and minerals. When the top ship, the USG Ishimura, goes silent and no contact can be made, in comes Isaac Clarke, an engineer sent in to what they think is just a communication equipment problem. Get in, fix, get out except the ship's crew has changed and not for the better as they're disgusting and deformed creatures hell bent on seeing you dead, often in the most gruesome manner possible.There's really only 2 complaints I can level at Dead Space's story: one, we're told to sympathize with Isaac thanks to a sidestory involving his girlfriend Nicole only Isaac doesn't say a single word throughout the entire story and makes him a bit more autonomous and hard to sympathize with. The second is that the game is essentially a glorified fetch quest only instead of collecting items, you're fixing stuff. Literally every chapter you'll receive reports from either Kendra or Hammond, your shipmates, that something on the ship needs to be fixed lest something bad happen. A chapter where your completely cut off from everybody would've heightened the tension and made you go ""now what?"" but otherwise, you're just errand boy. However thanks to the graphics and the pacing, you'll be quite hooked into the story.Graphics: What makes Dead Space such an immersive and effective game is the graphics since the ship just FEELS possible, as if this thing can actually exist. It's a lot more effective when you take into account the layout, lighting, various facilities and levels and everything from detail in the environments, the gore effects and especially that one part during chapter 4 involving the bridge makes you go ""holy ****"". Larger detail is lost more farther away things are and bodies on the floor have a weird ragdoll quality and it's not uncommon to start shuffling bodies with your feet like they're mannequins.Sound/Music: Equally impressive is the sound mix from the roars, screeches, pipes and cans dropping from...somewhere, this is the game to have if you have surround sound as the sound mix will easily make you paranoid about everything. The voice acting is one of those functional types where no one really excels in their roles but they don't stand out in the awfulness either. Primarily the voice acting comes from Kendra and Hammond who do good jobs for your voice characters. All that's heard from Isaac is his yells during hits, breathing when he runs and being in air vacuums.Gameplay: The first big thing Dead Space does is have no HUD displays anywhere on screen, well at least typical ones. There's no Halo-esque radar or ammo counter or a shield meter in the old-fashioned sense but rather everything's on Isaac's body. His health is a bar that runs up his spine separated into segments, his Statis (slow motion for specific things such as enemies or equipment) is a half-circle while ammo counters are displayed on top of the weapon in a display. Even cutscenes and character meetings don't have a separate cutscene but either come through holographic projections or brief moments where camera shows an action from somewhere else. This helps with the game and makes one wonder why most game designers don't use it more.Instead of traditional weaponry a la shotguns and assault rifles, Isaac carries engineer-type equipment from plasma cutters to rippers and the equipment feels like what one would use in their fixing duties so it's nice that they're functional for killing some beasts. The core of the game is to dismember your enemy, essentially take them apart piece by piece. Take their legs off and make em crawl or take their arms away and leave them attackless. Of course knowing how best to dismember is key since some actually change should you do something and screw you over even more. But with flamethrowers, pulse rifles and melee attacks at your disposal, you're more than well-equipped and that's what makes the game work: it's not difficult per se a la Ninja Gaiden but rather it's an even matchup. You against them and not feel handicapped by anything.With kinesis which acts similar to Half-Life 2's gravity gun where you can grab distant objects or move big things you couldn't otherwise move, there's also the aforementioned stasis which temporarily slows time down for an enemy which is fun since it's for a specific enemy so the annoying one can be slowed while you deal with the lesser types at full speed. Another of the more funner aspects is zero G. Just aim and if you can jump, you'll go flying which'll get you either on the ceiling, walls and all over. It's incredibly fun and having an enemy flying at you is a bit intense. The segments where there's no air are also great since the sound is drastically cut down save for muffled gunfire and yelling from Isaac.My one complaint is that the game isn't as amazing the second time since it becomes a bit more predictable. ""Oh, this is where I get ambushed so better go this way and do that"" and since some of the achievements are most definately multiple playthroughs needed, it doesn't make it chore-like but it drags it down ever so slightly. Whereas Mirror's Edge frequently had great moments mixed in with completely off-the-rails segments and gameplay moments, there's very little that breaks Dead Space. It's not ""scary"" per se and won't make you lose sleep but it's an intense ride.""",5,Bring it on you....deformed...thing!,2009/4/10 0:00
AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000X1PE16,"N. Durham Big Evil""""",1,0,"In terms of survival horror games, Resident Evil 4 had easily worn the crown in terms of scaring the crap out of you.  Key word there was had.  Dead Space is by and far one of the most frightening video games you will ever play, taking the idea of monsters on a space ship"" and upping the ante in nearly every department.  You play as Isaac Clarke, an engineer dispatched to the ship Ishimura after contact has been lost.  It doesn't take long to learn that the crew of the Ishimura have been mutated into horrible creatures, and it's up to you to wreak bloody havoc upon them and learn what happened.  First and foremost, Dead Space features some of the most horiffic creature designs you'll catch in a video game.  These Necromorphs aren't all that easy to take down either, leading up to some just plain awesome boss battles to boot.  What Dead Space manages to accomplish in terms of innovation is also very much worth noting, as the traditional elements like a health meter are featured right on your character via a meter going down his spine, and telling how much ammo you have left can be seen when you raise your weapon into position.  Elements like these make Dead Space an all the more immersive gaming experience, and the game's enthralling story only adds to it.  Technically speaking, Dead Space is a marvel in terms of graphics and sound design, offering so many moments of brilliance amidst the horror.  The game is blood-curdlingly violent, and being able to improvise using your surroundings during battle adds to this as well.  The ship itself is wonderfully designed and gives off a feeling of claustrophobic dread; all of which helps add up to make Dead Space a brilliant and immersive survival horror experience.  If there's any flaws to be found, it's that the mission objectives can get repetitive, but other than that, Dead Space is nearly flawless.  All in all, you are unlikely to play any better, or scarier, survival horror games now or in the near future, and even if survival horror isn't really your thing, you should definitely check out Dead Space regardless.""",5,One of the most frightening video games ever made,2008/11/2 0:00
ADPEAVHFCNLLC,B000X1PE16,Poisoned Blade,0,0,"Dead Space is a combination of BioShock, Aliens, and Resident Evil.  It's not an original game, but it combines all of these elements very well.You're part of a small patrol sent to find out why the communications systems of a planet buster suddenly went dead after finding an alien artifact.  On your arrival, you discover that the crew has been transformed into super-deadly-alien-zombies!The aliens have two purposes:1)  Make Living Things Dead2)  Harvest Dead FleshThe aliens aren't the only problem.  The ship is near an asteroid field and parts of the ship have been destroyed.  Power, Gravity, and Life Support systems are out in parts of the ship.  Assisted by 2 members of your team, via hologram-intercom, you must find a way off of the ship.Gameplay - 9The gameplay is very good.  What sets this game apart from most is that you can access a map that shows you the path to your next objective.  It literally draws a line on the map from your position to where you need to go, so you will never get lost.  You can deviate from the path as much as you want to explore, gather weapons, health, ammo, and unforunately encounter more aliens.  But you will never get lost or stuck wandering around levels like other survival horror games.The weapons are good and fun to shoot.  You have a pistol, a machine gun, a buzz-saw gun, flame thrower, etc...  all of them pefect for dismembering aliens.  The fights with aliens are fair.  It's very rare that you die and it's not your fault.  It's also rare that you die in the same place repeatedly.  If you happen to die, the checkpoints are generous and you never get set back too far.There are weapons, ammo, and health all over the ship.  There are also stores that you can access to buy or upgrade weapons.The aliens come in all shapes and sizes, too.  The combat never gets boring in this game.There are some Zero-Gravity areas.  These are incredibly cool.You also get telekinesis and stasis (which temporarily slows down objects and enemies) for puzzles and combat.Graphics - 10From the flickering lights, to the gore stained walls, to the breathtaking views of space, it all looks great.  The aliens look like creatures from John Carpenters' The Thing.Sound - 10The sound effects will make you jump.  The eerie background music sounds like a mix of the TV Show Lost and the movie Aliens.  It's perfect.Story - 7The reasons you go from objective to objective are good.  The acting is good, but there are a few plot twists that feel a bit odd.Immersion - 10There is no HUD in the game.  Instead, the health is on your character's back.  All of the information that you need to know, shows up as holograms in game.  If you see an item in a dark corner, as you approach it, a holographic window appears telling you what it is and how to pick it up.  Your inventory and map also appear as holograms.  The absense of the HUD makes the game feel more immersive.The camera is pretty close to your character which allows you to be ambushed by aliens and unlike first person games, you can actually see what horrible things are happening to your character.Scary - 9It's scary.The game is rated M for Mature for Violence and Gore and Violent Gore and Gory Violence.  Severed heads, gore, dismembered limbs in zero gravity...  The works.Replay Value - 8The game is composed of 12 Chapters that can take you 8-12 hours to finish, depending on how much exploring you do.  Once you finish the game, you get a ton of upgrades and cash and can replay the game as an action game.There are 4 Difficulty Levels from Easy to Impossible.If you want a Scary Alien Game, you have to pick this one up.

A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B000X1PE16,"Richard Baker BinaryMessiah""""",1,1,"The Good: Amazing and haunting audio/visual roller coaster, new original story is great, tools as weapons!, disgusting creatures, dismemberment is gruesome, amazing boss fightsThe Bad: Not enough weapons, not enough creatures, it endsWell, well, well EA finally pulls itself together. After this and the upcoming Mirror's Edge I think EA finally got some brains that were full of new IP and original content. Dead Space is a superbly gruesome and atmospherically terrifying game that goes above and beyond the call of duty (no pun intended) when it comes to atmosphere, story, and game play ideas. The story is really unique and it's been ages since a great new original story has blossomed in the horror genre. You are Isaac Clarke who is a repair man sent out to the Ishimura to find out why there is no communications on that ship. The ship is known as a Planetcracker"" and is carrying a mysterious relic called ""The Marker"" and Isaac finds everyone aboard dead and the place deserted...well except extremely creepy monsters, a couple crazy doctors, and his girlfriend...yeah its a superb story and it'll keep you hooked throughout, but won't really unfold until the last three levels.Let's go right into game play; you can buy five different weapons (yeah this game NEEDED more weapons) they are the plasma cutter, ripper, flamethrower, force gun, and contact beam, and the line gun. They are all cool weapons yet there is a twist: They're TOOLS not guns. Isaac is a repair man, see, not a one-man-army mercenary or ex-military dude. This guy was NOT trained for combat and he must learn very quickly how to defend himself. This makes the game feel even more creepy and makes you feel more helpless since you have to make due with what you have. What I loved is that everything is displayed visually so there are no meters, bars, or gauges telling you your health and ammo. Everything is displayed on you. You have your health bar which is a bar on your suit, your stasis bar is on your back (more on stasis later), your ammo is displayed holographically when you're using your weapons and so is your flashlight.Everything in the game is easily accessible and the controls are well mapped out. You can use melee combat by stomping on enemies or punching them. While you'll not want to do this since its a bit clunky it saves your butt in hairy situations. The way you kill enemies is by dismembering them to do extra damage. If you shoot their legs off they'll crawl to you, shoot their arms off and they bite you to death, shoot one arm and one leg off they'll still crawl to you, decapitate them and well they'll still try to kill you! If you get overwhelmed just use your stasis and slow them; this is a must do for some creatures like the Twitchers who run ultra fast. The creatures are very disturbing and are probably some of the most sick and twisted things created in a game I've EVER seen. These things are nasty and you just feel the pain when you realize these were all once humans (most of them). There are also lots of cinematic sequences like when a tentacle arm grabs your leg and it's dragging you down a hall while your trying to shoot it off. There are HUMONGOUS boss fights, some turret gun sections etc.You'll NEVER get bored with the game since the scares vary so much. You'll walk down a hall and a guy will be petting his dismembered leg then fall over dead, you'll hear a nurse laugh hysterically and blow her brains out, people will be killed behind bullet proof glass etc. The game has a VERY disturbing atmosphere and you really do get scared with all of the amazing ambient sound effects that will keep you on the edge and make you jump constantly. Dead Space does everything differently from other horror games since its all so surreal because of the way its done. You really do feel abandoned on a ship that once was bustling with life. The graphics are also absolutely amazing; these are some of the best graphics seen so far and they are breathtaking. There's not much I can say except see it for yourself you'll be blown away!There are segments that are zero gravity and vacuums. Zero gravity sections have you jumping around room solving puzzles and shooting things. These are very interesting and changes the pace a lot. When you enter a vacuum you are on an air timer and if you don't have any spare air can you're dead! You can upgrade everything via work benches by finding or buying power nodes. These work like ""trees"" where you have to fill a path to that upgrade with nodes. Each weapon has different upgrade specs and you won't be able to upgrade them all in one play through. In fact it'll take about two play throughs to get all achievements. There is plenty to do in the game and the achievements are not impossible to get (like in FEAR!!! or Burnout Revenge!!!) so don't panic.All I have left to say is that Dead Space is absolutely amazing and I'd give it a higher score if there were more enemy types, more weapons, and just a bit more variety. There's enough to keep you interested through a couple of play throughs and I hope there will be a sequel (wait...it's EA of course there will be!!! Until we hate it...) There are six Dead Space comics available that you can pick up for about $15 for the lot. I HIGHLY suggest reading these since they fill you in about a few weeks before the game takes place. They have the same atmosphere and story telling as the game and they are a really good read. Dead Space is one of the best horror action games made and this will be a piece of gaming history, and I also look forward to the next few sequels.""",5,A game that put scary back into survival horror,2012/3/28 0:00

It's atmosphere help it become a terrifying game that will keep you fully immersed, and maybe keep you up at night.In Dead Space, you play as Issac Clarke, an engineer.  Along with two friends from Concordance Extraction Corporation, you receive a distress call from another ship and decide to investigate.  Upon arriving, however, things have already gone awry.  Aboard the ship is a deadly alien race that has apparently killed much of the crew.  Within minutes of arriving, you're separated from your allies.  Your job is to survive on this ship, reunite with your crew and find a way to escape.  Dead Space won't get any points for having a creative story, but what it lacks in story it makes up for in other areas.There's one thing Dead Space does right immediately.  It sets the tone and atmosphere of the game right away.  The environments are dark and moody and the enemies are horrifying and scary.  From the start, Dead Space is instantly absorbing as a result.  The game does such a good job in its dark atmosphere that it's easy to be absorbed into it and scared.  Needless to say, the game is not for the squeamish.  There's blood and lots of it.Despite its dark tone, Dead Space isn't very hard to pick up and play.  As Issac you'll come across a few helpful weapons and tools to help you out.  However, Dead Space takes the idea of gun toting to a new level.  The enemies in Dead Space are not killed by taking mere shots at them.  Instead the game forces you to shoot off the enemy's limbs in order to kill them.  There's a bit of strategy involved in it as simply aiming for the body doesn't do at any time.  You'll be forced to shoot in the arms and legs in order to kill your enemies. It can take time to get used to the gameplay, but once you do, you'll come to enjoy it.  There's a definite strategic feel as to how to sever your enemies.  In short, it's a widely different approach.  You may find yourself scrounging for ammo from time to time, but for the most part ammunition for your weapons is plentiful.The most interesting aspect of the gameplay, however, may be that everything takes place in real time.  When you're listening to someone's radio transmission or even just browsing the menu, everything is still moving.  This means you could be attacked while selecting a weapon to use in combat or even if you're trying to heal.  This would be a problem if there weren't hot keys for doing the two most important things: healing and reloading.  It keeps you on your toes for the most part.  You can pause the game, at least, but you won't be able to take a look at your items, weapons, objectives or maps while you do it.  There may be times when this can be frustrating, particularly if you get lost or need to know what you're supposed to be doing.  Even when one of the game's tutorials pop up it's in real time.  In the long run it isn't too big of a problem.  In some ways it enhances the games sense of urgency.  Luckily there are plenty of save points scattered throughout the game.Graphically Dead Space is incredible and easily one of the best looking games of this generation.  The action never slows down and there is a lot of attention to detail.  If it weren't for enemies roaming around and trying to kill you, you'd probably stop just to look around and marvel at the visuals.  It really draws you in and makes you feel as though you're part of the game.  The game also has some good physics.  You can kick boxes and containers around on the ground or move bodies.  It's amazing just how much attention is given to the game's environment.The music is also very good.  Just like the visuals, it's dark and moody.  The sound effects are perhaps the best thing going for the game.  The monsters sound just as terrifying as they look.  The voice acting is also a treat.  In terms of production values, Dead Space is a masterpiece.Dead Space isn't a perfect game, however.  For starters, the camera stays a little too close to the action at times.  Beyond that, the controls also feel a little clunky at times such as when you have to turn or when you need to maneuver the camera to pick up certain items.  It isn't a huge hindrance, but it can cause you to take unnecessary damage at times.  Luckily, too, there is plenty of health scattered about.In the end, Dead Space is a masterpiece and raises the bar for the Survival Horror genre.  It's dark, absorbing atmosphere makes it, by far, one of the greatest games in the genre.",5,In Space No One Can Hear You Scream,2008/10/18 0:00

In-game it looks just as stylish although in progressive scan, there's some things like jaggies, minor parts of slowdown and just a feeling of unpolishedness but the game succeeds on style alone as opposed to perfect presentation.Sound/Music: The voice acting is quite good with quite a few swears and funny lines though at times the dialogue's clunky like some of Travis' taunts but other than that, it's just as good as Killer 7's and is quite welcome as opposed to reading it all. The music is just as great as well and if you're a fan of Killer 7 or dance-y soundtracks, I recommend picking it up.Gameplay: Rather than have a on-rails first person shooter, NMH follows more a GTA look with the city of Santa Destroy ripe for exploration which range from gyms (levelling up stats), t-shirt stores, brand new katana models and mini-missions and odd jobs like mowing lawns. This is integrated well and while things get more expensive than your jobs pay out, there's quite a bit to do. Should you go and take on a ranked assassin is where combat comes in. With your beam katana as well as wrestling moves, Travis takes on enemies by pressing A for katana or B for kicking/stunning which allows the wrestling moves. Just before enemy dies, a prompt comes onscreen with an arrow; just wave Wiimote in direction of arrow and Travis will do a special (and quite bloody) kill for cash. Wrestling moves are triggered when enemy is dizzy and upon pressing B, another prompt involving direction with both Nunchuk and Wii-mote so one might do wave both up or down while one half needs all left than all down. It makes combat intuitive enough to get into it quick and its diverse moves and upgrades keep it from becoming stale.But as far as gameplay faults, there's a couple that people will either hate or just minor nitpicks. For one, that game is kind of easy and while enemies will surround you and a boss might be tricky, it's not an overly frustrating game which is welcome but its not challenging and keeps you on your toes. Another complaint is getting money which at times works but the jobs themselves are either boring and not as fun while others can be slightly frustrating.Like Killer 7, No More Heroes will be just as polarizing with some loving and some hating so while I'd recommend you play it since I love it, it's also with a warning of caution but instead of playing minigame inspired Wii games all the time, it's fun to take on something like this and just have a blast doing so.",5,4.5; unique game on a unique system,2008/2/15 0:00
A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000X25GW2,"Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...""",2,1,"A game made by Suda 51, the game maker behind the cel-shaded rail shooter Killer 7, No More Heroes reflects its creator's desire to push boundaries and innovate as much as possible. However, does that mean it stacks up as a game by itself?In No More Heroes, the player takes the role of Travis Touchdown, a 27-year-old fanboy living in a small apartment in California. After obtaining a Beam Katana - essentially a lightsaber - by winning an online auction, Travis decides to become the #1 ranked assassin in the world. The game is divided into two types: Trying to move up the ranks from #11 to #1 by challenging the ranked assassins above you, or working to get enough money to enter an official petition to go after the next assassin.The assassin challenges are the combat segments. You run through an area fighting various low-level goons before reaching the boss - the ranked assassin. Travis' beam katana is the main weapon in combat. It is swung with the A button, but will strike differently depending on if it is in high stance (the Wii remote held straight up) or low stance (the Wii remote held to the side). The beam saber can also be charged up for a larger attack. Enemies who are injured enough are finished off"" by waving the Wii remote in the direction indicated on the screen for a final, bisecting slash. The beam saber has a short battery that is drained by attacking and guarding, and drained even more by a charge attack. Once the battery is dead, neither attacking nor guarding is possible with the beam saber. To charge the battery back up, the Wii remote has to be shaken up and down to ""get the juices flowing again"". Besides his saber, Travis also has an array of unarmed attacks, including punches, kicks, and throws, that can be done without draining the sword's battery. The fighting in the game is fun and decent, with some innovative uses of the Wii remote - it really feels like they're trying to make the Wii remote a part of the fighting and not just a gimmick. However, in terms of gameplay, it's overshadowed by more pure-action games like Ninja Gaiden. On its own, though, it's reasonably fun.The money-gathering parts of the game are significantly less fun. Later in the game, Travis can use his reputation as an assassin to take assassination jobs (which are combat segments), but for the early parts of the game Travis will have to take regular part-time jobs. Everything from mowing lawns to collecting garbage to sweeping for mines is included in this part. They're essentially mini-games; there's only a few of them (nine total), but you have to keep doing them to earn more and more money. They're kind of a drag to do over and over, and really, if you can just do a repetitive activity like this in a game, you might as well do it in real life and earn some real money. Of course, it doesn't seem like it was meant to be fun, anyways.Besides submitting challenges, it's also possible to buy various new items with your money. Travis' entire wardrobe is customizable with new clothing, and in addition he can buy new beam swords to increase his performance. Travis' apartment is the main base of the game; Travis can change options and equipment, as well as simply sit back and enjoy himself by watching tv or playing with his pet cat.The graphics are a neat cel-shaded style, with lots of blood, but in technical terms it doesn't look great. It looks, to be honest, like a Gamecube game more than anything else. Furthermore, the lighting isn't very good, and shadows tend to obscure way more than they should, so it's hard to see things. Overall, it looks really dated, and this tends to detract from the action sequences. The sound is pretty good in voice acting terms but not great music-wise.Overall, No More Heroes has some interesting ideas, but the creators' desires to push boundaries ultimately causes the game to be less fun overall. It seems more like an experiment than a real game, and despite some neat innovations with the Wii remote (including some parts where the remote is held to the player's ear and used as a radio), it's really not that fun of a game.""",3,Interesting Ideas but Issues,2008/10/21 0:00
AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000X25GW2,"N. Durham Big Evil""""",51,43,"From the makers of Killer 7, No More Heroes is the anxiously awaited bloodbath that mature Wii owners have been praying for.  Playing as eccentric assassin Travis Touchdown, you are armed with your trusty beam katana as you set out to become the best in the business.  There is much more to the story than that though, but without giving too much away regarding the game's surprisingly deep and complex story, let's just say that things don't always go as planned for Travis.  The first thing you'll notice are undoubtedly the excellent, cell-shaded graphics that No More Heroes sports, along with the best use of the Wii motion controls to come from a third-party yet.  The game also features some GTA-inspired free roaming with Travis on a motorcycle, and while it isn't as open-ended as one would hope, the game's serious sense of style and just plain insane story and gameplay elements more than make up for it.  The game also has a somewhat jittery frame-rate that can become quite noticable when the action picks up a lot, but this is only a minor complaint thanks to the stylized, over the top action, along with flawless sound design and elements that really take advantage of what the Wii can do, despite the fact that the console isn't a technical powerhouse.  All in all, No More Heroes is the absolute best, original third-party title to debut on the Wii yet, and is an absolute essential purchase for Wii owners craving a mature-themed game that leaves a lasting impression.",5,"Spectacular, the best original third-party Wii title yet",2008/1/23 0:00

NMH has a wonderful story where you play as Travis Touchdown who is a contracted assassin fighting his way to number one. You're boss (who is a sexy blond) drives you forward through the whole list and then there is an awesome plot twist at the end that will keep you hooked. The game is all about the fighting though. You have an awesome beam katana that you can hack and slash people with but hitting the A button and locking (and blocking) with the Z button. when your opponent's life is all the way down an arrow pops up on-screen telling you which way to swing the Wiimote and either slicing his head off with tons of blood spewing or even slicing him in half. The boss fights are all awesome and unique and they are the kind of boss fights that are memorable. They are fast, and you feel like you're really playing a cool anime samurai cartoon.In between these Ranked Battles"" you can get jobs to earn money to pay the entry fee such as collecting coconuts to wiping graffiti off walls. Then after you do a job you can play in assassination missions to earn even more money. There are also customization options such as dressing Travis up to making new weapons. The only issue here is there isn't a lot of options I mean like VERY LITTLE here. You can also cruise around the town Santa Destroy but it's not very fun. It's lifeless dull and boring really.

A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B000X25GW2,Simon,2,1,"No More Heroes is a Nintendo Wii title published in 2008. You play as Travis Touchdown, a stereotypical geek/otaku living out of a suspect motel in Santa Destroy. When you win a beam katana in an online auction, a mysterious hottie suggests using it to carve your way to the top of the United Assassin's Association rankings. Cue violence, gore, and mayhem.This is a game I could talk about all day, an experience so memorable and hilariously unique that any shortcomings are easily overlooked. There's not a lot of games that strike this kind of cord with me, one of the others being the cult hitKiller 7, also helmed by No More Heroes' Suda 51. You can find a little something for every male gamer in No More Heroes, including anime references, wrestling moves, and 80s arcade homages. Heck you main weapon is a Lightsaber - that's gotta be worth at least 100 fantasy fulfillment points right there. And there's also liberal amounts of blood, innuendo, and general butt-kicking, all wrapped in an insanely weird and over-the-top package. What other game can take you from a hardcore assassination mission to mowing the lawn and collecting coconuts for some pocket money?The Wii controls are excellent, saving the motion usage for key gameplay moments like finishing slashes and wrestling moves. Bosses return to old-school levels of skill and pattern memorization, and every fight offers something different. Like Killer 7, No More Heroes uses a cel-shaded look that puts the visual emphasis on style and away from raw horsepower. Voice-acting is top notch - it feels intentionally overacted in that anime dub kinda way and perfectly gels with the tone of the game. Background music is an eclectic mix of rock, techno and hip hop that rounds out the presentation.So what doesn't work? The GTA-style sandbox world is rather barren - there are no random side missions to perform, and it's occasionally tedious to travel around the map. Along with that, you can't jump back in immediately and replay a mission if you fail one - you have to travel back to where you received the assignment, re-activate it, then return to the spot to trigger the mission again. Some streamlining would've been appreciated.But overall No More Heroes is just too much fun to deduct marks for these shortcomings. The game is many things, but most of all it's an intelligent, mature-rated game, a genre the Nintendo Wii is very lacking in. You have no right to complain about the lack of good games on Wii if you haven't tried this yet.",5,You Must Experience No More Heroes,2009/5/19 0:00
A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000X25GW2,S. Rhodes,35,28,"Pros:+A tolerable storyline+Fantastic Gameplay+Beautiful Cel-Shaded graphics+Good soundtrack+Good voice oversCons:-Incredibly short game-Side jobs inbetween the main missions aren't exciting-The game is on the easy side-Despite good Cel-shaded Graphics, more detail could've been put into Santa DestroyNo More Heroes is a stylish game.  A game that isn't aimed at the kids by any means but the adult gamer instead.  It manages to do so.  The humor is crude and the game is incredibly violent.  Parents, that's your warning.In No More Heroes you play the role of Travis Touchdown.  As Travis Touchdown you are the newest member of the United Assassins Association.  After the battle with the rank ten assassin, Travis decides that he has to be number one.  Your goal is pretty simple.  Defeat all the assassins and become the number one assassin in Santa Destroy.No More Heroes lives up to its M Rating perfectly well.  Much of the core gameplay is centered around slashing through the levels to the boss at the end.  Your main weapon is a Beam Katana.  Despite how some third party games have faired in the past, No More Heroes makes excellent use of the Wii's controls.  The A button simply swings your Beam Katana while B is used to make kicks.  Whenever you reduce an enemies life gauge down, the game enters deathblow mode.  In Deathblow Mode, an arrow appears on the screen and you must wave the Wii Remote in that direction to execute a killing blow.  Despite which way the arrow points you can really swing the Wii Remote anywhere.  There's more to the motion sensor controls.  You can grab enemies and perform wrestling moves by shaking the Wii Remote and Nunchuck, and you can get into weapon clashes where you must wave the Wii Remote in order to win.  These moments are involving.  The game has a fine balance between the motion sensor controls and the normal everyday gameplay.After your first mission and you're officially admitted into the UAA, you'll have to start paying to partake in the games main missions.  This is where No More Heroes slows down considerably.  The rank missions are expensive.  There are ways to make money around Santa Destroy by doing part time jobs for people, but they're hardly fun.  They're mundane jobs like collecting coconuts or mowing lawns.  You can do assassination jobs for the UAA which will allow you to be involved in more action, but these missions go by quickly.  Finally, there are missions you can go to where the objective is to kill all the bad guys without getting hit once.  These missions, however, are over in a flash.Even worse is exploring Santa Destroy itself.  You can cruise around on your stylish bike but there's really nothing to do in Santa Destroy.  You can go train around or buy some clothes to change into or you can buy parts for your Beam Katana.  Unfortunately, Santa Destroy is a pretty boring place.  You can't interact with the denizens and the city is actually relatively empty.  You can also hang around your apartment and watch videos to learn new wrestling moves or play with your cat and the like.However, when you get to play the main missions, the game is a lot of fun, and the missions are long and satisfying, especially the boss battles at the end.  The bosses are some of the most fun to be had in the game.  They aren't really that hard, however.  In fact, the entire game isn't that hard.  It's also pretty short.  Any devoted gamer should be able to finish the game within a couple of days.In terms of graphics, No More Heroes opts for style over substance.  The cel-shaded graphics look good.  A few nostalgic 8-bit moments come out as well, which is obviously part of the style.  Despite how good the graphics are, much more could've been done with it.  Particularly with the outdoor environments.  At least the game sounds good.  With some catchy tunes and good voice overs.  There are moments when the dialog can be grating but it's tolerable nonetheless.No More Heroes is one of the best titles you can buy on the Wii.  While the moments in between missions are slow, the main game itself is fantastic with some good production values.  A little more could've been done to improve the game overall, but the end result is fantastic.",4,Slick and Stylish,2008/1/31 0:00
A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000XJNTNS,,0,0,"Mario Kart Wii is the latest release in a long line of very popular games. You can play with friends, play online, and race in teams or alone. It is really quite fun and addictive!I should admit up front that I have always adored the Mario Kart series from the very beginning. You race around in little karts of various sizes, with classic Nintendo characters at the wheel, on super fun and imaginative courses. You try to get first place while bashing and zapping your enemies into submission.The Wii version brings more courses, more characters, and even motorbikes to the mix! I love bouncing across mushrooms, worrying about the rising waters, leaping into the air in the arena stages, and generally having fun.The beauty of these games is they work well for all ages and all styles of gamer. They aren't violent"". All you're doing to your enemies is causing them to spin on banana peels or zap into a small version of themselves. You're popping their balloons, or gathering up coins.You can play on opposing teams, or you can be on the same team and play against the AI enemies. So if it's a parent with a child, they can team up together and help each other out.Yes, there's single player, but to be honest it's multiplayer that is really a lot of fun. If anything single player is the way to train up your skills so that you can be good at multiplayer. With the online component so you can play with friends around the world, there's little excuse not to have some friendly team-based action!The only real downside is that to unlock new characters and karts you MUST play single player. Why?? Why not have it be something you can do in single or multi-player? I really love playing this with others and just don't enjoy playing it alone. It seems like a chore / grinding mission to have to sit down and ""force yourself"" to play alone just to get some extras.Still, some of these courses are just brilliant and I love playing them. The Wii controls are very intuitive for the racing, especially if you get the wheel add-on. You can use an old style controller too if you really have been hooked on those button combinations.All in all, an awesome game that they did very well for the Wii. Highly recommended!""",5,I Love the Entire Kart Series - Great for the Whole Family,2009/1/18 0:00
A2TCG2HV1VJP6V,B000XJNTNS,,0,0,"You know, I remember when I had Mario Kart 64 for the Nintendo 64 a long time ago. And then my little brother was born years later. He actually tried playing the game once, but since he just went right into it, the onscreen character (Mario) just steered around and around. My mom was watching, and she said that they should make a steering wheel for something like this"". Guess what? Nintendo went to that with the much-later-released Mario Kart Wii.The play control for Mario Kart Wii actually feels much better than previous installments due to the excellent Wii Wheel, which gives you a really nice grip for the standard Wii Remote. Don't want to play with these innovations? Then you can just relax and play with a Gamecube controller!The game, like all the other Mario Karts, offers lots and lots of fun and unique tracks that all play differently from each other, thanks to the brilliant environments in each and every one of those tracks. Like Mario Kart DS, MKWii brings back a mixed bag of tracks from previous Mario Karts as well. You can go find some images or videos online to see what some of these tracks are, and I'm pretty sure that will persuade you to go buy the game immediately.But I'm not finished yet! Let's talk about the Battle modes. Now, MK players should be familiar with this, as it's also been in every Mario Kart. But here, you get to play against the computer players (or friends AND computers)! When it comes to collecting the most coins or eliminating each other, the Battle mode is another reason why this game is golden.Not ONLY do you get to battle and race with 11 computer players, but you can PLAY ONLINE via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, in those two modes! This means you get to play with bunches of strangers from across the world! Sure, there's signs of hackery, but not ALWAYS. There are only few times where things like that occur. Otherwise, the online play is great and rarely lags (if not at all)!And to top it all of, you can play as a Mii (You must unlock that first, but whatever). C'mon! You know you want to race around with Mario characters as Captain Falcon, Chuck Norris, Steve Urkel, Sonic, Pikachu, Mickey Mouse, etc (Depending on what Miis you can find on the Check Mii Out Channel or whether you're an excellent Mii artist)! Besides, even without the Mii feature, Mario Kart Wii is still some of the best fun you can have for your Wii console.""",5,Nintendo certainly knows how to spruce up a franchise,2012/1/8 0:00

With 2005's Mario Kart DS being an incredible game, Mario Kart Wii has a lot to live up to.  In many cases it does.  There are a few setbacks, though, but it doesn't separate it from being a fun game nonetheless.As usual, the game consist of several drivers and like the DS version, they each have an array of karts to choose from.  There are now 24 different racers.  Lightweights, mediumweights and heavyweights.  Some racers you'll have to unlock, and you can even race using your Mii.  All characters also have a choice of 12 karts, and for the first time you can use bikes as you race.There are 32 courses to race on in Mario Kart Wii.  Half of which are brand new courses while the other half are from previous outings.  You can play with friends and race in vs. in direct competition or on teams.  You can also do single player and race the Grand Prix.  Either way, you'll have to race to unlock new cups and characters. The new courses are incredibly fun and very well designed.  There are also twelve competitors in a race instead of eight  Like in previous installments there are also a good deal of items you can collect when you go through the races.  Classic items like Lightning, Boost Mushrooms and shells are back.  But there are also new items thrown in there like the Pow Block, a Lightning Cloud and the Mega Mushroom from New Super Mario Bros. in there thrown in for good measure.  As usual, you get more helpful items the further behind in a race you.  They add a lot of variety to the game as a whole.There are also battle modes.  The classic balloon battle where you'll diminish a player's balloons and there's a coin battle where you'll have to collect coins.  In both battle setups you roam around grabbing item boxes to pummel your enemies.  Up to four people can battle at a time and there are twelve in a match.  The other players will be controlled by the computer  However, of all the Mario Karts, the Wii version certainly has the weakest battle mode.  You're forced into teams rather than having an all out battle and they're also timed.  It's not as much fun.  While they bring some classic battle courses, it would be nice to battle your friends in a free for all.  The AI controlled characters also aren't all that smart.  It makes the battle less fun, especially by yourself.Nintendo has incorporated many ways in which you can control Mario Kart.  There is, of course, straight motion sensor controls.  The game comes with a wheel to play with, but you don't need the wheel in order to use the Wii Remote as a wheel.  This is perfect for Mario Kart Wii and is incredibly user friendly.  If the wheel isn't working for you, you can also use the regular Wii Remote and Nunchuck setup or you can use the Classic Controller or the Gamecube Controller.  Regardless of which control scheme you use, they're all pretty tight.  While the wheel is nice, it takes a while to get used to, especially if you've been playing Mario Kart since the Super Nintendo days.Mario Kart for the Wii is fun but it suffers from one huge setback, especially in single player.  There are times when the game can be a test in frustration.  When racing, the amount of items you can be bombarded with at once is a little over the top. Especially if you go through the race in first place.  There are many moments where you'll be hit by one item and find your footing only to be hit by another item instantly (and sometimes you won't even find your footing).  This has always had the potential to happen in Mario Kart, but in the Wii version it happens regularly.  In one race for example, I was pounded by a Red Shell, Pow Block and Lightning all at the same time, losing my lead and the race. This is even more frequent on higher CC levels.  A little breathing room between being pummeled would've been nice.  But the worst part about this element, is that getting first place in several races is based more so on luck rather than your actual racing skills.  Whatever you do in one race to get 1st place, doesn't usually work on another.  This is easily the biggest problem with Mario Kart Wii.On the other hand, the Wi-fi in Mario Kart Wii shows that Nintendo is beginning to take online gaming seriously.  There's a lot of options and a lot of freedom.  While you still have to deal with friend codes, that's hardly a problem when you finally start sharing records, racing and battling online.  It all works really well.  You might experience some lag, but if you've got a good connection it probably won't be heavy.  The game also gives you the option of installing the Mario Kart Wii Channel on your Wii.  You can get on that and check rankings any time you want.  Installing the channel also makes it so you don't have to insert the game to take a look at the latest rankings.Mario Kart is a good looking game, but certainly not the best looking out there for the Wii.  It's got some very well designed tracks and happens to be a good looking game.  It's just hard not to expect it to look a little more detailed and fleshed out.  The game never slows down, though and consistently runs smoothly.  On the whole, though, Mario Kart Wii still looks better than many games out there on the Wii.  Just not up to snub with other incredible looking games like Super Mario Galaxy.  Luckily, Mario Kart Wii doesn't have to look groundbreaking and new.  It just has to play well, and it does.  Most of the music is quite forgettable, though.  None of it sounds bad, just not catchy.  However, in terms of sound, the voices will probably annoy you after a while.  You can only hear characters cry after losing or scream and yell during jumps so much before it finally gets on your nerves.  You might get used to it, but it will take some time.Mario Kart for the Wii is certainly fun.  It's a great game that's been very well built up.  The only major problem is that the Battle Modes aren't as worthwhile as previous installments and that racing against the computer can be a test in frustration from time to time.  It's still a fun game and going online is also a lot of fun.  Any Mario Kart fan will be glad to pick this up and newcomers will find comfort in the ease of picking it up.",4,A Good Entry to the Series,2008/4/27 0:00

A36UKFV79879MD,B000XJNTNS,,3,2,"Anyone who put a few hours of play time into this game will realize that it's easier to get into than past Mario Kart titles, mostly purists will sense this right away. Nintendo made this title with the casual gamer in mind to get the most attention and for the most part it pays off.Mario Kart lets you play through several game modes where you pick a character, pick a kart or motorcycles (new to the franchise), pick a stage (16 classic tracks from past MK titles and 16 brand new tracks) and then you race for 1st place against 11 other CPU racers. Along the way, you can pick up several power ups to help you or hinder your competition as well as multiple ledges to perform speed boosts. As you go through the single player mode, you start off at the lowest class (50 cc) and earn the right to unlock the 100 cc class (cars go faster) and the 150 cc (cars go the fastest.) Races take place in the form of Cups"" featuring tracks of various themes. Of course, Nintendo always pack in extra content waiting to be unlocked when you fulfill certain conditions. In the end you can unlock secret characters, karts and motorcycles. Anything you unlocked in the single player mode can be used in the online multiplayer modes, which is where you can race up to 11 other people from across the world. Win your races and you win rank points and improve your status online.The PROS: graphics, sounds and music. There are lots of characters to use. There are lots of karts, bikes and characters to unlock. The controls are very easy to use and you have a choice of Wiimote and Nunchuk, Classic Pro controller, Wii Wheel (included with game) or Gamcube controller as your means to control the game. 4 player support is available so you can play with your friends. Online multiplayer is fun and works (unlike the online multiplayer featured in Super Smash Bros Brawl.)The CONS: Remember when I said earlier the casual gamer can get into this game? It's because the overall difficulty of this game in general is low, EXCEPT for the cheap A.I. on the highest difficulty level. Racing in the 150 cc means dealing with the cheap, cheezy, rubber band A.I. of the CPU racers (very frustrating at times.) Some single player modes are not available in the multi-player modes. And yes, hackers have found a way to boost their stats and snag power ups without actually acquiring them so beware whenever you race online for any funny activity.I recommend this title because it is generally fun and anyone who plays it will keep on playing for years to come. I, myself, was never a fan of Mario Kart until I picked this one and I unlocked everything and still play it online.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000XJNTNS,"Michael Kerner Michael Kerner""""",261,227,"Undoubtingly, Nintendo has really showed more muscle within their games for the Wii this past year. With games that really stretched beyond the imagination for fans like Super Mario Galaxy, which re-defined Mario alone in adventures, and the battle smashing action of Super Smash Brothers Brawl that dominated fans hearts all around the worls, Nintendo really shows what it takes to make great video games. But, that also can be said with the Mario Kart series, which finally makes it debut on the Wii. But, following the innovation that Mario Kart DS had from the Nintendo DS wasn't so easy, largely because it was the first DS handheld title to use the Wi-Fi online gaming to an outrageous excitement for gamers all around the world. Now, it is time for the Wii to take that on and race to the checkered flag.Mario Kart Wii for the Nintendo Wii, brings in all that fast-paced excitement racers have wanted and even more. The game adds a whole lot of new and exciting features to use. You can now race as many as 12 racers online through the online gaming, and bring the action over the top, and use that skill and excitement on over 40 different tracks: 10 battle tracks and 32 exciting race tracks that are both new and featured from the earlier Mario Kart games like D.K. Jungle Highway and Sherbet Land from Mario Kart 64. The new tracks are also exciting that will have you racing and bouncing on top of mushrooms from the all-new Mushroom Gorge, and have you crusing the shopping malls and racing down fligts of escaltors with the brand new Coconut Mall course, or racing across the tree trunks of the new Maple Leaf Highway. Every single track is great for beginners and die hard Mario Kart fans of all ages.The gameplay also has a few new surprises, as you not just rave in karts, you also get to race on motorbikes too, bringing more action and variety to each of the players delight. There are also a few new power-ups here too including the Mega Mushroom, from the DS game New Super Mario Brothers, which makes your racer giant-sized, so you can squash your opponents on your way to the checkered flag, and the lightning cloud which shrinks you down to a tiny racer, so you squeeze underneath your opponents and take them by surprise. There also are a few new characters here to unlock in the game as well. You can choose to race with the classics like Mario, Yoshi, Bowser and Luigi, and 6 hidden characters to unlock and master like Rosalina from Super Mario Galaxy, Funky Kong and Diddy Kong from Donkey Kong Barrel Blast and even Bowser Bones (the skeleton Bowser boss from New Super Mario Brothers.)The control is also a bit new here, with the use of the Wii Wheel. The wheel is easy to setup and hooks right onto the Wii remote. You can steer your racers easily through each and every race by turning your wheel left and right, and performing nifty stunts like a wheelie or a 360 on a jump. While the control with the Wii Wheel takes a lot to get used to for veterans, there are others ways to control the game. Like Super Smash Brothers Brawl, gamers can also use the Wii & nunchuck controls, or the classic controller and even the Nintendo Gamecube controller, so veterans can feel more comfortable in anyway they want to race. The graphics here are also well-designed, by bringing new excitement in restoring the classic courses, and a lot of great surprising new features that are the delight to anyone who loves the Mario Kart games.All in all, Mario Kart Wii is definitely one of the best games I've ever enjoyed for the Nintendo Wii. I absolutely loved the need for plumber speed, and it shows in each and every race. This is definitely a must buy for your Wii video game library, that is sure to be a thrilling race and not even close to wiping out anytime soon. So start your Wii-motes, because the race is not ever going to stop.Graphics: ASound: A-Control: B for the Wii Wheel; B+ for the Wii & nunchuck controllers, A for the Classic and Gamecube ControllersFun & Enjoyment: A- for solo gamers; A for multiplayer actionOverall: A-",5,Racing To The Checkered Wii Flag,2008/4/27 0:00
AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000XJNTNS,"N. Durham Big Evil""""",31,25,"Mario Kart has just about always been a safe bet in terms of video game fun, and the eagerly anticipated Mario Kart Wii is certainly no exception.  Mario Kart Wii features a large selection of tracks, of which are brand new and remastered tracks from previous games in the series to boot; all of which are well designed and fun to race, albeit the classic tracks aren't nearly as stylisticly designed as the new ones.  The addition of motorcycles surprisingly works well, and despite a change in some of the game's old mechanics (drifting has never been easier to perform), the game works and races very well.  Most notably is the use of the included Wii Wheel, which surprisingly responds quite well and feels very good as well.  Though it may take some getting used to at first, Mario Kart Wii also supports just about every controler available for the Wii, which in itself is a big plus.  The game as a whole is easy to get into, the online play is well done, the items (while more unbalanced than ever) are imaginitive, and of course, the multiplayer is spectacular fun.  All in all, you really can't go wrong with Mario Kart Wii, which is yet another spectacular triple-A title to come from Nintendo, and another essential pick up for your Wii.",5,Just plain awesome,2008/4/28 0:00
A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000ZK6950,"Cloud ...""""",1,0,"You know, after awhile it does seem to sink in: I just don't get fan expectations. They'll argue over anything and everything, no matter how tiny (the Superman Returns"" apparently got negative feedback because his cape was the wrong shade of red...ugh) or quite simply what was accepted once is renounced now. With Resident Evil 4, the series changed the trademark static camera angles and offered fully 3D environments and not only improved the series in every conceivable way, it was a kickass title to boot. So the disappointment fans and even reviewers feel about the latest entry is kind of baffling but then again the Remake was seen as an excellent addition to the franchise whereas the similar Resident Evil Zero, which also had an additional partner, was seen as stale. So after 4 years and endless amount of hype, does 5 prove to be the best Evil of them all?Story: With Umbrella completely finished (seen in the Umbrella Chronicles Wii game), the biochemical terrorist attacks have surfaced still so the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance, or BSAA, is formed with 2 immediate recruits: Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine, both survivors of Umbrella-related incidents. But when Jill is presumed dead after a mission yet no body is found, Chris heads to Africa to hunt for Irving who's started another terrorist action. Along with African BSAA agent Sheva Alomar, Chris will have to travel deep into the African countryside to get to the bottom of everything.Graphics: I'll say it right up front: Resident Evil 5 is probably the most graphically stunning game available right now. Whereas Gears of War 2 is no slouch, everything you can think of and this game seems to have excelled: lighting, character animation and textures, special effects, the in-game cinematics and on and on. The amount of detail in each character can be seen in unlockable figurines which really hits its stride showcasing some of the boss fight creatures and seeing detail up close. I noticed a bit of screen tearing but honestly, I noticed it maybe once every couple of hours so hardly worth any concern.Sound/Music: Ask anyone who's been playing Resident Evil games for years will know one thing: the voice acting has frequently been laughable. Even the remake had a couple of lines that were iffy. 5 improves on it and there's barely any lines or characters that make me go ""ugh, back to normal""...well that is except for Irving, who is just bad. The music is also quite moody and really kicks into overdrive and makes bigger encounters like boss fights all the more epic. Essentially, this is a more cinematic Resident Evil. My one slight complaint? Not as awesome save room music.Gameplay: We all know the complaints so might as well say them: tank controls, lack of strafe, no jump back and inability to move to different sides of cover...well okay that's a new feature but honestly it does get old which is a plus and an annoyance. At times it would've been great to roll backwards and shoot instead of quickturn, run, quickturn, shoot by which time, enemies probably are within 5-8 feet of you anyway. While Capcom says it adds to the tension, control-wise this is either one of those ""well what'd you expect from an RE game?"" things or ""wish they'd finally change it"". Honestly I'm so used to the controls thanks to RE4 that I never cursed the game for not allowing me the ability to do something but that being said, would've been nice to add at least some features.The big addition to 5 is co-op where you're rarely separated from your partner and even in the same room, they're always somewhere nearby. This needs a fantastic AI however Sheva is adequate though not entirely flawless. She'll frequently shoot you in the back instead of relocating to the side, she'll stand in front unlike Ashley who ducked or ran behind you and she has a habit of reloading at awful times (like right in front of a chainsaw-wielding dude), you can't plant her somewhere to provide cover fire and giving her a handgun is just bullet-wasting. However healing you tends to take top priority and she's a remarkably excellent shot with a rifle. Most will use her as a 2nd inventory trunk but in combat she works but then she frustrates.This is where co-op mode comes in. With split-screen, system link and online, a buddy can play as Sheva which makes for a more tactical approach to fighting such as cover fire, distraction and the like. You can locate any chapter you want, specify the difficulty and even select the right country for a more quicker connection. Only problem is that it's not like Gears of War 2 where you can select where in the level you want to start. Keep in mind, chapter completion achievements only popped up for me when I either single-play or co-op an entire level start to finish so you can't get halfway, hit save point before difficult part, and switch to co-op. So it would've been nice to say ""find all chapter start"" players instead of just being dropped randomly.One thing that Resident Evil games frequently had was replay value which usually involved speed runs. Well while one exists, RE5 expands on this considerably, especially if you want to 1000/1000 this sucker. Basically there's figurines which you can access via chapter completion, BSAA medallions hidden in the game (similar to getting the Punisher handgun in RE4) or upgrading a weapon fully. Then there's unlockable costumes, infinite ammo, and the ever-popular Mercenaries mode. Let's just say for completionist people, RE5 will keep you very busy. Hopefully with DLC, they can add more character or stages to Mercenaries and make it even fatter but there's still plenty of stuff to do to keep you interested.BTW, for the collector's edition: you get a BSAA patch for a jacket, a totally non-Chris Redfield look-alike figurine, a making-of disc and a Tricell messenger bag as well as a Africa-shaped pendant. For those who love to buy Collector/Limited editions just to have the biggest edition this isn't really an absolute must-have but it's sure cool to have all these goodies.Resident Evil 5 for me so far represents the last game for awhile that I'd consider a day one purchase as others are simply ""I'll check it out down the line"" types. It's Game of the Year contender for me though so early in the year and with so many complainers, might not win but after the great Street Fighter IV, Capcom seem to be on a roll.""",5,Team up against a new kind of horror,2009/3/16 0:00
AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000ZK6950,"N. Durham Big Evil""""",2,0,"When Resident Evil 4 was released back in 2005, it was exactly what Capcom's beloved survival horror series needed: a kick in the tail.  Completely overhauling the series' archaic controls and trite puzzles, Resident Evil 4 ended up being one of the absolute best action games to ever see the light of day.  Now Resident Evil 5 is finally here, and from a technical standpoint, the game is a sight to behold.  These may be in fact the best graphics to be seen in any game on the market today, with beautifully rendered visuals that are simply eye-popping.  The core mechanics from Resident Evil 4 remain intact here, as you play as RE1 hero Chris Redfield and new character Sheva; both of whom are investigating the African nation of Kijuju, and eventually are faced with hordes of infected villagers, mutants, monsters, and other nasties, including good 'ol Wesker.  The game is loaded with enough balanced moments of action and tension, and having a partner only makes things even better.  Seriously, adding a partner opens up some new dimensions to the gameplay that helped make RE4 so good, using teamwork to take down the baddies and watch each other's backs as well, which simply just makes the game more fun.  The only true flaws of Resident Evil 5 lie in its online capabilities.  Online co-op has it's share of problems, including not being able to exchange weapons with a teammate, as well as having to wait for the host to restart from a previous checkpoint or get to a new one before jumping into the action.  Still, flaws aside, Resident Evil 5 is a sheer blast of an action game and a more than worthy follow-up to Resident Evil 4.  It isn't perfect and doesn't leave the lasting impression that RE4 did, but it remains a stunning technical achievement that delivers the goods, and with the promise that Capcom will be re-vitalizing the series once again in the next installment, the best may very well be yet to come.",4,A more than worthy follow-up to Resident Evil 4,2009/3/22 0:00
ADPEAVHFCNLLC,B000ZK6950,Poisoned Blade,0,0,"Resident Evil 5 is a prettier version of Resident Evil 4 with more emphasis on cooperative play.  It's part shooting gallery and part action film, but it's about as scary as a Die Hard Movie.Concept: 9/10Chris Redfield is back and this time he has a sexy gun toting partner named Sheva.  You can play Coop with a friend on split screen, or over Xbox Live, or the AI can control Sheva.  Chris' and Sheva's military mission becomes personal when they find out Wesker's experiments killed thousands.Story 7/10The weakest part of the game is the story.  It's well told.  The cutscenes are expertly acted, animated, and rendered.  There are optional files that the player can read at their leisure about the experiments that turned people into blood frenzied zombies.  But it's Wesker... AGAIN.  I feel like I've been killing Wesker for 15 years now.  I really wish Capcom would come up with a new story instead of recycling the same story in different settings.Graphics 10/10The graphics are outstanding!  Hordes of zombies charge at you through the dusty roads of a shanty town.  Dynamic explosions and blur effects fill the screen!  The characters look great!  The camera work in the cutscenes is top notch.  The visual effects highlight the action!  Graphics can't get much better than this!Gameplay 8/10The gameplay is the same as Resident Evil 4, but some finesse has been added.  You aim and shoot at hordes of zombies, while trying to conserve ammo.  You can also try and make the most of your environment by using hazards and obstacles to your advantage.  Because the new additions to the series focus on Cooperative Gameplay, you can combo attacks with your partner.  If they shoot a zombie, the zombie performs its hit animation and that allows you to attack it with a devastating punch or kick.  Two Players can work together to take out a group of zombies and conserve a lot of ammo if they coordinate their attacks well.  This level of precision gameplay really encourages Players to work as a well-oiled machine.Levels 10/10The Levels in Resident Evil 5 are outstanding!  They're varied, they're beautiful, and they're designed to prevent you from getting lost.  From shanty towns, to ancient ruins, to scientific laboratories, the level progression makes you feel like you're progressing through an exciting story.  There are vehicle chase sequences, fun puzzles, frantic battles, and epic boss fights. Strategically placed landmarks and objective markers always point you in the right direction, so you never feel lost or frustrated.You are graded on your performance in the levels, based on deaths, accuracy, kills, and time.  You can replay levels to stockpile items, cash, or to improve your grade.  At the end of each level or after a continue, you can manage your inventory by buying new items, upgrading weapons, or storing items in a virtual locker.AI 8/10Sheva is great most of the time.  She saves your life quite a bit, but she also uses healing objects a little too fast.  She can hold her own in a fight and you can give her commands like COVER (conservative mode) or ATTACK (use more ammo).  She's really great at gathering items while you're fighting or exploring.  At any time, you can ask her to give you one of her items or give her some of yours, too.  There are a few parts of the game where Sheva can get insta-killed (especially in the beginning), causing you to start the level over, but it's not her fault.  It's more of a gameplay issue rather than an AI issue.The enemy AI is good, not great.  The enemies are pretty convincing as enraged zombies, but there are times when they get hung up on corners or walk in circles.  If your glass is half-full, you can imagine that they're just acting more zombie-like.Sound  9/10The voice acting, SFX, and Music are all very good.  If you want to get the most out of this game, playing it in surround sound will put you in the center of the action!Interface 8/10Both Chris and Sheva have 3x3 Square inventories and you can hotkey the 2,4,6,8 positions by pressing up, left, right, and down on the D-pad.  Everything takes up 1 space, whether it's a weapon, ammo, or a healing item.  The inventory management works well almost all of the time.  The downside is when you and Sheva only have 1 space each and you find a Red Herb and a Green Herb.  You literally have to do this in real time:Pick up Red Herb (if you pick up Green first Sheva may use it), Call Sheva, Give her the Red Herb, Pick Up the Green Herb, Exchange an item with Sheva to get the Red Herb, Highlight the Red Herb, Combine it with the Green Herb.  Doing this while you're being attacked can get annoying.  The other reason why this is annoying is that Red Herbs can only be combined with Green Herbs... so why isn't it automated?!  Does the game really need me to play inventory micromanager for 30 seconds to make a healing item?!  How does this enrich my gameplay experience?!Areas Needing Improvement (aside from the Inventory)If you hold the Left Trigger to aim your weapon, you can't move... not even a little bit and this gets really annoying.  You have to turn around, run 2 steps, then turn around again, if you want to step back and fire.  This and the Inventory Issues feel restricting for the sake of being restricting.Also, to slash with the Knife, you have to hold LB, and then press RT to slash the knife.  You can only do 1 thing with the Knife, so why can't I just press LB?!Overall Resident Evil 5 is a great single player or cooperative action game.  It deserves to be in your Xbox 360 collection.  But horror fans should understand that this is not a suspenseful horror game.  It's an exciting action game with big explosions, a hail of gunfire, and witty banter.  Even the soundtrack is more befitting of an action game than a horror game.The game is rated M for Violence, Gore, and Language.Buy it if you loved Resident Evil 4, you want a Great 2-Player Game, you can appreciate a great graphics, or you're a fan of action-packed-actiony-action and you need to kill Wesker just one more time.If you're looking for a horror game, Silent Hill:  Homecoming, Dead Space, and even Gears of War 2 are scarier.",5,"GREAT ACTION GAME, Horror, not so much...",2009/5/9 0:00
AFV2584U13XP3,B000ZK6950,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),7,4,"I got this game just yesterday and have found myself wowed and amazed at how stunning the graphics and game play of this newest release truly is.  The first is that if you've played RE4 the controls for arming, targeting, and firing are almost the same is the previous game which makes it a little easier,  and the second is that unlike the said RE4 you actually have a partner Sheva Alomar that helps you out in problematic unlike Ashley Graham(RE4).  The camera angle is also just like RE4 which looks over the shoulder of the character Chris Redfield when moving, running, or shooting.  The enemies are also as you probably guessed similar to the zombie like creatures of RE4 with the alien like heads popping out of certain infected people when you shoot them.  The extras are many and it'll take a while I think for anyone to unlock them all,  here's a little fun thing as well unlike RE4 this game saves in chapters that allow you to play any level you have finished again and again if you wish, you can also view the video cutscenes from levels you've also finished in the extra menu area.

Rhodes,24,16,"Pros:+Stellar graphics+Really Fantastic Gameplay+An easy to follow and absorbing story+All around good sound and music+For Resident Evil, the voice acting is all right+Cooperative play is done really wellCons:-Limited Inventory is kind of a pain-A more subjective con: Some Resident Evil fans might not like that the game focuses a lot more on action rather than on horror. There are still some gruesome moments, but you won't be scared or put on edge in many moments through the game. This will be an experience that changes from gamer to gamerWhen Resident Evil 4 dropped down in 2005, it was hailed as an instant classic and often goes down as one of the greatest games ever made. With that reputation Resident Evil 5 has a lot to live up to. After four years in development, Resident Evil 5 is finally ready for its outing. There are some things to note, however, such as the idea that much of the horror is gone. So you probably won't be scared at any point while playing the game, but you will definitely be thrilled and you'll have a lot of fun.Resident Evil 5 sports a story which continues the conspiracy and most of it happens to be presented very well. The game is absolutely gorgeous looking in every way and runs consistently. The voice acting, for the most part, is pretty good. For many Resident Evil fans who can still remember the bad voice acting of the first one, it's nice to see just how far the series has come. Does Resident Evil 5's gameplay live up to its graphics and sound? Yes. The gameplay is perhaps the games strongest suit.A lot of the gameplay is similar to Resident Evil 4 in terms of its shooting mechanics. If you mastered the fourth installment, you'll be set to tackle what lies ahead here. The controls are easy to get acquainted with. You've got a large assortment of guns, even though you won't start with a good haul. Along those lines you've still got a trusty knife at your side that's a lot easier to use. As you gun down most of the evils that await you, you'll also notice that when they stumble you can approach them and a button prompt will pop up letting you perform special attacks. It helps if you want to conserve ammo.Conserving ammo might not be a problem, however. For what it's worth, there's quite a bit of it, not to mention some of your enemies might drop more. You'll be charged by hordes of bad guys all at once and have to take them on. Those who struggled with Resident Evil 4 might be surprised to find that the difficulty in fifth installment has been toned down considerably. You can absorb a bit more damage than you could before, and healing items restore are also a lot more plentiful along with ammo. This doesn't mean the game is entirely easier, just a bit more inviting.What's new for everyone, however, is the co-op mode and having a partner by your side. Playing co-op is a very fun, very exhilarating experience. No matter how you slice it the game is more fun with a friend. It can also be done online. It might seem gimmicky at first, but it all works out really well. There are moments where you'll be split up and have to send one partner somewhere while another provides cover fire, but for the most part, you'll be sticking together. It all comes together and works really well. You'll want to get a friend and play together whenever you can.If you feel like going at it alone, however, the AI will happily control the other character. In many games when the words AI"" and ""Partner"" come up it usually spells disaster... but this isn't so in Resident Evil 5. You'll control Chris in the single player experience, but Sheva will be alright in holding her own in many instances. She shoots and dodges enemies fairly well. In short, you shouldn't have to babysit her. This doesn't make the AI perfect. While she isn't useless in a fight you might notice that Sheva goes through ammo quite fast, sometimes even shooting enemies that aren't fully within reach. There's also not a whole lot of commands you give your partner either. You'll also find yourself having to organize her inventory. Constantly. It's not a bummer to play on single player, but some of it can feel like a chore.There are two things that might make gameplay take a little getting used to. The first is the menu system. It is now in real time. You only get nine spaces (eighteen, if you count your partner), and it never expands. Also, you can't move while the menu is open--despite it being in real time. This makes it hard to access healing items in the middle of a fight. However, Capcom has remedied this by having the directional pad be shortcut keys, which helps things along. One thing that might not seem as good is that you can't move while you shoot. Some argue if you could do this then Resident Evil 5 just wouldn't feel like Resident Evil. I can accept that, but some might not like the idea that in thirteen years Resident Evil still makes you stand perfectly still to raise your weapon. It's a minor complaint, however, as you'll rarely be so over taken that you should have to run and gun anyway. Besides that, the game is still easy despite this, it is obviously a design that Capcom intentionally left unchanged. You'll notice that while you can't move while you shoot, enemies are more than willing to slow down to give you a moment to aim. Nevertheless, there's an intensity to the gameplay that feels perfect. It's a lot of fun to play. You can't move while you shoot, but the lack of being able to do so never really presents itself as a problem. All this amounts to some pretty exciting gameplay. There's never a dull moment. And when the action slows down it's only a matter of time before it picks up again.If there was anything that truly might upset some fans, it would be that the horror element of the games is just about completely gone. You'll more than likely never be scared. There are a lot of thrilling moments, well designed enemies, bosses and level designs, but some might not like that Resident Evil 5 turns its back on horror almost entirely. You'll find some gruesome things, and plenty of blood and gore, but don't expect to be frightened by anything the game throws at you.Other than that, Resident Evil 5 is a solid game, in part because it's just amazingly fun to play. The fact that you can now go about it with a friend makes it much more exciting. It might not be scary, but at least it's still fun.""",5,A Remarkable Addition to a Great Series,2009/3/13 0:00
A2A0FBLKJN4ZY5,B000ZK6950,W. freeman,1,0,"First off does this feel like a RE game? Well the answer is yes and no. When you start out the game driving through the flat desert plains of Africa it feels more like Far Cry then RE, once you enter the small village look around and get right into the action it does have a nice atmosphere, but not the overall creep, and unerving one that we've all come to know and love. The first thing you'll notice about the game are the Gears of War type visauls via Chris Redfield and his bulging biceps and even the way he holds his gun and kicks open a door which btw they took directly from Gears. Your surroundings are untterly beautiful with this being some of the best graphics you'll see on any game this year. Now onto the gameplay. Well its the typical point and shoot, run and gun down the zombie gameplay you had with RE4 which in my opinion can never be touched. RE5 gameplay is much the same but a bit sloppier mainly because of your new partnet that follows you around like a little lost puppy. Don't get me wrong she comes in very"" handy in moments where your out numbered but can be a royal pain in the butt when it comes to making her pick up ammo, or making her get out of the way in certain tight areas. Also you'll notice there is a new stomp feature once the zombie hits the ground your given the option to kick it while its down, this obviously inspired by ""Dead Space"" but not nearly as affective seeing the the zombies head doesnt crush, he simply dies. Also there is a good touch of the game ""Dark Sector"" which in my opinion plays out a lot better control wise than RE5, when you play you'll just sense it. The new cover system is ""ok"" it does work but you very seldom ever really need it.Sound wise the game is pretty basic the locals scream in a foreign language, dogs howl with broke open faces, and demon reptiles screach at you from the skies, enemies are all unique and bosses seem old yet new. The dialogue is the usual cheesy cut scene RE hooply, and the story well is just basic and kind of cliche'. So with all this being said why do i give it a 4? Well this is the first RE game to grace a console in about 4 years or so and i've played RE4 to death so it does seem fresh and it is a lot of fun even if its not what i expected after many delays and controversy over the subject matter. By the way ive never read one article or seen one youtube video of ANYBODY claiming this game is racist. Matter of fact a young tall black boy stood behind me at gamestop at midnight for its release and we talked about the demo and how we thought it was ok and hoped the game was better, so hmm guess not everyone if anyone thinks the game is racist. So why this isnt going to be up for game of the year,(maybe sales wise) like i said its a nice new addition to the series even if it does lack that creepy, mansion, graveyard, dark forest material that we all wanted. So if you want by it, i think anyone will be taken in by the visuals alone and still get addicted to the great gameplay and staying alive that RE5 does have to offer. Dispite some of the bad RE5 does have some very ""tense"" moments and is worth of picking up a copy for various reasons.""",4,"Great Addition To The Series, But Lacking In Some Ways.",2009/3/21 0:00

I mean after all, Sigma on the Playstation 3 was frequently frustrating but it was one that you got better at over time. NGII on the other hand I played previously, found it borderline controller-throwing and figured no game is worth this frustration so why am I in the store buying it? It's really the combat system which is arguably, for me anyway, the funnest and most satisfying of the fighting styles, easily besting those in God of War, Devil May Cry, Heavenly Sword or even something like Prince of Persia games. But you know what? That doesn't excuse the poor cheap hits, odd bits of programming and large amount of enemies and this makes this a game that's incredibly hard to love.Story: There's a cutscene in the game where a werewolf named Volf (Volf the Wolf...lot of thought into that name, no?) declares to his minion werewolves that he wants an adversary worthy of him. That's all you need to know about this story: it's frequently stupid, doesn't make sense and is just a placeholder for the sexy violence. There's some kind of baddie who wants to revive a potentially world-destroying Archfiend and yeah, Ryu's the man to stop everybody's plans.Graphics: Team Ninja's animators do really great jobs at delivering not only fast combat but having it be as fluid as possible and seeing Ryu jump, dash and slice his way on screen is quite something to watch. Cutscenes look great and certain locales are quite stunning. However there is one thing they still haven't been able to perfect which is the skin on characters. Quite frankly, they look like shiny mannequins and even with Dead or Alive 4 released several years ago, they still haven't fixed this. Oh and we get it Team Ninja: you love bouncy breasts.Sound/Music: The music's quite dynamic, epic and nicely energetic though not memorable in terms of melodies but it provides an adequate soundtrack at your demon slaying parties while sound effects from roars to swishes of the blade(s) are very good at making the hits and kills that much sweeter. As for voice acting? Keep it on Japanese with English subtitles since the story and the VA becomes a hell of a lot more tolerable. I don't know why it is but even a flatly-delivered line in Japanese sounds cooler than English.Gameplay: Team Ninja are notoriously in love for difficult games; ones that challenge you and push you to the brink but at a certain point you got to ask yourself: is the game worth it if I'm madder at the game the more and more I play it? That's the crux and indeed the proverbial straw that might make you stop playing this. I find it funny on the back of the game's box is mentions that having the ability for save points to replenish your health or major battles will refill your health bar is helpful to a ""casual gamer"". Well you know what? Having played all Devil May Cry games, God of War as well as Ninja Gaiden Sigma, I honestly don't get how they think this game will be easy to Ninja Gaiden newbies or veterans since it frequently adds things detrimental to the enjoyment of it all. Enemies throw exploding shurikens with reckless abandon. Enemies with rocket launchers. Giant mechs in addition to enemies with rocket launchers. Then we have all 3 at once and yeah, this game can frequently get unfair. The game was even winning me over with parts that were challenging but not too bad but then boom, one annoyance after another.And all of this is further enhanced by one of the worst cameras you'll ever be in control of. This camera seems to love the scenery and you more than showing you what you're doing and very frequently I'd have to reposition the camera just to figure out what's going on or who hit me or where that enemy came from. I get that the kill animations wouldn't be as impressive if it was like God of War's camera being your eye-in-the-sky but at least then you could figure out what was going on in the battlefield. Like Tomb Raider games, you'd think with reviews and fans complaining of bad cameras, Team Ninja would go ""damn, we should fix that camera problem next game"" but apparently not. Game's so difficult even the game does stuff that'll make it easier to kill you faster.Now the game as I mentioned way above has probably the most visceral and all-around entertaining fighting combat systems around. Sure it's really just LT to block, X for weak, Y for strong like most games but honestly; being able to go all over the screen tearing enemies apart limb by limb has never felt as rewarding as this. Like I said, save points can regenerate you to full health while major battles can heal you fully after they're done (provided you don't have any red sections) and the wealth of weapons make it apparently easy to make it through the game. Also thankfully, Team Ninja toned down the precision-based platforming sections as well as those damned ghost fish though in their place are respawning jelly fish that explode,  a boss that explodes and kills you unless you hold block (chapter 7, so I save you the aggravation of replaying him) and an item limit of 3....3! You can only carry 3 of each item and yeah, fun fighting, annoying game design.I wish Team Ninja didn't make such frustrating and difficult games since they'd make some of the best action games around but alas, if you're going to get into this, make sure you're not the controlling-throwing kind.""",3,3.5; it ain't easy being a ninja,2009/4/20 0:00
A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000ZK696O,"Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...""",8,6,"The successor to the Ninja Gaiden game for the Xbox, Ninja Gaiden 2 is one of those rare sequels that seems to improve on everything done by the first game while adding worthwhile new features, enemies, and levels.The basic gameplay is the same as the first Ninja Gaiden game, featuring fast-and-frantic swordplay and various ninja abilities to supplement it. You play as Ryu Hayabusa, last ninja of the Dragon Clan lineage, and your mission is to seal the ancient Arch-Fiends away before they destroy the world. The action is almost non-stop in NG2; Ryu has a wide array of acrobatic actions at his disposal to aid in his swordplay. There are fast and slow attacks that can be linked as a combo for different effects, and there's a lot of leaping and diving to throw into the mix as well. In addition to melee weapons like a sword, a staff, claws, and a scythe, Ryu also has a few ranged weapons as well - shurikens (regular and exploding) and a bow. Finally, Ryu has certain magical abilities like fireballs and cutting winds to attack his enemies with, though their use is limited. His enemies range from ninjas - armed with equipment similar to Ryu's - to demons, large and small.The gameplay is smooth, but fast and unforgiving. Your enemies attack ferociously and without mercy - no fair-play one on one"" duels here, your enemies will be doing their absolute utmost to make Ryu die. Human enemies (the ninja) have a wide variety of ""abilities"", for lack of a better word, that differentiate them from other random grunts in other games. The ninjas in Ninja Gaiden can lose limbs (arms or legs) and keep fighting - and this will happen a lot, be assured. Heavily injured enemies will try to grab on to Ryu and detonate their bomb as a last-ditch suicide attempt. Ninja types range from melee combatants with swords and claws to ranged types with bows and magic spells. Even without these skills, it's hard to keep up with their attacks, which require dodging, guarding, evading, and counterattacking to deal with - you can't just wade in and mash the attack buttons and expect to survive. The demons are even harder, being less predictable, depending on their type. Some are small, bat-like creatures that swarm Ryu faster than he can swing his sword, while others are hulking colossi that can grab Ryu and squeeze the life out of his body. There are bosses on every level as well - these enemies are generally much larger than any regular enemy, and their strength makes guarding useless, forcing Ryu to jump and dive for his life. Furthermore, they're not fazed by your attacks, requiring you to time your attacks so that you'll have time to escape before they counterattack. Overall, Ninja Gaiden is a relatively simple game in that it keeps the same basic premise for combat; there aren't really any segments that deviate from the established gameplay.As a whole, the controls are good and also notably responsive. In some other games, you have to adjust your timing to the game and pause between pressing buttons so that the moves you've inputted can be executed. In NG2, the game moves roughly about as fast as you push buttons - if you're smashing the buttons really quickly, then the moves will get executed really quickly. To give an example, Ryu has the ability to walljump between two adjacent parallel walls. At first I thought I had to adjust my timing to wait for when he landed; I quickly realized that I could just mash the A button and ascend as quickly as I tapped. The game really rewards you for having good reflexes, and tries not to hinder you as best it can. The only really annoying parts about the controls are the camera (which is kind of unresponsive at times) and sensitivity with regards to hanging on pipes and running on walls, both of which have to do with the camera (since running on a wall is ""running forward"", if the camera changes it can mess you up mid-run).The graphics in the game are really good looking, though ""realistic"" isn't quite the word that I'd use to describe them. They're clearly fake, but it's on purpose, so even though the characters have flawless, one-tone skin with no wrinkles or anything, it looks good and like it was done on purpose. The in-game graphics are really good, too. Combat is quick and highly cinematic without distracting or detracting from the gameplay experience. The most notable detail is the bodies, which are persistent - kill a bunch of ninjas, and their bodies don't fade (not while onscreen, at least). Furthermore, I never thought I'd think of blood and severed limbs as being ""artistic"", but this game really has the prettiest blood sprays and dead bodies that I can think of. Blood splatters on walls depending on the angle that you cut, and you really get the feeling with this game that you're an absolute ninja murder-machine. One of the more impressive details is the blood that accumulates on your blade - when a fight is over and Ryu stands idle for a few seconds, he whips the blood off the blade (throwing an extra splatter onto the floor) and re-sheathes it.The sound in the game isn't particularly notable, except that the sounds of combat are really well shown - the clangs and screams, in addition with the music, create a mood-setting level of background noises that keep you in the action. The music in general doesn't have any tracks that are particularly good, though.As a whole, Ninja Gaiden 2 is a really fun game to play - one of the first games in a while that really feels like a game and not just an interactive story. Flimsy demon-based story aside, Ninja Gaiden 2 is really just an excuse to kill a bunch of ninjas and demons with fancy moves and look really awesome while doing it. The only real problem is that the game is so hard that it might be intimidating to casual players, but for players with good reflexes and a strong will Ninja Gaiden 2 offers nothing but good, fun gameplay.9/10""",5,Fun Fast Furious,2008/10/21 0:00

Durham Big Evil""""",20,11,"The title Ninja Gaiden alone will coax enough praise and groan-worthy comments from anyone who has had experience with Tecmo's long running series, and Ninja Gaiden II is no different.  Once again, a Ninja Gaiden game has managed to provide heaping amounts of action-oriented gameplay that can become mind-numbingly difficult, and once again, for those that enjoy the series' gameplay, the game delivers in spades, and is a spectacular action experience.  Once again playing as Ryu Hyabusa, you take on hordes of enemies that can be dispatched in some outrageously bloody and violent ways.  The character models and action set-pieces are so flashy and well designed that there will be moments of trying to pick your jaw up off the floor.  Yes, the game looks that good.  The only drawback from a graphical standpoint is that some of the environments themselves aren't all that worth noting, but with so much frentic action, you'll rarely notice.  Being a Ninja Gaiden game, there are spectacular boss battles to engage in as well, and the other enemies in general provide much challenge to boot.  The only major flaw with Ninja Gaiden II would have to be the in-game camera, which at times can make the game even more infuriating to play.  If this can be forgiven however, you will find some tough and rewarding gameplay that the series is known for; and the game's wonderful control, wild story, superb cut-scenes, great new weapons, and grisly finishing moves make this an even sweeter package.  All in all, Ninja Gaiden II is a spectacular action game that nearly perfectly follows the same winning formula that the series has in the past, and is an essential pick up for XBox 360 owners that love the series, and a more than worthwhile introduction for new fans of the series as well.",5,Spectacular,2008/6/4 0:00

I wanted to very badly, but no matter how much I tried I failed in the end. Thankfully NG2 is a bit more forgiving on the easy setting, but new comers will never make it past the first level. The game's story is nothing special and feels like a rehash at best. You have to save the world from the Arch Fiends taking over the world and destroying so you have to hunt them down one by one. The game play is essentially the same as NG1. You have light and heavy attacks along with projectile weapons that you can charge. The game has many more weapons and Ninpo scrolls to use. Weapons range from scythes, tonfas, flails, and even staffs. All the weapons are great and you can upgrade them for up to three levels and after the enemies get too strong for that weapon you'll never use it again.The Ninpo magic is useful for enemies, but useless on bosses since it doesn't do any damage. The can be used to cripple enemies and finish them off with a finishing move. There are a lot of new moves in the game yet they are repeated far too often. You can hack enemies apart into a bunch of pieces and continue to hack them up for overkill bonuses. While you rack up your Karma score you can also buy items from the Masamusa shops which are generously spread throughout the levels and the same goes for save points. I never found the game unfair with checkpoints or saves. Once you die at a boss you start right there in front of the boss again so this makes things less frustrating. Another cool element is being able to run on top of water. You can fight enemies this way as well and just adds to the awesome ninja feel to the game. I also found the controls less responsive than the first game and also a bit sluggish. You'll try to hit an enemy, but they'll back away and hit you but you're stuck in an animation that you can't back out of. This isn't a huge issue but it's still there. Another problem is the camera which is terrible. Instead of following Ryu it'll always stay in one spot so enemies are coming at you blindly. While this also isn't a huge issue it doesn't make things better.Throughout each level is a Test of Valor portal which has you killing as many enemies in the room as you can and rewarding you. These get extremely hard then super easy. The game also looks amazing. While it's not Assassin's Creed or Gears of War amazing it looks astounding with awesome lighting, high res textures, realistic physics and what have you. Another problem is that the game is insanely linear with literally only one straight path to go on. this makes fighting a bit cramped sometimes, but overall isn't a huge issue. A lot of people will have the biggest problem with the difficulty. While it's tolerable on easy you'll never beat normal or, god forbid, hard.What makes the game so hard are the limited healing items, some cheap enemies, and the sluggish controls. You never really feel powerful enough no matter what weapons you get. I really hated this and is the most disappointing part of the game. There are also times where the frame rate will chug when there are tons of enemies on-screen. This makes those sections even more annoying.The game has lots of gore, sexy women, cool weapons and magic, a long campaign, leaderboards, amazing visuals, but it falls down some with sluggish controls, a bad camera and insane difficulty. If you loved NG1 you're going to have a blast here, but if the first game made you feel standoffish then pick NG2 up because you'll be able to at least beat the game.",4,"This is where the troubled series starts it's decent, but this one is good",2012/3/28 0:00

A1TY4TRLA4QK5Y,B000ZK7ZOE,"Brian Long Brian""""",11,6,"Infamous follows Cole, a bike messenger suddenly gifted with the ability to manipulate bioelectric fields, courtesy of what looks like a low yield nuclear explosion(the opening sequence for this game, at least when you first turn it on, is very well done and drops you right in). The Blast and everything which follows is based around a shadowy group and the standard trio of gangs that take over in the chaotic aftermath.Gameplay manages to be unbelievably entertaining, with little repetition, apart from random enemy encounters, though every fight racks up experience to unlock new powers. The powers themselves all manage to be useful, and theres no one power that you'll use all the time because its the magical power of kill-everything-now, apart from the normal blast, and none of the powers are overly broken. Despite your abilities, and even with the highest level of damage reduction, the regular peons still can be threatening, and if you let yourself get overly confident, you could quickly find yourself shot full of lead.The morale system manages to be grey enough that certain evil decisions are less evil than just self serving, or better yet, let one suffer so I can help more. Apart from just randomly slaughtering civilians though, every decision does carry enough of a morale quandary to not be the power an orphanage vs. burn it to the ground"" decisions that plague other games. I'm looking at you, KOTOR 3.Graphics are phenomenal, though clipping does pose problems at times, but the few bugs can work to advantage, as theres nothing that brings a smile like seeing a bad guy spin up, up, and away after being hit with an explosive shockwave. The buildings and high rises all look near photorealistic at even short distances. The lightning effect never loses its charm, and aside from the problem of too many explosions whiting out the screen, the effects have yet to disappoint. Probably one of the better visual effects is being wounded. Blood will splatter your HUD, and eventually your vision will begin to gray out, to the point that almost everything become indistinguishable grayish lumps.Audio and voicing is also top notch, with entertaining characters, clear, crisp dialogue even at distance, and characters that actually feel realistic.The difficulty is well balanced, though certain missions, namely rooftop races, are annoying trial and error mini-games, and several other standard missions are little more than grind sandwiches. But still, above all, massive props for having more than 3 generic rinse and reuse missions.All told, aside from some annoying missions and enemies sometimes being clumped in battalion strength, this game is quickly rising to my top 5. Some of the story was revealed way too early(you'll know near everything about your powers and the Blast by mission 5), and there are some wtf missions, but otherwise, this game is engaging, well made, fun, and relatively bug free. Even many of the standard ""I only hate X about these kinds of games"" have been addressed. Fr instance, saving is segmented, so you won't start at the beginning of a 45 minute story mission, if you stumble with the controller and plunge into the lake. The finding missions all appear on your HUD, rather than being scouting nightmares, forcing you to scour every roof in the game looking for shards to up your health. This is one of the rare pieces that's easily worth full market price, as it'll encourage more of the same. I'm just incredibly pissed that its ps3 exclusive.""",5,Near gaming nirvana,2009/5/26 0:00

Brought to you by the development team who did the ""Sly Cooper"" series on the Playstation 2, here was this PS3 exclusive game coming out yet I wasn't like ""oh my god I have definately got to get this game"" but felt more like ""well looks like fun, probably rent it when it comes out"". This is the part where I'd eat my words if I only had naysayed the game because this thing is fun and strangely addicting since I'd often find myself playing for extended periods of time and sure it's got a couple of issues but it's one of the top games released so far this year and I even find it funner than ""Killzone 2"".Story: You play as Cole McGrath who after delivering a package which subsequently blows up, near destroying Liberty City and branded a ""terrorist"" by the city people, Cole finds himself gifted/cursed with the ability to control and harness lightning and electricity. The city contained to keep in the Reavers, infected people terrorizing the populace, Cole strikes a deal with an agent named Moya: find her husband John and find out about something called the ""Ray Sphere"" and he'll allow her to leave. But Cole has another thing to find out: who gave him the package, why did he have it and the voice he hears occasionally.Graphics: Graphically Infamous looks nice though you're probably not gonna go ""wow"" a lot. In a way the graphic style is more pleasant to look at and looks really great but in terms of POP, the game doesn't have that wow factor you might get with Killzone 2 or Metal Gear Solid 4 or even the other open world sandbow game, Grand Theft Auto IV. I did notice a couple of glitches such as jittery civilians where they seemingly get stuck, I actually fell through the streets and died once but I barely noticed any drops in framerate and slowdown, especially one mission involving a bus and...let's just say you can spam attacks and graphically? Awesome. Having cutscenes be comic book style? Excellent.Sound/Music: Music-wise I didn't notice a whole lot special though it's by no means forgettable but music in games is usually meant to enhance the game whereas I felt it drifted in the background. Big action shootouts are frenetic but not intense which the music should've done. Voice acting though is quite good with Cole having the standard gruff cig-smoker voice while the other actors are quite well characterized. The city populace is nice as well and the constant complaints about your stink (probably because you can't shower thanks to your powers) can get funny though it's like ""Yes I know I stink, shut up"".Gameplay: ""Infamous"" gameplay combines the open-world of Crackdown and Grand Theft Auto with upgradeable abilities which ties into Cole's gifts with electricity. He starts out with your standard electrobolt which is basically like your ammo until you unlock stuff like shockwave which acts as a ""pusher"", a electro-grenade which you can stick to people Halo-style, and your main mode of transport, grinding where you can surf the train rails or power lines. Upgrading your abilities is pretty fun since you can unlock some actual useful upgrades as opposed to just ""this but tougher"" and XP is actually pretty frequent and though they're usually just 10-15 for enemy takedowns and maybe 3 for dealing with fallen enemies and civilians. Also since you can be evil or good, the abilities can change how the powers actually work. My one complaint is how you get them as there is a clear formula: go down a manhole, charge a station, get your power and make it through a really dark sewer with your new gifts but all and all, using electricity is super fun.One complaint that I will address is the enemies and I will say this: you will die...frequently. While the checkpoint system is incredibly forgiving, the enemy aim is exceptionally skilled even at long distances, you have to contend with missile launching buggers, turrets, turrets on top of trucks and more than once I died from at least 8-10 and some sections even more. The game's not Ninja Gaiden difficult where you feel like giving up or call the game unfair but more than once it's like ""oh come on, give me at least a little chance"". Another thing the game includes is a good/evil mechanic where the more good you are, the more celebrity and popular the city sees you, putting up posters and even helping out during shootouts and taking pictures. But if you're evil, they'll boo and even throw stuff at you but when you can cause as much mayhem as you want, just fry the buggers. Only problem is that there's no grey area where you really have to think about your choices it's either: save these people and not take their goodies or kill everybody and take it all.Some of the side missions are slightly repetitive where they range from fun to extremely tedious and/or frustrating but the story is intriguing and really well-told.

Five minutes into your first play you'll notice that they are similar, half an hour in and you'll notice that they have quite a lot in common, an hour in and you'll wonder how no one sued for plagiarism.While Prototype was set in a gloomy Manhattan Island and was very bloody and gory, inFamous takes place on the fictional Islands of Empire City and is a fairly bloodless game as most bad guys are killed with electric shocks. There's also no swearing, which makes it a safer option for discriminate parents.You play as Cole MacGrath, a bicycle messenger who is caught in the middle of a devastating blast which obliterates a chunk of the city. When he wakes he discovers that he has new electric powers and that the media is trying to pin the blame of the blast on him. It's up to the player to decide whether to use these new powers for good or evil (the Platinum trophy is dependent on both, requiring 2 play-throughs). The missions are based on restoring power to the islands and clearing out the feral gangs which have formed in the blackout. It gets a little bit repetitive but the most aggravating thing about the gameplay is the fact that Cole is constantly trying to grab ledges and surfaces as you attempt to free-run your way through the city. It makes smooth navigation very hard and can be a real pain during time-dependent missions. Also some of Cole's upgraded abilities are just too high-powered, meaning he'll blow himself up if you're fighting in close-quarters.Despite these complaints, it's a fairly easy-going game and one which you can play superficially without ever getting really involved. The comic-book cutscenes are very nice to look at, though the music is rather forgettable.The pros and cons when compared to Prototype are more or less even.

Almost everything that Spiderman or Batman can do, with none of the main villains. Speaking of main villains, the game doesn't really have one. Sure people go around mentioning 'her' but she's never really seen. She's not like an antagonist or anything.The controls in the game are good. You can wall climb, hang off things, jump, aim and fire. Your powers seem infinite and you get more as you play through the game using experience points that you get from beating bad guys and helping people. There are plenty of enemies. In fact they're usually at rooftops shooting at you, which makes running out in the open really dangerous. So your best bet to stay alive is to climb to the top of buildings like Nathan Drake or Spiderman. I hear that the protagonist Cole is a messenger, but no messenger really wall crawls like he does. Plus they never really say he's a messenger in the game yet I hear developers talking about it. He also wears a backpack yet never uses it. Just seems like a waste.The real downside is the open city exploration feels more like a single player MMO. You walk around to markers that are people who give quests and then you do a quest. At the end of it all, it just feels so random and inconsequential. Why did I just do that mission? To make another section of the city safe so people aren't shooting at me from rooftops? So that makes the game easier as time goes on when it should get more challenging.... So as you get bigger and better powers there are less enemies to use them on.Oh and there's not much in the enemy variety. Pretty much gang members that all have the same exact look... suicide bombing gang members... guys working turrets on the back of trucks and some sort of strange ghosts. The enemy AI is good. They'll run away and be deadly accurate with a machine gun from half a mile away. Not that I'm complaining... if you take enough damage the screen turns grey and you run away and hide for a moment and poof, your health has been restored. I would have really loved to see more variety or even different gangs. Yep 1 single gang has control of an entire city and even though the cops have guns they don't have shootouts with them. No other citizen has a gun either. They just take pictures of you as you walk by and cheer your name when you do good. Some pedestrians will flag you down to tell you things like to restore a near dead person back to life. Yep some street walker drank poison or was shot to death but Super Cole can cure them with electricity like a defibrillator.The main voice actors get on my nerves. The hero / anti hero has a gravely voice that seems out of place and his sidekick has a thick accent that seems completely out of place as well.

You never really feel any sort of constraints as to where you can go and what you can do, playing like a hybrid of Grand Theft Auto and Spider-Man 2.  Not to mention that the city is vast and detailed, and navigating it is easy as well.  The comic book-style touches throughout Infamous only help make the game's story all the more engrossing, and the moral choices to make as to whether to help or crush the people only add to the game's tone.  If there's any notable drawbacks to Infamous, it's that the game isn't without its share of visual glitches.  Though the game looks good and is fluidly animated, there are some noticable graphical hiccups that occur.  Not to mention that there is a certain degree of repetivity in the game's missions, but this doesn't stop Infamous from being one of the absolute most fun games available on the PS3.  All in all, Infamous is definitely one of the best games to find on the PS3 right now, and if this does indeed form a new franchise for Sony to push, here's hoping that the best is yet to come.",5,A masterpiece,2009/5/30 0:00

The one annoyance I do have have is the characters jump ability depth,  what I mean is there are times where you're jumping from building to building or pipe to pipe or something and while at first it looks like your jumping the same distance you did from the earlier platform but to your surprise(And sometimes annoyance) you fall to your death or get hurt and you're wondering why you didn't make the jump when it was the same distance you did with two previous platforms before.  That aside the rest of the game is fantastic as are the characters of the game Cole the main hero/villain of the game with fantastic lightning abilities that you can upgrade throughout the game as you complete the main game storyline as well as miniquests that are all throughout the city,  Zeke Coles's best friends and seems like a wannabe Elvis lookalike and finally Trish Cole's girlfriend who loves him deeply but is conflicted with her emotions as well as she feels he is the one responsible for the death of someone close to her.  The game also has a Star wars force unleashed part as well meaning you make moral choices throughout the game,  you can either be a good guy helping the citizens of the city and the like or be more self serving and vindictive killing people who get in your way if they cause you to much trouble or if it's fortuitous to use them maliciously.

A2A0FBLKJN4ZY5,B000ZK9QCS,W. freeman,2,1,"I played a little of the first 2 GOWs a few years back but it really didn't phase me much perhaps because when i played i was enjoying more graphically enhanced games, like Gears, Bioshock, and Call Of Duty 4. So, i waited to pick up 3 knowing the graphics would be superb and make for a much more well rounded experience overall. The game is extremely graphic, but nothing that most of us haven't seen before, also your not really killing TO many people, mostly creatures, so its all good! I can't stress enough how great the graphics are and how much it feels like you are in an absolute movie and its an amazing feeling to experience. Playing through it on Hard took around 10 hours, wasn't really what i would call hard, you really just have to have quick fingers, and focus on what your doing. I love all the giant rock creatures and i think the coolest looking boss to fight(the whole scene) was Possiden. All the flying, and cut scenes really keep you enthralled even if the gameplay is pretty basic and at certain times tells you to hit, 0, X, R1 etc. I also loved Dante's Inferno, its not quite as intense as this as far as story and excitement, but its really foul and a lot more vile, actually disgusting at times. So get both games together, this one definitely rules the roost and is the original brutal thrash and kill series. Also both games touch on different issues, Dante touches on hell and the seven deadly sins, while GOW goes for a gory mythological message and does it very well. I don't give many games 5 stars and this one is no exception, i'm just strict that way, it really has to WOW me, as did Resident Evil 4 and really be something i can just get totally lost in. GOW 3 is close, but i want more of an engrossing story, and puzzles to figure out. Not much of that exists in this game, but then again thats not the type of game it is. The controls are very very good and responsive as is the FPS, i don't think i've ever seen a better looking stable, no lag game on any system to date, sorry Killzone 2 its gotcha beat. So i may go through it a second time, i'm finishing up Dante right now, no nightmares of bloody demons and guts yet, suprisingly!! Dante seems a bit longer, or in some ways just more tedious, and difficult, its not as well thought out as GOW 3 but has its great moments. I'm not really comparing the two even though they are alike, i just really am glad to see PLATFORMING games making a BIG comeback, more more this year i hope, love it. Really looking forward to Lost Planet 2(doesnt seem to be getting hype), and also the New Castelvania in October the first on a next GEN SYSTEM! So it seems to be a good year for games like this, and i hope first person shooters take a back seat for a while, because i have become way burnt out on them. Also whats up with Xbox and NO exclusives? Mass Effect 2, come on. I love my Xbox as well but they need something fresh, i hope Alan Wake does the Trick. So pick up GOW 3 its worth the money just for graphics alone, but you will love ripping off the heads, and disemboweling giant creatures for fun, it does ROCK!",4,"Great fun for Hack and Slash, Very movie like also",2010/3/21 0:00
A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B000ZK9QCS,Winter,2,1,"The original God of War was quite an amazing game for its time, and its sequel proved that the series' success was not just a flash in the pan.  God of War II brought more of everything to the table, from gameplay to graphics.  Since God of War III represents the series' first entry into the PS3, a simple graphics upgrade would have been enough to set it apart from its predecessors...but the game designers were far from content to do just that.The God of War games are third-person and action-based.  In all of them you play Kratos, a mortal who made a deal with the gods, it all fell apart, and now he's out for bloody revenge.  You use various weapons and items to accomplish your goal, and as you go through the game you can choose which items to level up"" and make more powerful.  Just like God of War II, God of War III has more of everything.  Graphics are stunning.  The scale of massive, realistic environments and architecture is breathtaking.  Gameplay is improved and there are new weapons, techniques, and ways to balance your upgrades as you earn 'skill points' (power orbs).  This game was programmed from end to end for the PS3's hardware:  it has rich lighting, intricate textures, massive open levels, plenty of physics effects, and in case that wasn't enough, the developers have added the ability to tear apart and disembowel your opponents in the most hideously gory ways I have ever seen.  There are effects here that would make the Lord of the Rings movies seem dull and simple, and there is violence and gore to make Tarantino blush.  The grandeur of God of War III shows us that a movie might be a step down for Kratos.The storyline of God of War follows the same pattern as its predecessors:  Kratos lost everything, Kratos wants revenge, Kratos has to climb up the celestial ladder to get to the top.  Lest you think this leaves the battles as simplistic as the earlier titles, rest assured that on Normal difficulty, some battles can be a nightmare, and took me MANY tries to get through.There's one huge obstacle with a sequel like this one:  you earned a ton of amazing skills and powers in the last game--enough to kill a God of Olympus.  How could you start off the new title with all of that stuff and still be challenged?  God of War II handled this by taking away all of your powers, and I was worried that I'd be blown completely back to square one.  Instead, God of War III handles it well:  you lose a lot of your abilities, but still keep some of the most useful ones (for example, Icarus Wings).  As you progress through the game you will receive items that change the way you play (such as a bow & arrow or magic boots).  Suddenly, using your head and being creative get rewarded.  Without giving away too much:  there are parts of the game where the environment changes significantly, and moving around in it gets infinitely more interesting.  For example, you earn ways to find hidden goodies and you earn the ability to run along walls or move incredibly fast.All isn't perfect with God of War III.  If you pause the game, you may see a 2-3 second ""freeze"" before unpausing resumes.  I've seen Kratos do finishing moves in the middle of the air on an invisible enemy because his opponent died a few seconds ago.  These are fairly harmless.  Most frustrating is some inconsistency:  you're supposed to jump off a ledge, but you can only do so at one particular spot.  Or you're walking along a protected edge when you fall off for no apparent reason.  There's also a 'musical puzzle' a la Guitar Hero that was difficult to use and didn't really add anything to the game.  That said, if you were pleased with the other God of War titles, you will very much enjoy God of War III.  If you're new to the series, you couldn't have picked a more stunning place to start.BONUS TIP:  When you defeat Hades and swim the river Styx, don't go downstream right away.  Go upstream as far as you can, dive down to the bottom, and you will find a secret item that becomes unlocked when you beat the game.  Enjoy!""",5,"Shock and Awe, Spartan-Style...",2010/8/2 0:00
A1TY4TRLA4QK5Y,B000ZK9QD2,"Brian Long Brian""""",8,5,"I thoguht it was rather ironic that the game includes a achievement title Seriously 2.0"" That seems to be the mantra of the game. Its Gears of War with better graphics, a few new weapons, and a few new enemies. This is by no means to say the game is bad, but I'll save my nits for the moment.GoW 2 follows everyones favorite smoking-since-childhood Sergeant Fenix. The COG has decided to go on the offensive, having been backed into the one remaining habitable city of the world. Fenix and his squad are sent on an attack against a nearby settlement, drilling down into the caverns of the Locust to take the fight to them.The new level designs are pretty, and have the look of actual underground caverns rather than dark, dank sewers like most shooters. Theres local plant life and animal life that doesn't try and eat your face, which is a nice deviation from the norm. Theres an appearance by a weird Darth Maul esque Locust, and a new species of Imulsion eating creature that also fight the Locust, as well as a few new characters which are shuffled around with a little to much speed.The problem, and really the only problem, is that this is by and large Gears of War version 2.0, or better yet, Gears of War Episode 2. Theres not enough new material to justify the full price. Sure theres some new toys and skins, and the storyline is gripping, it has plot holes you can drive a 20-meter wide worm through, and WTF moments abound during some of the explanation, but otherwise, the game is a rehash of encounter by encounter fights we all know and love. Again, this is not to say the game isn't fun, it is, but its all more of the same. Theres no new sequences like we've gotten from Half-Life, no interesting new game mechanic to change it up any, and while the levels are pretty, some have a problem with flow, and theres that nagging feeling of repetition.All told, it plays good and it looks good, but has a faint overarching taste of bland and uninspired. I didn't go into this expecting revolution, and there wasn't any, but there was a genuinely fun game that can kill quite a few hours, but the difficulties been ramped down and the story is starting to grind. While being kept in the dark is a good way to stretch out a good plot and keep players interested, keeping the player totally blind gives a feeling of annoyed helplessness, rather than the overwhelmed feeling they were able to create in the first installment.""",3,Gears of War v2.0,2008/11/10 0:00
A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000ZK9QD2,"Cloud ...""""",4,2,"It's strange looking back at Gears of War 2"" since it was the game that made me decide ""ok that does it, time to buy an Xbox 360"". Hard to tell why since I had a perfectly good Playstation 3 working and with good exclusives but like most people, the other team has cool stuff too. Playing it endlessly at the time of its release, I find it graphically stunning, fun to play and Horde mode was a bit addicting. But time has a habit of lessening the impact and while I still say Gears of War 2 is an extremely well-executed game, some aspects of it bug the **** out of me.Story: Taking place several months after the end of the original, citizens have been reported being sick by something called Rustlung disease thanks to the Lightmass bomb detonation. To make matters worse, entire cities have been sinking into the ground and the last city stronghold Jacinto is next and so Marcus Fenix and friend Dom Santiago decide to take the fight to the Locust stronghold and hopefully find Dom's missing wife, Maria.The problem ultimately with the story is 2 things: one concerns Cliff Bleszinki's claim that the story is more personal. And while there's an actual reason for Dom in this one, too often does it feel like they skimped on the extra elements that would've made the story work. Okay the character Maria, who we have to save and who Dom keeps obsessing about finding, is introduced in one flashback scene and only mainly seen in a photograph. Would've been nice to at least get some extra development on her character considering she's one of the key figures in the story. Secondly is Epic's love for setpieces or namely outdoing their last one. Yes sequels always have a ""bigger, badder, better"" mentality but what made the original work is the bigger gunfights mixed in with more quieter and different chapters. Recall the Kryll section from the first one. Here it feels like you're just constantly shooting ****.Graphics: Yes Gears of War 2 is definately one of the more superb looking games on the Xbox 360. The lighting, the detail on character's faces, the more improved architecture and changes in fight encounters make this more advanced than the original, which is pretty amazing still. However, as most people have complained, there's an extremely noticeable ""same-y"" feeling to it, what with the greys and browns. Multiplayer doesn't have the same level of detail though that's a given and lag can hit so watch out.Sound/Music: There's 2 different things to look at in regards to voice acting: the acting and the scripts since its what the actors have to actually say. Some actors can deliver awful lines with gusto and that's a case here since a lot of these lines are just...bad and not a whole lot of character development either but at least the actors do a good job with the lines themselves. The music is big, epic and frequently engaging,making the bigger firefights that much more awesome. Although I am getting tired of the theme that plays during matchmaking though.Gameplay: Same thing as before since the game isn't like Call of Duty or Halo where you can just run and shoot; this time you have to find cover, pop off some rounds and get back down. It's not as magnetic as it was in the first one where you'd attach to walls you didn't want to and they're quite easy to pick up on. Weapon selection is mapped to D-Pad with default Lancer being right, left being shotgun/bow/sniper rifle etc, up's your grenades, down's your pistols. Aside from the wonky d-pad making you pick a pistol when you wanted the shotgun, it's a lot more faster and immediate than having to scroll through your lists a la Half-Life 2 let's say.Co-op of course is here but this time there's a special feature: individual difficulties. Say you beat the game and want to beat it on Insane with a buddy (seeing as how the AI is still pathetic). Well rather than tackling insane on both sides, one guy can be on Casual, other's on Insane and just let Casual do all the work up front while Insane snipes from the back. It makes getting that achievement easier but I hate going through single player since the AI on your friends are a little...screwed. One thing: the Friends with Benefits achievement unlocks if the entire game is in co-op, so if for one second somebody logs out, it messes up the achievement and you have to find a friend and pick chapter start. Worse thing is that it actually doesn't tell you WHAT chapters you're missing so it becomes a dart throwing game on a map where you randomly pick an act and hope your missing chapter's in there.The big draw and the one reason people will repeatedly play Gears of War 2 is the multiplayer. There's quite a few modes from a Capture the Flag variant where the flag is a gun-toting brat who doesn't want to be captured, King of the Hill with hills frequently changing location, Wingman where you and a buddy take on 4 2-player teams and the ever-popular Horde mode. You and 4 others take on 50 waves of locusts that get stronger after every 10. While it's very fun (though slightly boring if you've beaten all 50), would've liked to see variances in the waves since they just repeat the next time and a surprise round would've been nice.However I will say that after 3 title updates, there's still a lot of kinks to get ironed out and it's strange how the talented guys at Epic still can't seem to get this one right. Weapon damage is inconsistent (guy survives 3 shotgun blasts to the face at point-blank range, he gets one shot 10 feet away and poof!), lag can be frequent, matchmaking can be long and disconnects can result in loss of EXP. Why can't it be like Call of Duty where individual actions bring EXP and not disconnects or Halo where EXP only comes from winning the match. People play to win not find all their hard work vanishing because you had the one bad connection match. So of course naturally most of the achievements are in multiplayer. How lovely.Gears of War 2 is one of the most successful games of 2008 but it's still not a flawless experience but that doesn't stop people from flocking to it in droves. Give it a play though I find other games have been eating up my time lately.""",5,The bumpy road to sequel-ville,2008/11/24 0:00

A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000ZK9QD2,"Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...""",2,2,"The prototypical third-person cover shooter, Gears of War 2"" is a solid rush of now-standard gameplay conventions and action movie dialogue. It has its charms, and is a pretty solid game, but isn't without its problems.GoW2 operates under the same basic principles as the first game: you play as a bulky space marine, using cover-shooter mechanics to carve through waves of enemy monsters. Most shooting is either done ""blind"" (shooting from behind cover) or popping out and shooting. Like in the first game, there are a few things that separate it from other cover shooters. The first of these is the ""active reload"" system, where timing your reload properly allows you to do it faster or even improve the damage of your next magazine. The second is melee combat, most famously the ""chainsaw bayonets"" mounted on the standard assault rifle. However, for the most part GoW2's combat is formulaic, like the first.There are a few new weapons to spice things up, though. These include a gatling gun (that must be mounted on cover and cranked to fire) and a mortar launcher (good at distances, but less so at close range). The action is intense and fast-paced, but the main issue is that even with varying weapons, you're still basically doing the same cover routine over and over and over. There are a few sequences to break up the monotony, but they don't disguise the fact that the main game is kind of simplistic.Multiplayer is one of the game's strongest points. There are basically three kinds: cooperative, competitive, and horde mode. Cooperative refers to the ability to play through the campaign with multiple players. It's simplistic, but fun. Competitive refers to the standard set of multiplayer modes - deathmatch, capture-the-flag, etc. Horde mode is an expansion of cooperative mode that allows up to five players to try to survive against waves of enemies. It's probably the most interesting mode, and allows for the most strategic options (figuring out where to hole up, setting traps and killzones, etc).The game's production values are good. It's visually exciting, if a bit repetitive. The guns sound neat, and there's certainly nothing more ominous than the revving of the aforementioned chainsaw-bayonets. Gears of War 2 is most fun as a multiplayer game - it's the kind of game where you can get some friends together and play all afternoon. As mentioned, it gets kind of repetitive, but the multiplayer experience is enough to overcome that.Rating: 8/10.We purchased this game with our own funds from a game store.""",4,"sold game, some problems",2010/10/6 0:00

Now we finally have Gears of War 2, a game that while not as jaw-dropping and awe-inspiring as the original, still manages to improve on many aspects of the original, while at the same time providing the same spectacular action elements that made the first game so good to begin with.  The storyline gets expanded here with this sequel, as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago prepare to make a last stand against the Locust as mankind's days appear to be dwindling down.  In terms of overal gameplay, not much as changed since the first game, but then again, not much had to either.  There have been some minor refinements in terms of the game's cover system, and the difficulty seems more forgiving this time around as well, although it doesn't detract from the moments where the game can be quite challenging.  Drop-in co-op support and XBox Live multiplayer modes are where the real meat of Gears of War 2 is to be found, and the assortment of new weapons, some brutal new attacks, gorgeously rendered environments, and some unforgettable enemies make this game a sequel that measures up to, and in some cases even surpasses, the original.

ADPEAVHFCNLLC,B000ZK9QD2,Poisoned Blade,0,0,"I rented Gears 2 and played through the Single-Player Campaign in 3 days.  It is a true sequel to the original game, so the story is a continuation and the gameplay doesn't really offer anything drastically new.  With that said, Gears of War 2 slightly improves on all of the Campaign aspects of the original Gears of War.The strength of Gears 2 is definitely the Campaign, whether you play single player or with a friend.  Most of the levels are truly epic and now there's moving and destructible cover.  The weaknesses are the multi-player.  There's some lag and starting a game could take a while.  Also, the chainsaw and mortars (explode in the air and release a cluster bomb) seem cheap ways to kill or be killed.The Story 7/10There is one, it's ok, and doesn't bog down the gameplay.  There are a few dramatic scenes in the story, but not enough build up to make them truly memorable.  However, the action never slows and the story does a good job at setting up the levels in the campaign.  The story is an improvement over the first Gears, although that's not saying much.Gameplay 8/10The gameplay is very similar to the original Gears.  Play single player or co-op.  Duck, Flank, Shoot.  But now there are more enemies and more weapons.  The gun battles are really fun and the wide range of enemies keeps the action interesting.  Battle enemies with mortars, flame throwers, gatling guns, lancers, rifles, machine pistols, grenades, shotguns, sniper rifles... etc.  You can also take shields from enemies and plant them as portable cover and of course, you can grab a wounded enemy and use them as a meat shield.  There are also finishing moves like the beat down, curb stomp, and the chainsaw up the a...There are a few enemies that change the battles strategies like tickers.  They're like jihad-watchdog-suicide-bombers.  You need to shoot them before they get close to you and explode.  They definitely get your attention in battles.There are some vehicle levels where you get to mow down hundreds of enemies at a time with a tank.  This is pretty satisfying.There are 4 difficulty levels for the campaign and the checkpoints are very generous.  Just about anyone can finish Gears and the harder levels offer a challenge for the hardcore gamers.There's also a Horde Mode where you and some friends can battle wave after wave of enemies and accumulate a score.  Horde mode is pretty addicting because the gameplay mechanics are fun and the pacing of the battles are intense.Levels 8/10The first Chapter of Gears 2 showcases some of the best looking battles of all time.  You really get the feeling that you are in a war.  Reavers fly into the battles from above, buildings collapse around you, armies of enemies rush onto the battlefield like a gruesome tide of terror.  Gears 2 raises the bar as far as epic battles are concerned in the same way that Call of Duty 4 raised the bar on intensity.  The battles are are something that everyone should experience, even if you just want to rent the game.However, when the game decides to move away from the duck, cover, shoot gameplay, the levels are pretty awful.  Whoever thought 'driving a tank with poor traction on cracking ice and insta-killing them if they fell through' was a fun idea, should be banished from the game industry.

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0010AYJXI,"Cloud ...""""",6,4,"It's kind of an old thing to say now about the long development period that Alan Wake had since nearly everyone who brings up the game asks was it worth the long wait?"" Not so much a question of ""is the game good?"" but rather a question that's posed towards the hype and anticipation more than the game itself. Alan Wake couldn't be seen as just a good or great game you see but a 5 year wait (apparently planned since 2001 but announced 2005) means that this thing had to be the absolute best thing you can buy for your Xbox this year, otherwise what's the point in them taking so long. Now that it is here, it does feel a bit surreal and it's hard not to think about ""wow, we actually have it, like...it's real!"" now we got to ask is whether the game's good. If I don't take into account the long wait, then I'll absolutely say ""yes"". From the superbly told storyline to the occasionally breathtaking graphics and solid voice acting, then I'd say it is but then I think of it's kind of short length, couple of graphical hitches and combat that kind of gets a bit old the more you play and I can say that Alan Wake is definitely worth a playthrough but how great that playthrough will be depends on just how much you're expecting from the game.Story: The story centers on Alan Wake, a successful novelist who unfortunately has hit the most dreaded fear known to his kind: writer's block. Trying to break out of it and take some refreshing visits to the country, Alan and wife Alice arrive at the city of Bright Falls, a small friendly town with a couple of odd locals. But when Alice disappears, people act incredibly erratically and violently and a dark mist/cloud seems to envelop the environment at night, it's clear something's up with the time. But things get even more crazier when Alan realizes the events unfolding have been written in a manuscript for a book entitled ""Departure"" that he himself wrote yet can't remember that he did.Alan Wake uses a clever idea of having the game play out almost like a television episode with a ""previously on..."" opening segment and cliffhangers book-ending each episode. The most common similarities the game has been drawing is that it's like Twin Peaks and some X-Files and maybe even some Lost and for sci-fi/horror guy like myself who absolutely adore the X-Files, this game is nearly a godsend. Paranormal crazy things going on and freaky things happen so when a tree suddenly topples in the distance or a house you're in starts to crash and crumble around you with glass breaking and things flying everywhere, the game gets intense. But where it might differ for you is whether it's scary and to that I say this game is more Dead Space than Fatal Frame or a Silent Hill. This game I doubt will make you lose sleep but you'll sure as hell feel tense when you play it.Graphics: Looking at Alan Wake in the nighttime scenes and you'll think this is one of the more eerie and freakiest games from the unbelievable lighting to the haze/fog that permeates through the forest, this game oozes atmosphere and it's all the more creepier for it. And I can't say more great things about the lighting from the flares you drop and the ones you shoot, this game looks stunning. But then you get to the daytime scenes and you run into incredible vistas that look almost painterly and you're like ""wow, they didn't need to make it that detailed but they sure went whole nine yards to make it look great"". That is until you notice some strange facial animation, especially in the lip sync and it's got some of the more noticeable screen tearing this side of Darksiders. One time I literally rotated the camera back and forth between a window and the tearing kept returning every time. Also sometimes the cutscenes seem different compared to the in-game so for instance if I walked forward and literally stood a foot from a character in some medium ambient light, the cutscene all of a sudden has me in the doorway with more darker lighting. Alan himself is...okay in that his running animation looks oddly funny but the slow-mo dodge he can do never gets old.Sound/Music: In order to freak you out, you need some absolutely great sound design and luckily this game has it. Playing with headphones or with a really sweet surround sound setup and the game takes on a whole different feel than if it was in mono. From what sounds like breathing occasionally in-game to the ambient noise to sounds that almost are geared specifically to creep you out even if nothing caused it (I investigated a cabin once, Alan stood still and I could've sworn I heard footsteps on the outside patio). Voice acting is uniformly excellent as well but the writing in some of it is kinda screwy. The tone in Alan's narration is perfect but when it comes down to lines from townsfolk it just doesn't sound right but the actors make do with it. There's even some music that bookends the chapters that's cool and there's one moment that Left 4 Dead 2 players will instantly recognize midway.Gameplay: Alan Wake's ""gimmick"" as it were is the light vs dark mechanic that the story also centers around. Alan 90% of the time in the game will be carrying a flashlight and when the baddies of the game, dubbed the ""Taken"", are exposed to this light or any forms of light and it starts to for lack of a better description, ""burn"" the darkness of them at which point they become way more vulnerable to gunfire. You can carry a couple of nifty tools to get the job done from flashbangs which are basically an insta-kill grenade to a flare you can throw on the ground which sort of acts like a temporary haven or an impenetrable area and a flare gun which doubles as your ""RPG"" and crowd control. Weapons are standard fare from revolvers to shotguns to hunting rifles and that flashlight will also require batteries as focusing your beam, or zooming/iron sight, will drain more battery juice and pretty soon you'll either need to replace the battery or wait till it recharges. The controls for this feel incredibly smooth and the aiming and gunplay feel completely natural and not as cumbersome as some shooters are. The same cannot be said for Alan Wake's handling of his body in that Alan's fine when he's not in combat as far as controlling goes but he tends to run out of breath easily and the dodging mechanic mentioned earlier where pressing RB at the right time triggers an awesome slo-mo dodge will be wildly inconsistent and sometimes you'll perfectly nailed it and other times you're like ""dude I'm pressing the button, dodge already!"" Not to mention this isn't Resident Evil 4/5 AI where they stand around and take turns to come after you or take their sweet time to hit you as this AI is incredibly aggressive which makes for some tense combat but also some frustrating ones from either the control issues above or trying to flee only for them to practically catch up to you regardless. It's best then to turn around and flash the light in their face to temporarily stun them, then book it.That's really the majority of the game though there is some really light puzzle solving to do and there's some mini-driving sections which hint at the once open world design the game was originally going to have but after awhile it might start to get slightly repetitive. The music cue will start up or the cinema showing enemies walking towards you plays and you feel like ""oh great, more combat"" when you're not running through the levels going ""oh great, more forest paths"". In a way the game works the best when the scary stuff interacts with the environment and really makes you feel like something is trying to kill you. For instance, one scene midway through the game has you inside a building that suddenly gets ""dark-i-fied"" and you're asked to escape but when doors burst open, glass shatters and things go bat*** crazy, it gets intense. But then when you're in combat, it starts to feel slightly rudimentary. Another thing is that the game is quite heavy on things you either have to personally collect or just add to a counter and this ranges from radio broadcasts, tv shows you watched (excellent Twilight Zone-esque show here), town history you've read through landmarks, coffee thermoses that do nothing but add to an achievement, can pyramids you have to knock over that does jack all and the more common ones being page manuscripts.See, the game's premise is that its events were once written by Wake though he doesn't remember writing them and these are found in his manuscript for his new novel with pages scattered around the levels. Reading them reveals some brief narration and either a description of events that just recently transpired or more commonly, events that have yet to unfold. So when the pages start talking of a guy with a chainsaw or something possessed trying to get at you, it can either go one of 2 ways: you either read and know of its coming appearance but don't know when it'll happen but the dread will be there or you don't read them at all so that when these events do happen you're like ""whoa, holy crap!"" so it really depends on what you do with them. Personally, I only read the first 2 I found and left the rest for after I beat the game. By the way, you can only find all 106 if you collect the ones found in Nightmare mode after you've beaten the game and unlocked the mode.Recommending Alan Wake for people to play is easy: definately. The atmosphere and storytelling are absolutely stellar and there's some genuinely creepy parts even though the game doesn't feel like it should've taken this long to make. Where it gets tricky is whether Alan Wake is good enough for a full blown purchase since the game outside of the achievements doesn't have much replay value and unless you search everywhere, the game's roughly 10 hours or so and whether or not the game's worth the full price is where it gets hard. The game's certainly great enough to own but not sure if it's worth the buy right now but the game is great enough and warrants a purchase it just depends on how much mileage per buck spent you think you'll get out of it.""",5,Lots of hype but lots of greatness,2010/5/20 0:00
ADPEAVHFCNLLC,B0010AYJXI,Poisoned Blade,1,1,"If you want a psychological horror story that forces you to pay attention to the details while unraveling a supernatural mystery, then this is a rare treat for you.  If you just want to shoot zombies, then you'd probably have more fun playing Resident Evil 5 or Left 4 Dead 2.Concept:  10/10Alan Wake is a famous writer who is struggling with writer's block.  He goes on a short vacation to the Pacific Northwest with his wife to relax and get some fresh air.  Upon his arrival to the quaint little town of Bright Falls, something goes awry and he is sucked into an insane world of darkness.  He quickly realizes that he is living in one of his stories.  A thriller.  But this thriller has been corrupted and is becoming a horror story.Story:  9/10The main draw to Alan Wake is the Stephen King style writing.  This is a very deep and complex story and if you aren't paying attention, you may not understand the ending.  There are plenty of discussions about it on youtube.  The dialogue is very well written and there's some pretty good acting.  I'm not going to spoil anything here, but the more you focus on the details, the more you will get out of the game.Gameplay:  7/10There are two types of gameplay:  Exploration and Combat.This is not an open world game like Skyrim or Red Dead Redemption.  These are levels put together to create very wide areas where you are encouraged to explore and find collectibles.  You can find pages of Alan's Manuscript, Thermoses of Coffee, weapons, ammo, and items.  Most of these just unlock achievements or help Alan in combat.The Combat is very simple and somewhat repetitive.  After dark, the People of Bright Falls become criminally insane lunatics smothered in shadow.  Armed with crude weapons, they try to kill Alan.  To make matters worse, only light can harm them.  Lucky for Alan, he's armed with flashlights (beam), flash bangs (grenade) , flares (timed area of effect), and small arsenal of common guns.  When you see an enemy, you must first get light on them to remove the darkness.  Once the darkness is banished, they're vulnerable to gunfire.  Enemies will charge, throw weapons, and try to hack you to bits and you can dodge or sprint for a short time to escape.  Light in the game represents a safe haven for Alan Wake.There are times when the darkness corrupts objects or flocks of ravens, too.  They become possessed and fly at Alan.  He must dodge, escape, or use light to neutralize the darkness in the objects.  That's pretty much it.  But most people will be playing this game for the story and atmosphere.Graphics:  9/10The graphics are very good.  The Seattle-esque town of Bright Falls looks pretty amazing in the day.  There are snow capped mountains, dense forests, and all of the things you'd expect to see in a small town.  The characters could look better, but they aren't bad.  The art direction did take a Stephen King (realistic and familiar) approach.  What is more scary to you?  A gigantic demon or your maniacally grinning uncle trying to cut your face off with a kitchen knife while he quotes the Bible?  The enemies in the game are not wicked demons sporting curved horns and fanged maws.  They're people who could be your friendly neighbors... except now they're possessed.Sound:  8/10The sound is very good and contributes to the atmosphere.  It does a great job at setting the mood and providing audio cues for gameplay.  The voice acting is pretty good overall.Maturity:  TeenThis is a horror game and is very much like a Stephen King movie.  It's not overly gory and there isn't any nudity.  It is more like an interactive horror novel.Replay Value:  5/10There are 3 difficulty modes and some DLC.  You may also want to play some areas over again to explore and get achievements.  But there is no multiplayer or branching story arcs.Overall:  8.5/10To some people, this game will be a masterpiece.  A perfect blend of psychological horror and action that hasn't been seen since Silent Hill 2.  To others, it may seem like a mediocre action game with a confusing story.  If you're willing to search for clues in the story and pay attention to details, then you will enjoy this game.  If you just want to blow through an action game, then you probably won't like Alan Wake.Buy it if you love complex horror stories.Buy it if you like horror novels.Rent it if you have 7-9 hours to finish the campaign.Avoid it if you just want to shoot bad guys.Avoid it if you like simple stories.",4,Cerebral Horror,2011/12/31 0:00

You play as a writer, Alan Wake, who takes a peaceful vacation to a small hick town called Bright Falls. He's spending the night at a cabin on Cauldron Lake with his wife when suddenly the lights go out. His wife winds up in the lake, he jumps in to save her, then he suddenly wakes up from a car crash. You play thought Bright Falls trying to figure out why you're in your own story and trying to write things back the way they were.The story is great and feels like a top-notch horror/mystery story that you're actually playing. It's a bit overwhelming in spots, but it eventually comes together in the end with great twists. One of the best parts about the story is how it's written out in the game. Alan will narrate as you're playing in a first person perspective and these are also in the form of hints. You can pick up manuscript pages to find out what's going to happen next, but this is more a clue than a spoiler. The characters are well written into the story with amazing voice acting and superb dialog. While the story is the meat of the story the action is the best part.The game isn't just an adventure, but a third person shooter as well. The shooting mechanics are very clever, and not just your typical shoot every guy you see"" type of game play. You have a flashlight and when you hold LT to boost the flashlights light so it can tear apart the darkness on enemies. The way you can tell is very clever. The halo on the enemy will shrink the longer you have the light on them. Once it's gone you can blast away with one of your guns. The developers made the action pretty cinematic due to the slow motion cut aways the game does when an enemy is coming. Yes, the enemies are human somewhat, but you also have to be scared of your environment. The Darkness can possess anything from crates to barrels to trucks and even tractor trailers. When the Taken are gone you still have to watch out for possessed objects even the floor can be possessed and make you fall from deadly heights.You can get bigger flashlights that have more juice, and your weapons can also be passive. Use a flare to keep the Taken away from you to get some breathing room. Use flashbangs to take a group out, you can also use a flare (the most powerful gun in the game surprisingly) which has a cool bullet chase camera. The normal guns are just a revolver, shotgun (auto and pump), and a hunting rifle. Sure it's not a lot, but you don't need rocket launchers and machine guns in this game. It's that clever.Of course navigating the game is also really fun thanks to the simple puzzles and driving sections (which you boost your headlights to take out Taken). The game is almost perfect and everything is perfectly balanced. Even places where you have to use floodlights to take out dozens of Taken or even when you don't have  flashlight and just have to run it's never the same thing twice. The game is fairly long with about 6 chapters, and you'll want more when it ends. The game is broken up into chapters and is played like a TV series with a ""Previously on Alan Wake"" at the beginning of each chapter which is a small recap. There's just so much detail in this game with the radio shows, TV shows, and all the little tid bits that get left out of most games are in here, and it makes you want to savor the game.The game is also gorgeous. This is one of the best looking games available, and it's really something to behold. All the lighting is wonderful, physics are excellent, and the game is technically sound.

Bright falls sounds and  feels like a breathing world and all the inhabitants truly feel alive when they interact with you they show  varied emotions to the point you'll care for some of them.The narration by Alan wake really ties and makes the game feel like your in his shoes. His voice sounds like one that you can relate to if you yourself were experiencing a waking nightmare. A lot of what makes the game and the character of Alan wake special is his determination to find his wife and all the hardship he goes through as he feels the conflict is his own doing. The game will keep you interested storywise but I feel the gameplay is very lacking.Although Alan is a ordinary man he quickly finds himself using firearms with precise aim and dodging like he's a action hero. Maybe he wrote himself having these physical feats? That's my interpretation at least.I really wanted Alan wake to be true horror title but it stumbles in its own genre. I really like Bright falls its a superb setting and atmosphere. Also wouldn't it be cool if it was the mirror town to Silent Hill.

However, things start to go haywire and reality and fiction come together and Wake can't tell which is which. This is Alan Wake, a game that truly offers an excellent narrative experience, compelling gameplay, and stellar atmosphere.Positives:- A Nice Cast of Characters - All of the characters in Alan Wake are interesting, including Wake himself.- A Well Realized World - Whether you're in the Brightfalls Diner or roaming the Brightfalls dark and foggy woods at night, the world that Remedy has created for Alan Wake is oozing with atmosphere. Top notch.- Excellent Voice Acting - Each character has a voice that matches their model perfectly. It all feels very natural, nothing feels forced.- The Storyline - Unlike other games, in Alan Wake you're a writer whose going through marriage issues and other pretty awful things. Add to all of this the fact that your spooky stories have mixed with reality and you're in for one heck of a ride.- Simple Gameplay With a Twist - Alan Wake is at its heart a third-person shooter, but it mixes light into the equation to make it go beyond the norm. Your flashlight, and other light sources around the environment, is a necessary tool if you want to survive this tale.- Graphics - Nice lighting, nicely detailed environments, etc. It looks great.Negatives:- Some Minor Repetition - Most of the combat is the same, so it does become a little bit repetitious at times.- Wonky Animations and Lip Sync - Some of the characters could've animated better during cutscenes.Other than a few minor complaints, Alan Wake is easily one of my favorite games I've ever played.

Sounds pretty decent, doesn't it?AitD struggles pretty much from the getgo with painful controls, a camera system that is great for filming movies, but deplorable for trying to play a game, and an inventory system that, while inventive and original, tries so hard that it forgets what it was trying to do in the first place. Control of the character is difficult enough without straying into combat, which is forced on you repeatedly. And while you're strong enough to ignore bone deep wounds and cuts and bruises, you can't swing a flaming club around faster than a 4 year old trying to bat in the majors.The inventory controls suffer greatly as well, as its easy to pull stuff out and put it back, but it doesn't pause the game to stop the monsters from chewing half your face off. Also, there's no ""holster"" button, a standard staple from FPS time immemorial. So you can end up shooting half a clip while struggling to find the control to pull out your molotov to fight the monster that currently killing you.Its a sad letdown to something that's otherwise rather decent.

A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B00113JSCG,"Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...""",5,4,"Despite being a successor to the early 90s horror series Alone in the Dark, the new Alone in the Dark game is only partially related to those old games. It has its own merits, and its own shortcomings, but does not seem particularly related to previous games and must be considered more as a stand-alone game.The story of the game involves a doomsday cult trying to summon an ancient evil using Edward Carnby, the private detective and protagonist from Alone in the Dark (the original), who has been brought to the present by unknown means and has amnesia. At first, the evil presence (marked by glowing cracks in walls that move and seek out prey as if alive) is limited to a single building, but it quickly spreads throughout the entirety of New York City, leaving Edward trapped in Central Park.As far as stories go, this is a decent one for a survival horror game, and there are a lot of good scares and surprises. In the beginning, you're trapped in a building where the very walls are trying to get you, and in addition you're also dealing with zombies - people swallowed up by the cracks brought back as malicious outlets for the main demon to speak and act through. The main demon's voice is kind of bad, though - it's the same deep monster voice that has basically become a cliche in movies about demons, and it makes the glowing cracks go from unidentified, unintelligent, but malicious entity"" to ""scary-voiced demon guy"". In fact, as far as scares go, the main problem with Alone in the Dark is that you're so rarely alone. Besides the short-lived survivors you encounter throughout the game, you also have a sidekick, Sarah, who comes and goes throughout parts of the game. Well, ""sidekick"" is a bit generous, since there's not a lot of cooperative gameplay involved. But the point is that there's no feeling of isolation; it's more like a disaster movie that happens to have monsters in it.The standard gameplay is a fairly regular survival-horror control system. The game is normally played in third-person, with somewhat awkward tank-style controls (IE you have to walk, then turn, then walk, rather then just turning while you walk). The camera in particular is hard to manage, and trying to look around while moving or anything besides walking in a straight line was pretty difficult to manage. Aiming firearms is done exclusively in first-person, but melee combat has a bit of a unique twist to it - it's done in third person like normal gameplay segments, and swinging melee weapons is done by ""swinging"" the right thumbstick from one direction to another. This works pretty well in most cases, and it changes depending on the weapon being used. For example, with long weapons like 2x4s or swords, you only have the option to swing horizontally or vertically. However, with heavier items like fire extinguishers, you can also use the item as a battering ram to smash down doors.Most of the enemies in the game can only be temporarily defeated by weapons, and must be consumed by fire to be fully destroyed. To this end, innovating ways to use fire as a weapon is one of the most important parts of the game. The most basic form of this is to light a melee weapon on fire by sticking it into the flames; the flames don't last forever, but they're an instant-kill to most of the monsters that you'll face, and the enemy cowers and flees accordingly. In fact, I would say that swinging a burning 2x4 while your formerly aggressive zombie enemies cower and flee before you is probably the most satisfying part of the game. There are other methods as well that must be thought up with more open thinking - things like molotov cocktails and improvised flamethrowers made out of a can of hair spray and a match. While the ""make weapons out of things to defeat your foes"" aspect is pretty much limited to fire, the fact that fire is what destroys your enemies makes it at least plausible.Your inventory in the game is represented by the holsters and pouches in your jacket. The left side of your jacket is used for small items like boxes of ammo or batteries, there's a holster for a gun and a flashlight on your chest, and the right side is used for bottles and cans of various types. The fact that there's a legitimate, actual inventory (you actually look down in first-person to access it, and it's in real-time too so you have to hurry and put stuff together instead of just calmly making a molotov cocktail during a pause) helps with the atmosphere that's being created. In a similar manner, wounds show up on your body and must be healed with either bandages or a first-aid spray. There's no health bar (as with the inventory, all HUD elements are minimal in this game), but you can get a general idea of how injured you are by the status of your wounds (which are still present after being healed, but aren't red and open). You also get a phone/PDA at a point in the game that allows you to make calls and gives you access to a GPS map of the area you are in.In many situations it's necessary to hotwire a car or activate a fusebox (which is done in real time, often with monsters closing in on you) by picking the right wires to spark together. You're often frantically pressing wires together hoping that they're the right ones but doing it quickly enough to get away from the monsters closing in on your car. This is a pretty good part of the game in an atmospheric sense. Driving the car is another thing, though; the controls are wonky and in most cases the demands of the game as far as getting away from giant apocalyptic cracks in the road are a little bit over-the-top. I spent a good hour on what is really a five-minute segment where you're trying to get away from a giant series of cracking roads and earthquakes because the car didn't turn enough, or it turned too much, or I hit another motorist and the car got stuck, or I hit something at a bad angle. The last one in particular is annoying; at the end of the sequence in question, you're supposed to go flying out through a window in a building, but the first time I got there, I assumed that was what was supposed to happen, but I hit it at an odd angle and I didn't go through (I left a mark on the glass though). The next two times I made it there, I tried looking around for other exits but got blocked off. Only on the last time did I realize what had happened and just drive straight into the glass.The graphics in the game are pretty good; the best graphics are the fire graphics, which flicker and dance pretty realistically, while the worst are probably the wounds that Edward receives on his body. The idea's neat, but in actuality they're just the same image copy-pasted onto different parts of his body. The ""slash that ripped through cloth and pierced the skin"" image looks okay when it's on his pants or shirt, but when it's on his jacket it just looks like someone slapped it on like a sticker. Also, you get the same kind of wound no matter how you got the injury. Overall, though, the graphics are decent and atmospheric.The sound isn't bad, but the music just feels wrong. It's a nice attempt at atmospheric music, but most of the time it's not so much ""scary"" as it is ""epic"", with giant sweeping musical interludes and ominous chanting that fits more with ""Carmina Burana"" than a horror movie. It just feels overstated, and not particularly scary. Furthermore, it gets old pretty quickly, too.As a whole, the worst part of Alone in the Dark is its execution. It has a lot of good ideas, and most of the elements taken by themselves are pretty sound. However, the actual execution of the ideas - the controls, the situation, the atmosphere - are all really terrible and frustrating, and the game seems more like a battle against the game itself than against any monsters or puzzles. The interactive environments seem more linear than natural; despite the fact that it's supposed to be stuff that's done in a manner that makes it seem ""realistic"", there's so many scripted sequences that it's hard to get into it.As a whole, Alone in the Dark deserves a 6/10 - good ideas, but poor execution.""",3,Good Ideas - Poor Execution,2008/10/21 0:00

The first thing you'll notice is that Alone in the Dark boasts some wonderfully creepy and spooky environments that drip with eerie atmosphere.  In fact, the areas are so well designed that you'll often find yourself admiring your surroundings while dodging demons and beasts.  The game looks good in general as well, despite a few graphical glitches that occur, while the game's solid score adds to the overall survival horror atmosphere.  What's really sad about Alone in the Dark is that the game's potential to be something special is marred by technical issues.  Namely, just moving around can be a chore.  The control issues that present themselves during combat and puzzle solving only add layers of frustration to the game, which is a crying shame.  Despite it's flaws, Alone in the Dark does present some innovation in terms of it's item inventory use and some dramatic moments that will jolt you out of your chair.  The game's story is intriguing, and there are some great lighting effects too.  All in all, Alone in the Dark is a worthwhile trip that could have been something truly great, but in the end is brought down thanks to it's technical issues.  Still, for survival horror fans, Alone in the Dark is definitely worth a look.",3,"Could have been spectacular, but marred by technical issues",2008/6/28 0:00

The graphics and background as well as animated effects of the game worlds dynamics are astounding so I give kudos to the makers on that part but sadly the horrific camera and movement controls made what could have been a enjoyable game more of a annoying mistake.  There is really no camera control unless you go into first person view which in itself is sometimes problematic especially during fights also when you have to move the motion controls leave a lot to be desired as well as sometimes loosing your sense of direction  in some areas.  The voice cast that were picked for this game also leave a lot to be desired as the actor who did the voice for Edward seemed to apathetic in his roles and it just seemed his acting ability in this game was sub-par as well I won't say he's the worse I ever heard but he definitely isn't the best in this game either as some of the small part character voice cast seemed to do a better job than him.  I don't want to give to much away but I'm sure many people have seen or played the game enough to have heard about the ambiguous ending after the game that left many people like myself wondering What was the point of the game in the first place"".  So is the game remotely worth getting?,  I was able to get the game for $5.00 dollars which is a decent enough price but for my personal point of view I think even $5.00 dollars was too much for this game...""",2,Visually Stunning But Nothing Else To Shout About,2011/3/31 0:00
A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B00113JSCG,"Richard Baker BinaryMessiah""""",1,1,"The Good: Amazing visuals, story, neat gameplay ideas, very creepyThe Bad: Bad physics, stiff sluggish controls, bad combat, driving shouldn't be annoying, some puzzles are badly set upI was so excited for Alone in the Dark for such a long time that I never thought it would be an (almost) bad game. I don't want to rag on this game since the developers did try really hard, so as a courtesy I'm going to start with the positives. The first thing you'll notice are the visuals; they are amazing. The graphics have high res textures, amazing lighting effects, creepy fog, and it's all very dark and surreal. You'll be playing as John Carnby who is trying to find out the secrets of Central Park while trying to stop Lucifer from taking over the world through The Path of Light"".In the beginning of the game everything is very cinematic and pretty fun. The game walks you through the ""mixing system"" where you look in your jacket and mix tons of things together at your will. If you want a molatov cocktail stick a handkerchief in a glass or plastic bottle, light it with a lighter and BOOM! Hey you want it to stick to solve a puzzle? Add some sticky tape and your good to go. Need to light your way through a dark tunnel but need it landed in one precise area without it bouncing? Add some tape to that, or you just take an explosive bottle and shoot it in mid-air...don't worry the John keeps track of the bottle in slow motion it's just your job to time the shot.There are also environmental weapons such as setting 4x4s on fire and lighting enemies up with them, use them to light your path, take fire extinguishers to put out fire, or you can use them as battering rams to take down doors. While the combination system is really fun it does have it's limits, but we'll get to the down sides later. The next thing you'll come across will be the combat and there are more downs than ups too this. The one good part is you can use anything at your disposal. While you can only kill the demons (they are pretty damn creepy) with fire there are multiple ways to do this. Have a health spray, or any type or aerosol? Use your lighter for a mini flamethrower.Another great aspect of the game is everything is seen visually. There are no meters or bars anywhere, so your health is indicated by wounds on John's body. Bleed too much and you get a timer to find some bandages fast. There are also car scenes, and Central Park is kind of a much Grand Theft Auto type map where you can get in and out of random cars to kill ""evil roots"" which are a huge pain in the you know what to find, but more on that later. What's really cool is that if there are no keys you can hotwire the car to start it by matching colored wires, so this gives the game a more of a ""I gotta hurry and get the hell out of here"" type feeling. While these are the main elements of the game there are just way too many down sides.The physics in the game are busted so everything is either really floaty, really heavy, or just plain wonky looking. Nothing really moves around right in the game and this really sucks since a lot of the game is built around physics. When it comes to combat the game just wants to hate you. While there are very little supplies in the game to begin with it's so hard to kill 8 demons when you only have one spray can. While you can only kill with fire is really dumb since you have a gun, but it won't kill them unless you poor gasoline on the bullets. I found this really stupid and when you try to kill the evil roots near the end of the game you will go mad trying to use the little supplies you have for the root, yet trying to fend off the demons.The controls are just really wonky and don't really work. In third person you can only move with the left stick and you swing things around with the right, but the movement is just really limited. This really sucks when an enemy is behind you and you have to fiddle with the left stick to get John to turn around. The driving is also another pain since the physics really suck. You'll stuck on the slightest slope or little rock and your car will go flying. Demons can come rip you or of your car...or rip the car off you and it's really hard to shake them off. Thanks to the crappy physics you just slightly bump something they go flying off yet they can jump 400 feet. The controls just feel stiff and sluggish and they aren't very responsive sometimes, so this makes everything overall harder than it should be. At least the last positive is the voice acting is good, the story is great, and the DVD type skip feature really helps. I can't recommend this game unless you feel like struggling through this annoying game. It's worth playing for the visuals, story, and great gameplay ideas, but you'll struggle more than smile.""",3,The long awaited sequel is ruined by poor gameplay design choices,2012/3/28 0:00

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0012N3T3Y,"Cloud ...""""",6,3,"I find Resistance 2, the sequel to the PS3 launch title Resistance: Fall of Man"", a strange duck indeed. It's a game where the faults of the game are easily identifiable (to me anyway), and I can clearly see some areas that needed a lot more polish or tweaking yet I keep coming back to it, enjoying the ride yet not caring for the bumps. Insomniac, the developer behind the stellar Ratchet and Clank series, in a weird way makes a solid FPS but without the core elements that most FPS games need but they do succeed on quite a number of fronts too so Resistance 2 is a game that annoys as much as it thrills.Story: Taking place immediately after the events of the first game, Lieutenant Nathan Hale is picked up and introduced to soldiers called ""Sentinels"", other soldiers who have been infected with the Chimeran virus and given special abilities which have to be kept in chick with medical inhibitors. They make it back to America where the Chimeran race has practically overrun everything and made it their home and it's up to Nathan Hale to try to bring them down, that is if he doesn't turn into one of them first.Graphics: I mention sometimes in reviews of games where the graphics can be put into 2 categories: the look of the game and the performance of the game. The former is Resistance 2's selling point, particularly in terms of scale. Seeing massive things on screen, tilting your character's head up as you see just how massive something is and you're like ""wow"". The game looks quite good when it deals with the Chimera events such as ships and setpieces, cutscenes and the like. Performance which I categorize as glitches, slowdown, framerate and such are non-existant practically; however the graphics in the game are murky at best. Textures don't really have a lot of clarity and the lighting in dark areas can be atrocious but it's a good looking game when it deals with the bigness of stuff, just not with the little things...literally.Sound/Music: Music-wise the game continues that kind of eerie quality during slow moments with militaristic fanfare and energetic music and it nicely sets the stage though with bullets, grenades and whatever else is flying your way, you're probably not paying attention to them all that much. Voice acting is generally alright but stoic Nathan Hale isn't much of a charismatic or deep hero and squad member commands can be lost in the shuffle of all the chaos. But the epic scale of many of the setpieces is helped by the music and the general loudness of it all.Gameplay: Pretty similar to the first game with spiky grenades, weapons with alternate special abilities (bullseye weapons comes with a ""tag"" where bullets will zero in on a specific enemy, great for strafing while magnum have exploding bullets that can be detonated after they're dead which can make great mini-bombs) but instead of a weapon wheel, the game only gives you 2 gun slots so sometimes you'll debate: should I bring an augur for its fire-through-wall ability or will the enemies be far requiring the sniper rifle FarEye? It's a small gripe but I find the bullseye/carbine combo a good fit. The guns and their added abilities are quite a lot of fun to use and like Ratchet and Clank, I sometimes find myself just changing guns for the hell of it as opposed to Halo or Call of Duty where I generally avoid ""crap"" guns.My one chief complaint about Resistance 2's single-player campaign is that there's way too many trial-and-error moments: moments where you will die and in some, die repeatedly until you figure out the correct strategy. Sometimes winning a certain part was not because of excellent aim or outwitting opponents but was the only time where enemy aim was weaker or I had to hide/shoot. In one part I had to fight no less than 3 missile-launching Titans in a park filled with parked cars that kill you if they explode. Yeah, trying to outrun 3 flaming balls of death while trying to not be near an exploding car is not fun. The chief offender of the game's cheap deaths are chameleons: cloaked enemies that have a one-hit kill that you MUST shoot when you hear the rumbling otherwise you're toast. Problem is he shows up so close to you that you really have to be aiming directly at him when he appears or you're dead and like the other enemies in the game at times, he ignores your delicious squad members and prefers to gun for you. Biased, much?While the recently announced MAG's 256 person multiplayer killed it, Resistance 2 has multiplayer of up to 60 people and as expected, it's a blast. Most of the time I was in team deathmatch where it was almost every man for himself and really no strategizing or breaking off into squads so the playing field is quite hectic but having dynamic objectives where you can have new things to accomplish as opposed to ""kill until your team reaches high score"". Also added is a co-op mode where the campaign is independent of the main campaign and players are broken up into different unit types such as heavy hitters or the healers. Both offer a lot of replayability and you'll probably end up doing this a lot more than the single player.Having played Resistance 2 quite a few times and not having bought it yet (strapped for cash sadly), it's a testament to the team at Insomniac that I actually want to buy this as opposed to other games where I'm like ""Yeah it's fun but I wouldn't buy it"". It's got its issues definately but this is quite a fun shooter regardless.""",4,A flawed piece of impressive,2008/11/4 0:00

The new weapons are all worth using and some of the old ones have been tweaked to perfection. So why am I giving this game a 4? Well, certain parts of it simply feel unbalanced where the difficulty is concerned. What I mean is that sometimes the fight getting you to a boss is much more difficult than the boss itself. And some of the earlier stages are more difficult than those later in the game. You'd expect this sort of imbalance in the real world, but it just feels wrong when it shows up in a video game.

Resident Evil is another example of how you can make a games, which looks great graphically, but is barely playable in terms of controls.To begin with, just to start the game you have to push the following sequence of buttons (or, more like ""push the same button so many times""): Start, X, X , X, X, X, Down, Down, X, X... Are you freaking kidding me???And it's the same throughout the game: every time you need to go to a next Act, or to restart a game because you got killed, it's a miriad of X pushes. Even to upgrade a weapon you have to push X to select the upgrade, then confirm Upgrade by pushing X again, then confirm the confirmation by pushing X again, then when it's upgraded you have to push X yet again to the message that the upgrade has been installed. HOLY COW!!! Who in the hell did come up with this stupidity???Now, I don't know why it was even considered as an option, let alone the ONLY option available, to completely STOP a player in his/her place to shoot and even to reload a gun. But it does seem like every playable character in the game is a complete idiot, unable to handle more than one task at a time: you can either move, or you can shoot, or you can reload your gun, but never the combination of moving and one of the other two.Aiming is also weird: while you're rooted in place, you have to find where in the hell the laser line ends, which is nearly impossible without a full (stereo) 3D, because you can't really tell how far it ends, because it can be pretty much anywhere on the screen (not centered as in the majority of games where you have to aim).The control scheme is the worst of all games in the world. I've complained on bad controls in other games, of course, but nothing comes close to RE5 in this regard: I doubt you can come up with the worst controls for decades to come.As far as the storyline is concerned - it's japanese, so it's all ridiculously cheesy and convoluted, just like pretty much all other japanese games that managed to reach the West. I know some people might like it, so take this as my personal opinion :)All in all, the controls completely ruined the game for me. The graphics are amazing (although the PS3 version, as usual, have gotten a shorter end of a stick, with jaggies appearing/disappearing all the time because of the ""dynamic"" antialiasing, framerate drops, which also causes control lagginess, and many other graphical compromises here and there that have already been mentioned by the [...] reviewers.""",1,Nothing amazing and nothing  new,2009/3/13 0:00

Completely overhauling the series' archaic controls and trite puzzles, Resident Evil 4 ended up being one of the absolute best action games to ever see the light of day. Now Resident Evil 5 is finally here, and from a technical standpoint, the game is a sight to behold. These may be in fact the best graphics to be seen in any game on the market today, with beautifully rendered visuals that are simply eye-popping. The core mechanics from Resident Evil 4 remain intact here, as you play as RE1 hero Chris Redfield and new character Sheva; both of whom are investigating the African nation of Kijuju, and eventually are faced with hordes of infected villagers, mutants, monsters, and other nasties, including good 'ol Wesker. The game is loaded with enough balanced moments of action and tension, and having a partner only makes things even better. Seriously, adding a partner opens up some new dimensions to the gameplay that helped make RE4 so good, using teamwork to take down the baddies and watch each other's backs as well, which simply just makes the game more fun. The only true flaws of Resident Evil 5 lie in its online capabilities. Online co-op has it's share of problems, including not being able to exchange weapons with a teammate, as well as having to wait for the host to restart from a previous checkpoint or get to a new one before jumping into the action. Still, flaws aside, Resident Evil 5 is a sheer blast of an action game and a more than worthy follow-up to Resident Evil 4.

The controls surprisingly are unchanged from what you played in Re4 and it seems that Capcom can't grasp the idea that what worked in 4-5 years ago are old and dated and does nothing but hinder the player. Moving and shooting is the biggest gripe and although many re4 players will say it adds tension to the horror aspect, it doesn't work in this game where horror is obviously absent and Re5 in general is a  3rd action adventure and should be viewed as so. As it also has a cover system that unfortunately appears"" only where the developers placed it.Re5 on its own is great game and adds features that make the game have more replay value.

If you have ever had the same thought and wish you were proved wrong, then Mirrors Edge is for you. You play as a messenger girl named Faith trying to do your job in an oppressed city. The only way for a secret messenger to travel  is by running at the top of the city which is rarely monitored.  It's intense in a way few other games deliver.You often feel like you are the main character ducking, jumping, and running across an entire city. The movements allow you a great variety of options in using whatever technique you want in order to get to a goal. Something I personally like is the fact that you can combine platforming techniques in combat. While platforming is immersive, combat can be repetitive as you will be doing much of the same move. It is possible to play the game without killing anyone but that can be frustrating at times because shooting your enemies is the only way to complete an area without spending hours on it.Everything in the game is beautifully detailed from the rooftops you run on to the glove on your hand.  It is strangely easy to integrate yourself into the game's universe and feel like you are the runner in the game. A very nice addition to the game is runnervision which is added to the easy and medium difficulties of the game. This option helps you see which objects to interact with, and really make you feel like a pro.Multiplayer is not that impressive but...  Most of what it is, is trying to beat another's time at running a certain area. I find it very challenging, because most of the time a fraction of a second is the difference between victory, and defeat.Like I said, definitely worthy of a rental but at this (low) price, I'd buy it.

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00149ND28,"Cloud ...""""",61,56,"Back when I first bought a Playstation 3, I played a game called Assassin's Creed which everyone before its release was hailing as a true next-gen action title. Only when it came out, people found it very repetitive, glitchy and even chore-like where you felt compelled to finish it but not necessarily falling in love with it either. Mirror's Edge is not quite there but it's still one of those titles where the more I want to love, the more the gameplay annoys me, the story is just uninteresting or certain mechanics don't feel well as it should. It's like other games where the uniqueness"" of the whole experience overshadows any faults the game has and while I do feel like I want to play it when it's not on, the more the faults just keep coming.Story: In a totalitarian future, the world isn't dark, grey and dingey Blade Runner-esque but rather it's lifeless, sterile and looks almost boring. With the government controlling information flow and with its own degree of corruption, found along the city's rooftops are ""runners"", messengers/couriers with vital information and packages that they hand off to other runners. But when runner Faith finds her twin sister accused of a murder she didn't commit and a clue is found at the scene, Faith has to get to the bottom of it all, and running like hell.Graphics: Whatever your thoughts on the game, there's no denying the game does have a sense of style. Largely in whites with the occasional bit of colour, it's definately a feat to have bland look great. The entire game is from Faith's point of view so unlike Gordon Freeman who seemed to float up ladders, Faith's entire body will be seen such as when you drop kick, climb ladders, do rolls and whatnot. It really helps the immersion factor and makes the game stand out on its own visually. What might turn people off is the cutscenes which look like a cross between the cutscenes from ""Killer 7"" and a more rounded version of ""Samurai Jack"". While they look fine, the tone of realism and cartoony might seem a bit too disconnected.Sound/Music: The game's anchored by ""Still Alive"" (no not Glados' song from Portal) and that sets the tone for the rest of the music, a kind of electronical ambience. That is when there's actual music since most of it is actually just the city itself from car horns to engine sounds, the sound and music work quite well. Ditto for the voice acting with roles that aren't really standouts but the line readings aren't cheesy or melodramatic and it's nice to actually see a main character in an FPS do more than say a one-liner now and then (Master Chief, anyone?)Gameplay: The game is a unique FP...um, there is shooting elements but it's more of a first-person platformer with Faith jumping over fences and low obstacles or sliding under them baseball-style with the feet right in front of her, which is perfect for low kicks on enemies. Controls take some getting used to but essentially it's up controls such as jumping or climbing up ledges (L1), down controls such as rolling from long falls or sliding under obstacles (L2), a quick turn-around uses for quick getaways or doing wall-runs to higher places (R1) and R2 which handles your kicking and punching. While it's different than X being jump, square being attack etc, it's remarkably intuitive.But then comes the crux of the game's problems: interacting with the world itself. I will say this: when the game's on, it's ON with Faith doing so much acrobatic manuevers, you'd be hard-pressed not to look back and what you did and go ""holy crap, I actually pulled all that off?"" However this also comes with more frequent moments of missed jumps, ledges that should've been grabbed but Faith's hands just stay at their sides or trying to do one move only she doesn't seem to want to actually do that move. Yes it's fun when it gets going and I don't mind challenges but most of this game seems like you're trying to work around the game's control flaws rather than you just being a ""bad player"".Enemy encounters will also be here and one way to deal with them is to, of course run, but on occasions you will have to fight some and pressing square triggers a Reaction time which is basically just bullet-time and helps with nailing the enemies with a drop kick or disarming them. However, sometimes the animation doesn't even register your move even when the gun is ready to be disarmed and making an enemy stagger doesn't allow a disarm either. So instead of getting rid of his gun when he's all winded, I have to wait for him to try to hit me before I can access the ""disarming"" part? Boo. While there is some gunplay, it's a lot more challenging to not fire a single bullet (and there's even a trophy/achievement for it).One thing I should mention is that yes the game is short, depending on how quick you can get through the levels without constantly hearing your bones break underneath you but it's near 6-9 hours for the 9 chapters but with time trials and ghosts (characters entirely in red doing one route which you try to meet or best), there is a great replay value to shaving seconds off your time but as for the main story, it's not super long but doesn't really wear out its welcome either.If it sounds like I'm being too negative then sorry but I know most people will automatically find this unhelpful and that my gripes are me just being a bad player or that I don't appreciate the ""uniqueness"" of it all but sometimes, a game with flaws is a game with flaws and Mirror's Edge has em, as much as I want to say it didn't.""",4,3.5;,2008/11/13 0:00
A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B00149ND28,"Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...""",3,3,"Mirror's Edge is a fairly unique game that's all about the gameplay style. You are running, jumping, sliding, and moving towards a goal, no matter what the obstacles.A critical thing to understand here is that the start-up period of the game is ROUGH. You are expected to be able to wall-jump, balance on thin rails, jump over chasms, and do other challenging things. The controls are going to be hard to get used to. Don't give up. It could be frustrating. Stick at it, and give yourself time to get used to those controls. Keep working through the initial levels. The reward is well worth it.Once you become used to the controls, the game really becomes captivating. You're expected to race top speed through a variety of obstacle courses. You have to think on the fly, react instantly, and pay attention to clues. It draws your mind in to focus on the moment.You can replay levels to try different paths, to try to get a better speed, and simply to have fun. So even if you solve"" a level in one way, there are reasons to go back and replay them multiple times.This isn't a long, drawn out epic game that requires 80 hours of in depth juggling of stats and memorizing family trees. You can get through a complete start-to-finish run of the game in about ten hours. So you can learn all the basics in the game in a long weekend of playing - and then replay given levels that you love as you have time. So on one hand you can rent the game to see what it's like. If the gameplay is a style you adore, then you can keep replaying levels to your heart's content.I think it's important to mention two things.First, again, the start-up challenge is there. Some people will have issues making it through the first level or two. The controls are not ""natural"" for many players to master. Stick with it. Give yourself kudos for trying, and keep at it. It's well worth it.Second, if you get motion sick in games, this game might trigger it. There is a lot of fast movement, deep chasms, and swirling skies. So if you tend to be prone to those issues, you might want to try the game out first to see how well you do with it.So with those things said, this game has an enormous amount of fun to offer.

The first person view, while often dizzying, really creates striking visuals to any passerby. Fast-paced and breathtaking puzzle-action, only hindered by spotty controls. It's often overly difficult to make certain jumps. And the consistency of the controls isn't 100%. Much of this has to do with the fact that it's first person though; the fact that you aren't always looking at your feet or seeing your hands. At the same time though, it feels amazing when you actually get something done right after trying ten or so times. In no way do I regret buying this game. Highly recommended.

A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B00149ND28,Winter,5,5,"Mirror's Edge is the first immersive game experience that can truly capture the high-speed acrobatics of Parkour and fuse it with an action game that, in defiance of years of shooters, actually demands that you think of your own survival first.  The beauty of it is that there are times when you start thinking like a Runner and suddenly you're doing combination moves that you figured out an instant before you pulled them off:  the acrobatics are fluid and seamless and the environment does a good job of guiding you by sparse colors that light the next object you need in neon red.The downside is that when it doesn't work, it can be very, very frustrating.  Sometimes the combination you need to work to get out of somewhere isn't obvious, or worse yet, it's extremely hard.  You may land on a surface, only to have Faith keep moving and slide off the other side, unable to backpedal under the impetus of your jump.  And of course there are also duh"" moments where the ""wall-run"" button being the same as the ""jump"" button means if you're not spot-on, she does the wrong thing, and away you go into space.Which is the scary part:  knuckle-biting adrenaline moments where you just sealed your doom play out all the way to the crunch of hitting the pavement.  Being shot to pieces leaves you with a slow-mo falling sensation that will give you amusement-park vertigo and near-death-experience chills.  I put this down to simple ""oops"" mistakes, but one larger complaint that looms is that you are a skinny twenty-something in a roomful of heavily armored SWAT and police soldiers, some of whom are carrying belt-fed miniguns.  You are supposed to get a reward for making it all the way through the game without killing anyone, and I find it extremely unlikely, especially on the last level, that this is possible to do.  Even more so, you get a trophy if you can avoid getting shot--I simply do not believe that is possible.This game has been agony and ecstasy for me, and when I beat it I felt exhilarated.  If you are a high-energy gamer who has the patience to try and try again, you will find yourself rewarded.  If not, you should know ahead of time that there's no cathartic blasting your way out of trouble in this game.

While they're great games and all, they take so long to finish and with a busy gaming schedule this year, it's hard to sink another 40 hours into one game when you could've beat 3 others and had a raucously good time on their multiplayers. However with Valkyria Chronicles, not only did it look stunning but it had a unique way of fighting and seemed to have that certain something"" where you probably don't really know what you're getting into but you want it anyway. But we warned, this isn't an RPG to be taken lightly but like a lot of things, the more you put into it then the sweeter the rewards.Story: It's a period meant to feel like Europe in the 1930 though with a couple changes. Europe's divided in 2, The Federation and the Eastern European Imperial Alliance or just simply Empire, the latter of whom tries to do anything and everything to get what they want. What they want is ragnite, a valuable and incredibly useful resource and where it's abundant is the small country in the middle, Gallia, who has ties to neither side. But when the Empire invades and with a strange, powerful race thought only to exist in legend for a weapon, it's up to Welkin Gunther, Alicia Melchiott and several others to bring down the powerful Empire.Graphics: The team behind this game worked on the highly-praised Skies of Arcadia for the Dreamcast and while the art style and character designs are similar, Valkyria is really in a class of its own. Using Sega's Canvas engine, they decide to create a different approach to the visuals and while Okami was made to resemble a painting, Valkyria looks more like a drawing that's being animated at lightning speed and it's gorgeous. Kind of reminds me of the cutscenes for the Final Fantasy Tactics port for the PSP only more colorful. The 3D fighting visuals are also welcome and the ""boom"" and ""ratta"" visuals showing up when you explode something or fire your weapon has a great charm to it. It's not going for realism so don't compare it to tech-heavy games but what it lacks in realistic lighting and photo-realistic characters, it makes up for in style and art.Sound/Music: Ditto for the music which was done by Hitoshi Sakimoto who did the Final Fantasy Tactics, Vagrant Story and Odin Sphere soundtracks though he's probably best known (positively or negatively depending on how you see it) as the composer for Final Fantasy XII. The soundtrack here is pleasing and there's some good themes but it doesn't really have any tracks that can stand outside the game but when it's on in the game, it's welcome. Using an option to change the language to Japanese or English and either or, the voice acting is quite well-done though some roles are either overacted or lacking in emotion but I didn't mind either tracks.Gameplay: One can make a case that Valkyria's combat is a 3D version of a chess match, with soldiers and tanks replacing the rooks and queens but essentially here's how it works: a map reveals your position of your characters as well as known enemy positions. You then select who you want to control (which uses up CP, a certain amount of ""moves"" you can make your characters do with tanks taking up 2 of them), game switches to a 3D view and you can run where you want to go which drains an AP gauge and if you run out, you stop permanently till the next turn. Found in the stages are places that could make good cover such as sandbags. When you've found your spot, you can press R1 which brings up your targeting where you can aim where you want to shoot, throw your grenade or to use a first aid on members with low health and after your turn it's best to crouch and end your turn right away to minimize enemies firing back (which is unfair because they counterattack your attack in addition to when your attack is over so they're really getting 2 shots at you so it's best to end your turn quickly).Here's where it gets fun: you basically have 5 classes from standard scouts with decent weaponry to long-range snipers (Marina is my preferred one due to her cute and deadly bad***ness), shocktroopers with assault rifles, lancers who are perfect for nailing tanks and engineers who can either replenish your ammo, fix/build places for cover or provide tank maintenance though they're more susceptible to damage. Knowing who to use and where to use them is key. Should a character lose all their health, they're knocked out but here's the kicker: they'll be gone forever unless you get a member of your team over, a cutscene will show a medic rushing in and that member is taking off the field, still able to be used later but gone for the rest of the battle. While you get many reserves anyway, it's probably best to keep your entire team alive.Speaking of your team, you get 20 people to use in a battle unless stated otherwise in the battle so that can make levelling up tedious right? Wrong. Using the headquarter tab (the whole narrative is played out like a book with pictures on the page being your cutscenes/battles), you can level up your characters in an amusing drill instructor way but should you say level up your snipers, every single one of your snipers levels up as well and not just whoever you use the most. Your equipment can be upgraded for better accuracy, health and whatnot and your tank can be fitted with spare treads should the enemy blast yours off leaving you immobile or strengtening the range of your fire. But don't think this game is immune to grinding as it's best to click the Skirmishes tab and take on the battles which can be fought as many times as you want and it's not just recommended, it's almost necessary since enemies after a certain amount of time will positively own your *** so why not fight fire with fire and make your guys just as tough.I know this fall and winter has been a particularly crowded season, especially those who own all 3 consoles and the 2 handhelds (like me) but I implore you not to miss Valkyria Chronicles. It doesn't have the advertising of Gears of War 2 or the recognition of the upcoming Final Fantasy XIII but this game is well worth tracking down.""",5,Beauty is not just skin deep,2008/11/10 0:00
A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B0016C3260,"Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...""",18,15,"Valkyria Chronicles"" is a fairly unorthodox game - it's got the art and general handling of ""Final Fantasy Tactics"" combined with the military tactics of ""Full Spectrum Warrior"". Possessing the feeling of an RPG despite taking place during WW2 (or a fantasy representation of it, more accurately), Valkyria Chronicles represents an exciting new game that should be liked by both strategy-RPG fans and the more hardcore military crowd.The game takes place in ""Europa"" - a fantastic version of Europe, where the two dominant countries are the Federation (to the West) and the Empire (to the East). Caught between these is Gallia, a small independent nation rich with Ragnite, the world's fictional power source. The player takes the role of Lieutenant Gunther, the leader of a 20-person unit of militiamen raised to repel an invasion by the Empire.To that end, the player must manage their squad of soldiers and drive back the enemy. From a pool of 50 soldiers (though most have to be unlocked by progressing in the game) the player selects 20 to serve as the active squad. Soldiers can come in one of five types. Scouts are light and fast, but are lightly armored and don't do much damage. Shock Troopers are more heavily armored and armed with machine guns, but are slower than scouts. Lancers are anti-tank troops armed with heavy rocket-tipped lances; they are the most heavily armored, but are only useful when dealing with enemy vehicles. Engineers are armed and armored like scouts, but trade the movement speed of that class for the ability to pass ammo out to comrades, disarm mines, and repair friendly tanks. Finally, Snipers have long-range capabilities and can take out an enemy in one hit if they're lucky, but have slow movement and low defense.Besides their classes, each of the 50 unique characters has their own set of traits that affect their stats in battle. Character traits can reflect everything from upbringing (characters are more at home in their home turf) to sexual preference (some characters prefer to be around lots of women or lots of men) to more individualized personal effects (like a character who gets a huge attack bonus for charging headlong into the enemy's guns, or a character who gets a bonus just by being around tanks). In addition to these traits, characters also have bonds with certain other characters, and will do better when around those characters. Finally, there are certain stats (accuracy, damage, movement) that differ from character to character - but the stats themselves aren't recorded, so the player has to find out for themselves which characters have which statistics.The characters' personalities are revealed through combat - use a character a lot and a newspaper reporter will conduct an interview (off-camera) that puts more information in their biography. This also adds new traits to their character, as well as background information. In addition, each character has unique voice acting, and they will often call out to characters that they have bonds with. All the characters are really fleshed out by their traits and biographies, and it becomes fairly easy to find at least a few favorites that you're likely to use over and over.The gameplay itself is a sort of hybrid between turn-based strategy RPGs and tactical squad games like Full Spectrum Warrior. During a mission, the player usually has 9 soldiers (selected by the player) plus a command tank. At the beginning of every turn, the player has a certain number of command points; these are used to take actions with characters. While using a command point, a character can move a set distance (based on their class) and take one action - either attacking or healing themselves/a nearby ally. Complicating this is Intercepting Attacks: if a character runs into the line of sight of an enemy unit, that unit will fire at him as he moves past. The same is true for the enemy, of course, so it's advisable to set up a position where you will be well defended and where you can counterattack enemies easily as they enter the area. Due to the cone-like nature of weapons fire, using cover is advisable and helpful.Besides infantry combat, the other main part of warfare in Valkyria is tanks. Your side only has one tank, which is upgradable throughout the game. The enemy, on the other hand, tends to have a few more at their disposal, necessitating the use of anti-tank Lancers. Tanks, when hit from the front, may take a while to destroy, but if a character can sneak around the back of the tank and hit its exposed radiator, the tank can be taken down easily. Tanks are very powerful (being equipped with an armor piercing cannon, an explosive mortar, and a coaxial machine gun) but cost 2 command points to take a turn, rather than just 1.Leveling up and advancement is handled fairly simply, compared to a lot of similar strategy-RPGs. At the end of a battle, the player receives gold and experience based on their performance. Gold is used to develop new weapons and armor for your characters. A certain amount of gold is spent to upgrade a specific category (rifles, for example), and all soldiers who use rifles are armed with the upgraded rifle. These weapons are standard issue once developed, and the only customization comes when the development paths split into certain specializations (higher accuracy, higher damage, etc). In this case, you can choose for individual soldiers which weapon they should have. Leveling up works similarly - you invest experience in a class, and once you've spent enough that class levels up. This means that EVERYONE who is a member of that class levels up, regardless of whether or not they're currently in your squad, which means that there's no trouble with one unit getting way ahead of the others in experience terms.I only had a few problems with gameplay. One is that speed is emphasized heavily - not just as a nice bonus, in most cases, but as the major source of experience and money. Completing a mission quickly is worth far more than any points you might get for doing things during the mission, which on the one hand works for players who are willing to take risks and rush in, but discourages players who are more cautious and defensive. Another issue with gameplay is that the levels tend to focus more on particular objectives or gimmicks rather than straight-up warfare; almost every level has your squad being split up, or some other condition that makes it harder than simply using regular tactics. Both of these things make the game less fun, and even in Skirmish mode (missions that can be played an infinite number of times to get more money and experience) they pervade the atmosphere of the game.The graphics are incredible - not just in quality, but in style, as well. The game uses a unique colored-pencil style of in-game coloration, so everything has a very artistic feel to it. Some effects - like a tank's movement or an explosion - are represented by sound effects (like ""vrrm"" or ""kaboom"") popping up on-screen, which also serves to give it an ""illustrated"" appearance. The character designs are well-done, while still having a realistic aspect to them and a sort of group appearance emphasized by their standard-issue uniforms. The game in-action is really neat to watch, and the new approach to graphics is appreciated.The sound is decent enough - the English voice acting is well-done, and as mentioned each character has a unique voice and a wide variety of prompts and lines. The music is good, but ultimately forgettable; it serves its purpose as background noise, but isn't particularly enjoyable on its own.As a whole, Valkyria Chronicles is an amazing game that tends to get caught up too much in story and gimmicks. The engine is solid and fun, and the game in basic terms is great. However, the way it's used - the reliance on objectives and unusual gameplay situations - reduces the enjoyment of the system. In addition, the lack of multiplayer is a major annoyance. All-in-all, Valkyria Chronicles is a great game that also feels like a waste, in terms of what is done with the gameplay.8/10.""",4,Strategy RPG plus hardcore military,2009/1/18 0:00

Rhodes,12,9,"Pros+Incredible story+Beautiful graphics+Amazing soundtrack+Unique gameplay that has a lot of balance+A lot of extra things you can do off the beaten pathCons-Your friends and family will feel neglectedSega has, by and large, given consumers a mixed bag of games.  Sometimes you get games that don't live up to the potential that have been set for them and sometimes you get some downright bad games.  When Sega has their head on straight, though, you get a game like Valkyria Chronicles.  It's a rich tale with even richer gameplay.  If there's one RPG PS3 owners must get, it is Valkyria Chronicles.Valkyria Chronicles is set in the year of 1935, but in an alternate reality.  The story itself is told some nicely rendered cel shading as well as some well written and well performed dialog.  The story is told through episodes which you'll undertake.  It's an overall engrossing story filled with fantastic characters who are all well defined.  The cutscenes themselves are also fairly moving.  It's actually quite amazing how deep and mature the story really is.Gameplay wise, Valkyria Chronicles is somewhat different from your typical tactical RPG.  In most tactical RPGs, you and the enemy usually take turns to act.  Valkyria Chronicles does something a little different.  Instead of taking turns you have what is called Command Points.  As long as you still have command points left, you can send forth any unit you like and the order with which you send them doesn't matter.  You could even send one ally to do everything provided you have the correct amount of command points.When you select a unit, however, Valkyria Chronicles throws in another twist.  You view the action on an overworld map, but once you select a unit the game shifts into third person where you must move them yourself as though you were play a third person shooter.  It's actually quite unique and breathes a lot of new life into the Tactical RPG genre.  When an enemy is in sight, you'll have to aim and fire.  The enemy can, if they wish, counterattack you as well.  Just the same however, you can take the proper precautions and duck behind cover if you wish.  There's quite a deep strategic element to the game.  This is not going to be one of those Tactical RPGs where being stronger is all that matters.  It goes much deeper than that.  The game is balanced in such a way that each unit, depending on what they are is useful for different things.  Scouts, for example, are good at pin-pointing where the enemy is, but they lack the firepower to take them down.  Snipers, on the other hand, are good on offense, but lack range and defense.  No matter how you slice it, it's impossible to take complete advantage of the game.  Yet for what it's worth, you never get the feeling the game is too hard or too easy.  It's just right.Providing even more balance is that once you take control of a unit it isn't for an infinite amount of time.  Every unit has an action gauge, and when it runs out they can no longer move.  You're still allowed to take action such as healing yourself or shooting at your enemy at least.  Also, if you decided to keep using the same character over and over again for each command point, you'll notice their action gauge will fill up less and less.  Again, it's designed so that you can't take absolute advantage.On the surface the gameplay is somewhat simple, but it's really quite deep and asks for a lot of strategy on the players part.  After completing each mission, you'll be awarded experience and a ranking.  The faster you get a mission done, the better your experience and ranking.  On the other hand, characters do not level up individually.  Rather their class (be they Sniper, Scout or what have you) levels up.  There's so much depth to the gameplay that you hardly realize the game doesn't actually have online or multiplayer support of any kind.  It'd be nice to challenge a friend online or work cooperatively, but with how engrossing the single player experience is, it's not that big a deal.Visually, Valkyria Chronicles is an astonishing looking game.  It is by far the best cel-shaded game to date.  The artistic design of the environments and characters is vibrant and colorful.  Everything also moves very smoothly, even when things on the battlefield get hectic.  Much like the graphics, the game also sounds incredibly good.  Not only is there a very catchy and moving musical score, but the voice acting is also very well done and distinguished.  It's amazing how much effort Sega went through to draw you into the story.  It works incredibly well.  And if you happen to dislike the English voices, you'll be happy to know you can switch the audio to Japanese.Make no mistake, Valkyria Chronicles is an amazing and enchanting game.  It's got a deep, mature and well thought out storyline with lovable characters, and the gameplay experience is so unique that it's engrossing.  If you're an Tactical RPG fan, Valkyria Chronicles is a must own title.",5,An Original and Engrossing Game,2008/12/25 0:00

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B001B1W3GG,"Cloud ...""""",22,19,"For awhile, Bioshock was the clincher when it came down to next-gen consoles. With only money and room for one, I had to choose which system to get so when it was announced the highly acclaimed game was being released to the Playstation 3, well I was sold. Not only being able to play multiplatform games but also some solid exclusives, the important thing was that I had to play this. A game that gets this much praise has got to end up disappointing considering the hype, not only from press and critics but my own anticipation, right? Well wrong as this is one of the most captivating games I've played recently and whether you got an Xbox 360 or a PS3 (keyword being or""), Bioshock's a must-play.Story: In the mid 1940's, an ambitious man named Andrew Ryan got fed up with the bureaucrats, politicians and religious leaders trying to see who can control the populace with the most restrictions from medical experiments to freedom of speech. So he secretly created the world of Rapture, a vast city found underwater. In 1960, an unnamed man travelling on a plane finds himself the sole survivor when the plane crashes in the middle of the ocean. Swimming to a nearby lighthouse, he accesses a bathysphere which takes him to Rapture only instead of finding a thriving city, it's in disarray and strange folk genetically modified roam the halls. You have to work your way through the city and discover why the idyllic city has failed.Graphics: There's certain games that really make you feel a part of the world as opposed to just controlling someone on the screen and like games such as Dead Space, Resident Evil 4 or more serene landscapes such as Shadow of the Colossus, Bioshock is another game that, without fear of sounding cheesy, really transports you to another time and place. The art design, attention to detail and a genuine realism really get you thinking you're in this city under the sea. Fantastic water effects and a feel recreating the old 1940's complete with neon graphics, old-school advertisements not to mention the views outside the windows, this is definately one to HDTV.Sound/Music: Another important part of the game's immersion is the sound design which has all the requisite noises of a place that's been decimated: groans, distant rumblins and things busting out of nowhere, the sound helps create an unnerving atmosphere. It's not necessarily scary but it certainly keeps you on your toes. Also welcome is the voice acting though the 2 main speakers seems to be Andrew Ryan (portrayed by Armin Shimerman, Quark from ""Star Trek"" and the first Principal on ""Buffy"") and Atlas, your CODEC so to speak. The Splicers, the genetically modified residents of Rapture, also have strange ramblings and makes them be set apart from just the screeching of other enemies.Gameplay: Essentially this is a FPS though don't think that's all it is. The key with Bioshock is variety and it's surprising how much combat strategies you can develop on the fly. Basically, your fighting is separated into 2 methods: typical gun stuff like pistols, shotguns, grenade launchers etc while the other is the ""Plasmids"", a medical breakthrough involving genetic experimentation, which allows you different abilities. Use Incinerate to light your foes on fire or find an oil spot on the floor and burn that when they're standing on it for even more burnage. Also, say you light him/her on fire and you think they're going to want to find a water source right? Well thanks to Rapture getting the occasional leak, they're not too far so if they've gone for a bit of a swim, just use your electricity and shock the water. There's others as well such as using your telekinesis to grab grenades and bombs in mid-air and toss em back or reposition traps to your advantage. There's more to be found and approaching combat as never been so...fun.Don't think that's the end of it though as occasionally you'll be seen by a camera, sending in flying armed drones. Sure it's easy to just blow them up but why not hack them using a pipe-based minigame (tedious but works well enough) to make your own personal bodyguards? Or hack a turret and you can even hack health stations in case enemies want to cure themselves only to find because you've hacked it that it makes things worse for them. Hacking ammo, item and inventing ""jukeboxes"" will also decrease the amount of money you have to pay which is a definate plus. Only thing is the pipe minigame where you have to make water flow from one part to the other using different panel forms grows kind of tiresome and there's even some where I ran out of pieces or room to move thanks to dead-ends.All of this will come into use when you hear a roar nearby and you know one thing: a Big Daddy is near. Walking around the hallways is a big dude in diving gear (dude on the cover) protecting a girl called the Little Sister who has in her body ADAM, the genetic material vital to Rapture. In order to get it you have to kill the protector and this bugger is as tough as he sounds. Thankfully with the turrets and bodyguard drones (which admittedly don't last long) to using Enrage on nearby enemies which will actually attack him instead of you, eventually you'll defeat him. Only thing is that you have to do it in stages since you'll frequently die though thankfully nearby Vita-Chambers spawn you back in with his health where you last left off thereby not negating all that hard work. Makes the game easy sure but on the other hand, it never becomes frustrating and you can just play and play and not worrying about hitting dead ends.That's one thing to be aware of with this game as well: it's rather addicting and it's one of those games where you might look at the clock and go ""well I can afford to play a bit more, it's only a simple objective anyway"" only to find out it's 4 AM and needing to get to bed. I was that hooked and despite its hefty 5 Gig install - which is strangely shorter than Devil May Cry 4's 20 minute one - which lasts 10 minutes or so, Bioshock is definately a game to get for your Playstation 3. As for people who already have the 360 version, well unless you're that into the game, you don't really have to bother but for non-360 owners like myself or people who never played it than definately go for it.""",5,Immersive and utterly addicting,2008/10/21 0:00

Featuring an original and philosophical storyline to go along with one of the most wonderfully-realized environments you'll find in an FPS period, Bioshock still packs a punch in terms of visuals and gameplay experience, and packs a good amount of shocks to boot.

A2U7DXDNYBBLQJ,B001B1W3GG,"Shane Windham Shane Windham, author""""",8,2,"My favorite things about this game were most certainly the atmosphere, voicing and storyline. With everything I've seen here, I was expecting stunning graphics and rock-solid controls. Sadly the graphics, while detailed and often inspired, remind me of a pop-happy version of Portal 2. They aren't bad by a long shot. Objects just tend to jump around where resolution is concerned. And your doll-like arm takes away from what is otherwise a very well executed atmosphere of fear. Even with all of the abilities you'll gain (which should make you feel like a fearless superhero), the sound and lighting in this game are going to get under your skin and you'll end up fearful of turning the next corner.The controls feel overly loose. This is not a precision shooter. I almost always found myself wanting to melee wherever possible, to avoid the need for aiming and firing any of the guns in this game. Your field of vision is even more claustrophobic here than what you could expect in other first person gaming experiences. Add to it enemies that disorient you further, and a map that looks simple enough, but doesn't translate well into the world you see before you; and you've got enough cons to draw this game farther from the bullseye than other reviewers have purported it to be hitting.Collectible objects are often difficult to see, and you'll have to be very precise in looking at them in order to retrieve them. Placement of such objects is not well thought out. Too many times I would pick up a recording directly next to a vending machine, and find myself unable to play the recording without activating the vending machine. Switching between left hand powers and right hand weapons sounds like a good idea, but isn't intuitive enough to be called effective.In the end, I thought Bioshock presented a very unique experience, an often insanely frightening environment, and (though I kept hoping the game would improve upon my opinion) a mediocre experience with regard to control, collecting and field of vision. While I am disappointed overall, this still isn't a bad game. It just isn't one I want to pick back up a second time; not even to go after the platinum trophy. So try it before you buy it. For there are better games out there to be played.

The game went on to become a huge classic and sell over a million copies.  Earlier this year, it was announced the game would go to the Playstation 3.  At first glance, it may not seem worthwhile to buy the game on the Playstation 3 if you played the 360 version, but some of the additions and enhancements just might change the minds of some gamers.In the beginning of the game you are an unnamed man who happens to be on a plane that crashes seemingly out in the middle of nowhere.  Luckily, however, there is a lighthouse in sight.  Once you step inside it is quite clear that this is no ordinary lighthouse and soon you descend in the undersea world of Rapture.  Rapture is a totally free society in which no one is ruled by anyone, and it was built by a man named Andrew Ryan.  Unfortunately, Rapture is anything but perfect.  The once perfect world has now become imperfect and is overrun with splicers who thrive on Adam.Bioshock has an incredible story that digs much deeper than simply being about a central antagonist and protagonist.  In the end it'll make you think.  It's a very absorbing game.  Even is how it looks.  It looked incredible on the XBOX360, but the visual experience is enhanced on the Playstation 3 and it looks even better than it did before.  Much of it looks very real.  Even better is the artistic design and attention to detail.  The atmosphere itself is absorbing as well and really makes the world come alive.Throughout the city you'll also find recorded radio diaries that give you a good idea of what happened to Rapture.  The voice acting in these diaries, and throughout the games various cutscenes is incredible.  It really helps anyone become absorbed into the world.Playing Bioshock is an even better experience.  At it's heart it is a first person shooter.  You'll find weapons that you can use to take down the splicers.  Throughout Rapture you'll also find plasmids which you can use to help you take down certain enemies.  Some Plasmids can be used to electrocute splicers, or manipulate others.  There's a lot to BioShock's gameplay that makes it interesting.  In addition to the weapons and plasmids you can also hack the shopping arcades to lower prices, as well as hack security cameras and gun turrets to help you out against your enemies.There's nothing incredibly difficult about it's gameplay.  It's simple enough.  Perhaps a little too simple.  Bioshock is not a game where you ever really permanently die.  If you happen to die you'll respawn from a Vita-Chamber where you'll be able to go right back up to the enemy that killed you.  The enemy's health never changes.  So essentially, if you're stuck you can keep respawning until you kill whatever it is giving your trouble.  This essentially means BioShock is never too difficult.  You may get tired of dying, but you can never die permanently.What exactly is new in Bioshock on the PS3?  Well, the graphics are smoother and you get a new difficulty setting.  While the new difficulty is enticing, it doesn't really add too much.  The enemies are stronger and you pick up less ammo etc., but it's not really enough to entice anyone who owns the 360 version to really pick this one up.  So if you've played one of the previous versions of Bioshock, there isn't really too much here that makes it worth getting again.  At least not for the price tag of the game itself.Bioshock is still an amazing game even a year later.  It may not be worth it to buy the PS3 version if you've played the XBOX360 version already, but if you have a PS3 and you haven't played Bioshock yet, it's worth checking out.",5,"I Chose...

A36UKFV79879MD,B001CU4EJ0,BX Lounger,0,0,"Konami finally closes the trilogy of their best selling Castlevania games with Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia for the Nintendo DS. Released in 2008, it takes the best elements of the previous two games, brings a new story and main character to the table, retains the classic Metroidvania"" gameplay and tops it off with the usual bonus content to bring us, possibly the best one of the Castlevania DS trilogy. It's a great way to end the series on the DS and we all can't wait to see what's in store for the 3DS.Order of Ecclesia follows the new female main character out to defeat Dracula once and for all. Players who went through the previous 2 games know what means: new story (with twists), new castle, new side quests, new & classic enemies/bosses to defeat, collect and equip weapons, accessories & items and the ability to unlock bonus content within the game. Other than the new female main character, you can now collect ""glyphs"" (magic spells you absorb into yourself) and can mix and match two at a time to unleash special abilities to attack enemies or help you overcome obstacles. These glyphs can be obtained by defeating most enemies and bosses. As usual, your can save your progess in save rooms marked with a red square on the map screen.The PROS: With each new Castlevania DS game, there are bigger and better improvements seen and somehow, Order of Ecclesia boats better graphics and music than Portrait of Ruin. Playing as a female character is fun and the new castle/areas are huge and exactly what you want to see in a Castlevania game. The story comes with twists and the side quests return and completing them will net you money and extra items. The difficulty level is gradual and some bosses are harder than others; it's still as challenging as ever. As always, beating the game and fulfilling certain conditions lets you unlock bonus content in the form of extra game modes and a new playable character.The CONS: This game won't change the minds of those who stayed away from the handheld Castlevania games. As good as the game improved on everything here, making it the best Castlevania game on the DS, it's still more of the same which is fine for some people but not for others. While I like unlocking bonus content tucked into the game, it's nothing that you haven't seen before in Dawn of Sorrow and Portrait of Ruin. Hopefully, the 3DS iterations of future Castlevania games will shake things up even further.If you must pick one Castlevania DS title to play, it should be this one. If you have any interest in playing the Castlevania DS titles, start with Dawn of Sorrow and work your way up to Order of Ecclesia. It is clearly the cream of the crop and belongs in your DS library.

A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B001CU4EJ0,"Christopher Barrett Evil Corgi""""",0,0,"I say that with a little hesitation because Symphony of the Night (referred to from here on as SOTN) is such an amazing game.  But having recently played Dawn of Sorrow (referred to from here on as DOS) and Portrait of Ruin (referred to from here on as POR), I can safely say this is the best Castlevania on the DS, and safely say it's the best 2-d Castlevania since SOTN, possibly the best ever... possibly.  But that depends on what you are looking for.  I've played nearly every Castlevania since being hooked on the very first release on the NES when I was 10 or so.  Castlevania 2 was one of my favorite games as a kid and I still enjoy playing the first 4 games on an emulator.Ecclesia is an amazing Castlevania title that really ramps up the difficulty from the previous two DS installments.  The music and sound effects are definitely the best of any Castlevania on a portable system, the tunes are much catchier than DOS and POR.  The other big plus is the story, which is pretty fantastic.  It's full of the usual twists and drama, but done in a very tasteful way without too much melodrama.  With lots of fun side quests and optional dungeons towards the end of the game, replay is pretty high.  Plus there are tons of hidden items and chests, which makes this a real treat for completion freaks.  And it does track everything so that you know when you have completed the side quests, monster appendix, glyph list, and item lists.  YES!The single most amazing part of this game is the glyph system.  It's virtually flawless.  You can steal demon attacks by stealing their glyphs.  This can be done in one of two ways: either taking the glyph that sometimes appears when you beat a certain type of demon, or stealing a glyph that a demon or boss is currently charging to attack.  For example, one particular glyph can only be taken from a VERY tough boss later in the game, and you can't get it after you beat him.  He doesn't always use it, and when he does it charges very quickly.  So he's already tough to beat, but trying to get in close and take the glyph in time adds an extra level of difficulty.  Now once you get various glyphs, you set them into particular slots.  And every attack you use takes some MP (which charges up at a stately pace).  So even your normal attacks are glyphs.  Want to use a knife?  We have a glyph for that.  Want to use an axe?  Hey, we gotta glyph for that!  Shoot lightning bolts?  We got an app... I mean glyph for that!You can eventually pull stronger glyphs later on.  So you can have a more powerful version of the axe glyph, or the rapier glyph.  And then there are some glyphs with do other things, such as flying or turning into smoke.  Fun!  There are a ton of glyphs, and they allow the player to tweak their character to their style.  Later you can have up to three glyph settings that you can change to on the fly.  Useful.The other feature that I love is that you have a pretty open ended exploration of the countryside.  As you advance the story, new areas open up, and you can select an area to go to once you leave the area you are in.  There is a village which you will come to be familiar with, and you 'free' the townspeople as you travel and they offer quests or shops in exchange.  Some of the quests might be 'take a picture of this monster or demon' or 'return my cat' or 'find x number of this material'.  As you advance further in these quests, more armor, items, accessories, and other special things come available.  I love that you can 'find' the original Castlevania soundtrack and play it while playing the game.There are also a couple of optional dungeons that you won't be able to complete until near the end of the game.  They are tough, but they have some good rewards.Speaking of rewards, there are a lot of hidden items in this game.  More than any previous Castlevania I think.  Many are found by pressing down on the cursor in suspicious areas.  Others are found by breaking away blocks or walls.  Then there are the other items which are in the open, just hard to reach.Overall this game has more replay value than any other Castlevania title I have played.  It's classic 2-D Castlevania, and Konami has definitely done justice to the series and given the long time fans something wonderful.  New fans might be turned off by the difficulty, especially at first, but there are plenty of save points, usually near a boss, so it's never too frustrating.Pros:+ Music is among the best of any game on the DS.  Period.  Blows away POR and DOS.+ Gameplay and control is exceptional, character moves fluidly; buttons can be customized.+ Lots of replay, side quests galore, optional dungeons later on.+ Massive amount of area to explore, various countryside locations in addition to the castle later on.+ Overall pretty decent difficulty with some truly challenging boss battles... I mean PUNISHING boss battles.+ Very nice game over screen.  You will be seeing a fair amount of it.+ Glyph system is one of the most creative, fun, and customizable features in a Castlevania games.+ Great story that doesn't really eat up a lot of screen time, lets you get back to the action.+ The classic Castlevania soundtrack can be unlocked in game, and one of the optional dungeons has a tune from Castlevania III remastered wonderfully.Cons:- Some of the areas are pretty straight through and small (like the swamp).- Difficulty might turn off some players, especially near the beginning (Prison and Lighthouse bosses can be tough).Overall this is one of the best 2-d games on the DS, if not the best 2-D side scrolling adventure game on the platform.  It's one of the better Castlevania games ever made.  It stretches the hardware of the DS to its limit and delivers an amazing game for such a small cartridge!  Just an amazing and truly enjoyable gaming experience.",5,Best DS Castlevania.  Possibly the best Castlevania yet!,2010/8/5 0:00

Simply put, you will not play a better third-party DS game that looks and sounds as gorgeous and beautiful as Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia, which provides the classic Castlevania gameplay we all know and love, and features plenty of surprises, twists, and modes of play to keep you coming back to it for a very long time.  Compared to the previous Castlevania games to hit the DS, Order of Ecclesia is a little bit different.  You don't start out with your trusty whip playing as a Belmont or any other familiar face.  Instead, you play as Shanoa and are armed with the new Glyph system, which allows for some very interesting gameplay moments to be sure, granted it takes a little bit of time to get the most out of it.  To be honest, it takes a little bit of time in general to truly see the best that Order of Ecclesia has to offer.  Be warned that this is by and far the most challenging Castlevania game in a while that you'll play (and in my personal opinion, the most challenging since Circle of the Moon for the GBA).  Yes, you will die quite a bit, but if you stick with it you will find some truly rewarding moments that will have your head spinning.  From a technical standpoint, Order of Ecclesia is a gorgeous 2-D game with some brilliant animation and effects.  The voice over work is surprisingly good, and the game's music soundtrack is haunting and beautiful.  All in all, Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia is a stunning achievement and one of the best portable Castlevania games you'll play, and the longer you stick with it through it's tough difficulty, the more rewarding an experience you'll gain from it.",5,A stunning achievement,2008/10/24 0:00

Just two years ago, however, Portrait of Ruin didn't make as strong of a run.  Portrait of Ruin was a good game on its own, yet switching between two characters felt like a gimmick after a while, and it was obvious that some of the exploration was becoming a drag.  Order of Ecclesia works to put some life into the franchise the same way Symphony of the Night did in 1997, and the way Aria of Sorrow did in 2003.  Fans will be pleased to know that it does a great job.Order of Ecclesia puts you in the role of Shanoa as she has to go forth and once again vanquish Dracula.  While Castlevania has never been too much for story, it has slowly begun to put an emphasis on its story through the years.  While it centers firmly on its gameplay, Order of Ecclesia actually has a pretty good story, and Shanoa is easily one of the series's most likable characters.Since 1997's Symphony of Night, Castlevania has abandoned it's level by level design and has a had a more Metroid style approach ever since.  Order of Ecclesia holds onto that, but it also brings back the level by level run.  You'll got to a level"" but you'll be able to explore it in the Metroid style way you've no doubt become accustomed to.  It helps keep backtracking and running around aimlessly to a minimum.  Most of the areas aren't too big either and it's a little hard to get lost.  Yet there are plenty of optional things to do later on that will lead you back to these areas.  So while it has a level by level design, exploring is still encouraged.Order of Ecclesia's biggest strength is its glyph system.  Throughout the game, Shanoa can absorb glyphs that give her certain abilities.  At first it starts off being very basic things such as using a Rapier or being a magnet to shoot yourself from one spot to another.  But they get more complex and allow for several different combinations.  If you enjoyed the soul system from Dawn of Sorrow and Aria of Sorrow, you'll love the glyph system.  It allows for many more combinations than the soul system does and allows you to utilize the glyphs more strategically.Streategy is especially important in Order of Ecclesia.  It's a tough game.  One of the hardest Castlevania titles out there to be sure.  While you probably won't have too much trouble getting through each area, you'll be put to the test in the game's boss battles, and they are by far some of the toughest moments in Order of Ecclesia.Despite that, Order of Ecclesia is as simple to pick up as any Castlevania before it.  Not only that, but the game still has a beautiful art design.  As far as 2D Castlevania games go, Order of Ecclesia has some fantastic art design.  You'll admire many of the backgrounds.  In particular, the boss designs are some of the best the series has ever had.  Artistically it's fantastic.  On the other hand, it's not really a step above Dawn of Sorrow or Portrait of Ruin.The biggest strength of Order of Ecclesia (and the Castlevania series in general) is easily its fantastic soundtrack.  The Castlevania series is well known for having some of the best music in gaming and Order of Ecclesia sets a new high for the music in handheld video games.Order of Ecclesia is one of the best Castlevania games out there.  In terms of the DS games, it rivals Dawn of Sorrow as being the best on the handheld.  If you're a Castlevania fan, you'll love it.""",5,One of the Best Castlevania's,2008/10/28 0:00

This game really has a sence of darkness and the story line is perfect for this type of game. If you are not sure about it then download the demo because if you dont try that you really are missing out on a great game.Plot: The game begins with Batman capturing the Joker after his latest plot and escorting him to Arkham Asylum for imprisonment. Due to the Joker's recent attack on Gotham's Blackgate Prison, a large number of sane convicts have been transferred. However, the Joker, with the help of Harley Quinn, frees all the inmates and closes Arkham Asylum with Batman and Commissioner Gordon inside. Joker then threatens to detonate bombs all around Gotham if someone tries to enter the building. Batman must uncover the full extent of the Joker's plan while contending with the horrors of Arkham and was not expecting much from the game because I had mixed feelings about the demo. But as soon as I put the full game in, it freaking blew my away. The graphics and presentation suddenly hit me when I began to play the intro of Arkham Asylum. They made the visuals and it surroundings so believable that I thought I really had Batman in my grasp to controle. It is obvious from the start that the developers put sweat and tears into the game. Every chapter of Arkham Asylum is well thought out and realized. The gadgets aren't just there for show, they make you use them because of the well crafted level design. The free flow combat is great but if you can produce some combos and add some gadgets and moves into the mix, the hand to hand combat becomes even better.

As a matter of fact it's the best Batman game yet.With the Joker on his way to the gloomy nuthouse it's safe to say that he's not going to be a problem anymore right? Wrong! He deliberately manipulated Batman and many others in order to get inside the asylum and execute an outrageous plan of mayhem and death that involves some of Bats' most famous foes. A long hallucination scene induced by Scarecrow's poison is the highlight of the game.As Batman you have to explore every murky corner of the island from long-forgotten caves and sewers to the high-security penitentiary. There are plenty of thugs and convicts along the way that need beating up and pulverized as well as 240 Riddler challenges. It's not particularly hard but there are some parts of the game that will have you tearing your hair out in frustration and absolutely hooked until you beat it. There's also loads of trophies and some DLC for those who need to get more out of it.Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamil return as Batman and the Joker. To me, and to most people, Conroy IS the voice of Batman. Forget the nobody who has taken over in recent years with poor interpretations like The Batman, and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. If it's not Conroy, it's just not right.However, the only real complaint (and it's a big one) I have of the game is a common flaw among all video games these days.

Arkham Asylum is still a great game, and worth having! Here's why.First, the graphics. The dark, moody, atmospheric cinematography is just great. You are drawn into the story just as if you were watching a well done movie. Then suddenly you are Batman, with powerful attacks, a flowing cloak, swooping take-downs, and a real sense of being an action hero.You've got all the great toys to rappel up onto buildings and leap down onto enemies. You can upgrade your armor, weapons, and toys to keep things interesting. There's a combination of puzzle solving, action sequences, stealth, flying, balancing, sliding, jumping, and more. You are fully immersed in this gothic world.You've got a story mode where you work your way through the asylum taking down the bad guys. You are searching out riddles"" - question marks - along the way to make sure you explore all corners. The map system is great and keeps you on track.There are also challenges - the typical beat x enemies in y seconds type of activities. So you can rack those up as well.One might have thought that, after playing the 2011 Arkham City game that going ""back"" to an older version of Batman would feel dated. But it's just as much fun to play now. The levels hold your attention, the challenges are just the right balance of hard and doable, and again those graphics and feeling of the whole place is powerful. This isn't a shiny-new spaceship. You're down in the depths of a nasty location, and every surface reeks of the danger and destitution.The gamemakers definitely get kudos here for making a game that stands up to the test of time and remains enjoyable.Are there any caveats here? The game is rated T for Teen and this definitely isn't a game for the little kids. There's a harshness to the world which is fairly realistic. But for older gamers, that adds to the appeal. They are ""real"" bad guys you are taking down - not just pink cartoon bunnies. There's a satisfaction in making sure they are put out of action.Well recommended, even if you're just buying it now.I purchased Batman Arkham Asylum with my own funds for the purpose of doing this review.""",5,Still Amazing Gameplay,2012/3/8 0:00

The storyline finds Batman trapped in Arkham Asylum, and going toe to toe with waves of thugs and a number of villains from his great rogues gallery. Utilizing some punishing attacks and inventive gadgets, Arkham Asylum is plenty addictive and offers up enough engaging, easy to pull off combat that you can't help but enjoy what you get here. Not to mention that the game also offers up some great moments of stealth, detective work, and almost everything else you'd expect to do if you were Batman (minus drive the Batmobile, which personally would have the icing on the cake here), and it does it all spectacularly well. There's also over 200 riddles from the Riddler (naturally) to solve in order to unlock a horde of extra content including Challenge mode maps, and the game as a whole looks grim, gritty, and superbly detailed and animated.

The Unreal graphics engine is lovely overall and the voice acting is engrossing. This really does take Batman games to a new level. And the gameplay is very much an original experience in a lot of ways. What bogged the entirety of the experience down for me was how long it took Batman to gain all of his abilities. You're practically through with the campaign before you're the badass you're meant to be. And if you've given up on the experience before then, you end up missing out on something truly phenomenal. Another drawback is that the game often leaves you with little clue as to what you're supposed to do next. And the bat's stealth capabilities are kept to a minimum in this regard. Too many times you'll find yourself in hand to hand brawls with thugs because you've no good way to take them out stealthily. You don't realize just how limited your character is at first until you find yourself being sniped from 100 yards away and you're left with nothing to do about it but hide or run a snake pattern at the gunman until you're close enough to take him out. That doesn't mean this isn't a good game. It's a great game which offers up a fair share of innovations that I look forward to seeing other games picking up on. Just don't expect this to be the greatest gaming experience you've ever had (like some would lead you to believe that it is). I'm a fighter fan, but the combat system here wasn't something that caught me in any major way. It is certainly unique though! The game's style, storyline, voicing and the fact that it's Batman make it feel like a 5 at times. And the true beauty of this game is the puzzling. Solving 100% of the puzzles was more addictive than most any collecting I've ever done in any video game before. It's a game you should definitely own. There is nothing else like it out there at the moment. It just had its pitfalls for me. You, like many others, may think it's a 5 in all respects.

I especially liked the boss fights, many are huge and you have to really use your head to take some of them down, unlike a lot of hack and slash games where they just have an energy bar. All the cool x-ray vision effects and ways to take down your enemies are very well executed. Also the control scheme is cake, compared to a lot of platformers out there and you don't have to try 40 times to get it right. So play the demo, or just pick it up, even with no demo at all its still worth the price, which now it about 39.99.

Combining a wonderfully cheesy grindhouse presentation and some slight tweaks with the classic gameplay that fans of the series know and love, House of the Dead: Overkill is a sheer blast.  Taking the roles of AMS Agent G and foul-mouthed Isaac Washington, Overkill features plenty of frantic shooting action, ridiculously bloody violence, and enough over-the-top moments to keep you interested.  Overkill also boasts some of the best graphics to hit the Wii yet, despite some moments of clipping and slight graphical glitches.  The game also boasts a killer soundtrack, and the game's areas and enemies are well-designed as well, but it's the grindhouse-style presentation in terms of cut-scenes and voice work that really make Overkill worth playing.  The only real flaws in the game lie in its disappointing frame-rate, and the fact that the game ends up being too short, which in itself isn't much of a surprise considering that the House of the Dead games have never been known for being lengthy.  Also, the game's dialogue borderlines on obscenity overkill (no pun intended) which cen be a distraction.

The first I liked was the marked improvement of the detail of the zombies and the effects,  and the soundtrack was also a great plus for the new release.  The second was the 70's campy satire of the storyline which gave it a little humorous ping to all the zombie killing,  the sarcastic lines they have going between the two characters Agent G and Detective Washington were also a good little touch for the game and made it fun hearing them banter back and forth while you're shooting the zombies.  The one thing I truly thank them for is how they did the weapons upgrade in the game,  the game plays in chapters and after finishing the chapter you'll earn money depending on your final score and with that you can either buy new weapons or upgrade your current ones to be more powerful, faster and etc etc.  The one thing you'll not have to worry about in the game play is trying to find ammo another plus, regardless of what weapon you have you'll have unlimited ammo the only thing you'll have to do is reload and not have to spend your time looking in the area or corners for ammo boxes(Ala REUC).  The game extras are pretty cool as well but I still haven't played them all as I have unlocked the directors uncut chapters showing more game scenes in each chapter and am now playing that.

House of the Dead: Overkill plays more on the great HotD series that starting back in the early 90's in the arcades. You play as Agent G with his foul-mouthed partner Isaac Washington (yes he's black!) as you figure out why zombies are plaguing the US. While the story is hilarious, vulgar, rude, and completely dirty there are tons of funny voice acting and dialog to enjoy. The characters are played out very well and you get pretty attached early on (there's only about 8 levels or so) along with the major hottie Varla Gunns.The game plays like a typical on rails FPS where the game controls where you move and you just worry about shooting. The game has many locales from jails, to hospitals, to swamps, to theme parks so you won't get bored one little bit. There are many guns to buy and upgrade along with some great unlockables for beating the game. While you wondering through levels there are a few temp upgrades you can shoot (I wish there were more), such as health, grenades, green blobs that slow down time for a little while, and gold brains. Yes, collect all these brains and you unlock artwork, videos, etc. Now upgrading your weapons is mandatory such as less recoil, clip size, damage, the whole nine yards. You can have up to two weapons equipped and switching back and forth between these two is a great strategy when you have too many zombies to deal with. You start off the game with a pistol and if you save up your money (more on how later) you can buy more weapons. Buying a shotgun first is great since you use all your rounds to clear most of the zombies out and then switch to your pistol to finish off stubborn stragglers.One great thing about OK is that it NEVER gets too frustrating. When you die you start off right where you were with no continues...of course you take a score hit, but people who don't care about this won't break their Wiimotes in anger. The levels are just the right length taking about 10-15 minutes to complete with super fun boss fights. Each boss will have their weak point circled in red and all you have to do is shoot whatever projectile they fire at you and keep on them. The bosses are disgusting, grotesque, and very funny looking. You're probably all this is great, but there's more!MULTIPLAYER MAN!! That's the best ever...while it's the same as single player having someone help you can always be fun. Now, if you beat the game you get the director's cut (I won't say what it is!!) along with being able to dual wield weapons...yes it's sweet, super fun, and adds lots of replay value. Wouldn't that make the game too easy you say? Well use the Extra Mutants"" tweak before each level and you have an extra challenge.

Sadly though, I do feel a bit upset though that there could've upset that there could've been some overlooked greats here like the innovative 3-D Virtua Racing here, as well as Earthworm Jim to just name a few.All in all for what it is worth Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for the Playstation 3 works very well for Sega as a strong and innovative reintroduction to what Sega had made special for video game fanatics young and old back in the 90's. While it is sad that Sega will never be able to duplicate those days with making new systems, they still are showing they still have the stuff with what their classics are absolutely made of. If you have never owned a Genesis system, or are just looking for something completely different, than I absolutely recommend this as a must buy for PS3 owners.Graphics: BSound: B+Price: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B+Overall: B+",4,The Very Best Of Sega,2009/2/11 0:00

Featured here are 40 great Genesis games, as well as nine bonus unlockable games from arcades and Sega's Master system. Sure we get those tried and true classic games seen before on other Sega compilations, such as the Sonic series, the Golden Axe trilogy, the Shinobi, Ecco, and Vectorman games, Altered Beast, Columns, Kid Chameleon, and other old favorites besides; but there are a few new additions here that will definitely hold your interest. Playing the Streets of Rage trilogy, E-Swat, Fatal Labyrinth, the Shining Force games, Alien Storm, Dynamite Headdy, and the always underrated action/RPG Beyond Oasis are all here, and are all still incredibly fun to play. And yes, even though Comix Zone and Phantasy Star II, III, and IV are here again, they're still some of the absolute best examples of what the Genesis had to offer. Even though there are still some omissions that I would love to see on a Genesis compilation like Eternal Champions, Outrun, the Toe Jam & Earl games, or the amazing Gunstar Heroes (though I'm not sure if Sega or Treasure own the rights there), this collection is still spectacular regardless. Bonus unlockable games include the arcade versions of Altered Beast and Shinobi, the arcade smashes Zaxxon and Space Harrier (still no After Burner) as well as the original Phantasy Star from the Master system among others; and there's a wonderful amount of extra material and a lovely presentation as well. All of the games are brilliantly emulated, and play and look as good as they did way back when. All in all, you can't go wrong with Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection if you grew up owning a Genesis or owned one back in the day, and at this bargain price, this collection is even more of a steal.",5,The best Sega collection to ever see the light of day,2009/2/18 0:00

There's also Kid Chameleon, which is a good Mario clone, and the Streets of Rage trilogy.

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B001HWB68K,"Cloud ...""""",16,12,"Halo has a strange place in videogame industry now since it's become a record breaker as much as its become the target of much malign with cries of generic FPS"" and ""overrated"" often heard more frequently than car horns in the city. Now I'm one of those kind of weird guys that will admit sometimes even the best things can have a few imperfections so I'll say that the Halo series does as much things right whereas in other areas it is disappointing to see Bungie not learn from past mistakes. With ODST, the game presents a departure from the main series and it's hard to say whether it's an expansion or a full blown game but it's certainly different enough to set it apart, only slightly since that is the problem with ODST and in a way with the Halo series, they do things exceptionally well; they just rely on that way too often.Story: The story takes place in between the events of Halo 2 and Halo 3 when a Covenant ship does a slipspace jump right in the middle of the Earth city of New Mombasa. You play as the Rookie, an ODST (Orbital Drop Shock Trooper) who's separated from the rest of his squad members and wanders the streets of New Mombasa searching for his fellow ODST's but also the reason why the Covenant are so interested in New Mombasa and what lies under it. The game goes back and forth between Rookie's nighttime search and his teammates encounters with the Covenant during the day.Graphics: Halo 3 was one of those kind of games where from an art design standpoint it does look cool and even has a lot of unique qualities to it but it wasn't one of those games that really showed off what the Xbox 360 was capable of. ODST is simliar in that everything looks nice and things are animated well but there's also things that aren't that stellar. For example, the ship that slipspace jumped caused damage to the city but aside from some cars and UNSC/Covenant vehicles, it doesn't actually look all that devastated. One slight change is the new visor which makes it more easier to see in the dark as well as having allies and foes color-coordinated to easily tell them apart. Not a completely gorgeous game that I'm sure Uncharted 2 and Modern Warfare 2 will bring but works well enough.Sound/Music: Here's the big surprise, the soundtrack in this game is fan-****ing-tastic. The typical energetic themes that happen when things start to get more shoot-y are still there but there's also a tinge of solemn themes and melancholy with some...light jazz? Yeah, there's some piano here and it's kind of haunting and although to some it might not fit the tone of the nighttime scenes, that sense of loneliness is captured quite well. As far as voice acting, only ones that really do their jobs well is the main voice actors, especially Nathan Fillon (Mal from ""Firefly"") but your squad members are still the same boneheaded kinds, you know the ""hey, save some for me!"" kind. One thing I also loved was the sound design on the weaponry, playing on headphones they had such a nice kick to them.Gameplay: What sets ODST apart from the main series is the progression where it's slightly more open ended where the encounters with the Covenant are not as frequent during the nighttime but then the daytime shifts to the more epic encounters including vehicle sections. It's kind of a strange pace because the nighttime scenes are slow and light on action than poof, shootout galore but also it might feel slightly dull since there's not much to the Rookie segments other than the occasional shootout. Oh and the Rookie isn't the Master Chief not only in character but in skills. He can't jump as high, survive a high fall, his melee is somewhat pathetic on Heroic (my first difficulty setting, nicely balanced for once) and his health is similar to the first Halo where you have shields while you have a health meter you need to replenish with health packs. There's a bit more strategy into this now since you can't go in guns blazing now and even Hunters, which were a bit more ""sigh, these guys..."" to ""ohhhhh ****"". And like Halo 3, you can play the campaign co-op for all those who want extra help to tackle Legendary or at least just for kicks so the more irritating encounters are a bit more manageable.Added to ODST is ""Firefight"" which to put it in simpler, and I'm sure familiar terms, is the ODST version of Horde mode from Gears of War 2. Basic rundown is this: you and up to 3 others take on wave after wave of Covenant in hopes of surviving to the next round. After a certain time, the skulls get turned on which change around the tactics of the battlefield. One round you might have a skull where they love to throw grenades with reckless abandon while another has you having to melee in order to get your shields back up. The nice thing about this mode is that it's a bit more frantic since the maps are a bit bigger, the vehicles are added and all the goodies from the campaign are included such as turrets you can rip off and riding around on ghosts and even wraiths. There's 2 complaints I have, the first being the bigger one: there's no matchmaking. What this means is that say you feel in the mood for some Firefight and you want buddies well unlike Gears, you have to invite people in and set matches up which can feel frustrating when everyone's in their own game or not answering. The other complaint is that if one player leaves the game, it screws everybody up and matches entirely ended simply because one player got disconnected or left and while on occasion, gameplay resumed after a few slight hiccups, a lot of times we get good games going than poof, the game decides to end the match even though nobody actually quit or left.The other thing included with ODST is actually disc 2, which Bungie dubbed the ""Complete Multiplayer Experience"". What this means is that the entire multiplayer from Halo 3 is on disc 2 with every single map pack added along with 3 new maps: Orbital, Longshore and Citadel. Of course this is quite the benefit for players to now have 24 maps to play on but then...if you're a Halo fan you most likely already have Halo 3 in addition to all the map packs, paid for or free and having to spend additional money for a multiplayer you already have just for 3 maps is where all the ire is coming from in reviews and fans. Bungie probably could've released disc 1 separately and either have disc 2 a pre-order/limited edition bonus or release the map pack on Xbox Live. As far as the multiplayer is concerned it's the same as ever: fun with lots of maps and gameplay options and plenty of achievements yet just as much racists, homophobes and young, annoying kids as before. Guess that's the price you pay for a fun MP: have to put up with a whole legion of players who love to throw around swear words and racial slurs.Is ODST worth 60? (Price at the store was 64.99 but whatever). Probably not but is it at least worth a buy. I'd say so since Firefight once you actually start a match is quite addicting and for those who never played Halo 3's multiplayer will have a blast but for super hardcore fans, having a short campaign, a co-op multiplayer with no matchmaking and an MP you most likely already own might grind your gears a little bit.""",4,4.5; That's a lot of fight to finish,2009/9/23 0:00
AN81JUYW2SL24,B001HWB68K,Gearhead Mania,0,0,"Halo 3 ODSTI was pleasantly surprised by Halo 3 ODST. After playing through Halo Reach first, followed by Halo 3. I felt there was significant progress made between Halo 3 and Reach. Halo 3 took forever to load if the cache was cleared by playing another game in the Xbox prior to playing Halo 3 (for each session!). That meant waiting 3-5 minutes if I decided to play something before playing Halo 3.Halo 3 had quite a different feel from ODST and Reach, which is why it seemed odd to me why ODST was called Halo 3: ODST. In my opinion, ODST stands by itself with a different storyline and different characters that have somewhat of a tie in with Halo 3 and Halo Reach (Gunnery Sgt Buck for instance).I won't make it a surprise that I feel Halo Reach and Halo 3 ODST are the best Halo games in the entire franchise  - realizing that Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary Edition was just released, I have not played it and cannot comment on it. But Halo 1, Halo 2, and Halo 3 didn't feel as fun as ODST and Reach.ODST has some fun achievements similar to those in Reach, and the graphics are about on-par. I loved the VISR feature in ODST because it helps with dark areas, similar to the night vision option in Reach. The new suppressed submachine gun is kind of cool, but just like the other Halo games, I'd find myself constantly switching to enemy weapons because I'd run out of ammo and needed something in a pinch, or because I wanted to ditch that dinky sidearm for a fuel rod cannon or beam weapon.ODST has a very short campaign compared to Halo 3 and Halo Reach. Most of the rookie's missions through the streets of Mombasa are dark as in lack of light, but the VISR is a nice touch as it highlights important items. The available vehicles are the typical Halo fare, and you get to take down 1 Scarab in ODST towards the end.The voice acting is great. I immediately recognized the voice actors for Buck (Nathan Fillion) and Dutch (Adam Baldwin), but I had to look up the voices for Dare (Tricia Helfer) and Mickey (Alan Tudyk). Fans of Firefly/Serenity will be in for a treat for sure.I wouldn't recommend paying too much for ODST, as it is a very short campaign. But some of the achievements allow you to get neat Avatar awards via Halo Waypoint, and ODST can be purchased for peanuts (in terms of Xbox game prices) these days.Overall: 4/5 stars, very short campaign, should be inexpensive now, good voice acting, similar in feel to Reach which, IMHO, is better than Halo 1-3.",4,"Short campaign, but worth the current price",2011/11/15 0:00
A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B001HWB68K,"Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...""",33,25,"A side-story taking place in the Halo universe, ODST"" puts you in the role of the titular Orbital Drop Ship Trooper - a regular marine compared to the Master Chief, the series' normal protagonist. Using the basic gameplay and graphics of Halo 3, ODST is neat and different in some ways and disappointingly samey in others.ODST follows a squad of drop troopers - primarily through the eyes of Rookie, a silent protagonist. Rookie proceeds through the abandoned, dead city of New Mombasa looking for records of his teammates, who he was separated from. Finding these records allows you to play a segment as another trooper - Buck, the leader, Mickey, the tech specialist, Dutch, the tough guy, or Romeo, the sniper.Rookie's segments are really freeform and open - you explore the city, going through apartments and back alleys and occasionally running into random patrols of Covenant soldiers. The city's AI, the Supervisor, will occasionally try to get your attention by hijacking various city systems - signs will change to point you in the right direction, phones will start ringing, ticket machines will start spewing tickets, crosswalks and traffic lights will change, and so on. These directions will lead you to audio diaries - clues to a side-story - or weapon/ammo caches. All in all, it makes for a really great feel - almost to the level of Silent Hill - and it's backed up by some of the best music in the series.The action stages are pretty good, too, but far more traditional. There is some openness in the levels, but for the most part they're similar to normal Halo 3. This is where the main promise of ODST - the fact that you're playing as a normal soldier - kind of falls flat. You can basically do everything that the Master Chief can do, including but not limited to flipping over cars and punching through tanks. Your health works slightly differently, but it still basically equates to ""if you get hit, go duck behind cover until you recover"". You can get away with running up to Brutes and punching them in the face until they die. All in all, you basically demonstrate the same level of ""super-soldier"" that the actual super soldiers have, as opposed to having to rely on your wits and your guns to overcome your weakness.In addition to the campaign mode, ODST also offers a four-person co-op mode called ""Firefight"". In this mode, the human players attempt to hold out as long as they can against waves of Covenant troops. Like Gears of War 2's Horde mode, this can be a blast with the right people. To add a bit of difficulty into the mix, each wave of Covenant has a special effect attached to them - the ability to dodge grenades, or being more resistant to plasma, and so on. This ensures that the endless waves of Covenant continue to be challenging for as long as you play.The graphics are similar to Halo 3's, but the urban environment is much more well-designed than those in Halo 3. A lot of care went into designing the city and the various signs and objects scattered around it, and the end result feels pretty natural. The sound is really good, too. The most obvious change, sound-wise, is that an injured ODST will pant and groan realistically instead of offering a single grunt like the Master Chief does. This makes it feel a lot more immersive, and is almost worth the fact that - for game reasons - you can heal up really easily and dying's not really that big of a deal.On the whole, I understand why ODST didn't take a more realistic approach, but that doesn't mean it's not disappointing. As a game, ODST is good, but with some eye-rolling flaws that could've been turned into something more meaningful than ""another Halo game"".8/10.""",4,Good with some Eye Rolling Flaws,2009/9/28 0:00
ADPEAVHFCNLLC,B001HWB68K,Poisoned Blade,147,123,"Concept: 7/10Halo 3: ODST introduces a new Special Forces Recon Soldier for the Halo Universe. The Orbital Drop Shock Trooper is a darker, ligher armored version of a Spartan with silent weapons. That's pretty much it.Story: 9/10The story is very well written, well told, and well acted by Firefly and BSG veterans. It is really entertaining and one of the best parts of the game. However, it is told through flashbacks and is somewhat difficult to understand your first time through. You might be confused at times, but in the end, it all makes sense.Gameplay: 8/10It's Halo 3, with a couple new guns and a slight improvement to the health system. Your character sounds 'in pain' when your health is low, reminding you to stay behind cover. There's also a night vision visor that you can toggle on and off. Unfortunately, the game seems too dark if you don't have your night vision on, and if you use it in areas that are fairly well lit, you're almost blinded. In the end, the night vision seems extraneous. The game would have been better if the dark areas were just a bit brighter, but still cloaked in shadows.Level Designs: 6/10There is an open ended city area where you can explore and Convenant troops are being dropped in to battle. This is new to the Halo Universe and it works quite well. Most of the game takes place in New Mobasa, a futuristic African City that is being invaded by the Covenant. The look and feel of the city is pretty impressive, but overall, the levels feel redundant. Fight in corridors, defend an area... You know you've got problems when the Campaign is only 5 hours long, and the Missions feel repetitive.Sound: 9/10The music is foreboding and adds to the grim atmosphere while the effects bring the battles to life.Replay Value: 7/10You can start the campaign after lunch and finish it before dinner.There is a Firefight Mode which is like Gears of War 2's Horde Mode, but ODST features an additional challenge where each wave of enemies has a special behavior like Dodges Grenades."" This mode is for friends and invites only. I understand that Bungie is trying to prevent the Leroy Jenkins of the world from ruining the fun, but it really sucks to not be able to play a pickup game.There are 3 new Multiplayer Maps for Halo 3, too.Maturity - The game is rated M because the Halo series is rated M, even though the action is pretty tame.Overall: 7/10Buy this game if you're a Halo Collector, you've got a bunch of buddies that still play Halo 3 and will use the Maps and Firefight Mode.Rent this game if you just want to play the Campaign. It's only 5-6 hours long.I'd recommend waiting for the price to drop before buying ODST because if you spend $60, you're going to feel ripped off.$35 for this game feels about right.NOTE:  Amazon and a bunch of other stores are selling ODST for under $40 now!""",3,ODST - Overpriced Dark Short Tale,2009/11/3 0:00
A2TCG2HV1VJP6V,B001HWB68K,Ryan Sil. (Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...,0,0,"Having recently gotten an Xbox 360, I would obviously have to pick up at least one installment of Microsoft's/Bungie's flagship franchise for the line of Xbox consoles. However, is it just me or did I pick up the wrong Halo game to begin with? Despite all that I've heard that was glorifying the series, Halo 3 ODST was not the kind of game I'd thoroughly have fun with, simply because it won't let me do that.It seems that the Xbox 360 controller was made for first-person shooters, because it is perfectly aligned with the gunplay in this game. That said, I'm a pretty big fan of how the game controls. It is indeed satisfying to blow off a bunch of mutant aliens with various weapons that you can find and use for your own advantage. You can even swap guns with a corpse's, which is especially helpful if you don't have any ammo. Even so, you also have an effective elbow punch attack.As fun as it is to kill enemies, though, there's only so much of that fun to be had. When you're not fighting a pack of aliens, you're busy wandering around the lonely (yet scenic) environments, and don't be surprised if you end up getting lost. Even worse, most of the game's levels are filled to the brim with empty areas you walk around in, with the clumps of enemies being at certain places. There are some levels that are filled with alien fights, but each level following afterwards is the lonely and dark atmosphere I know I wasn't anticipating.I understand that the levels featuring the battles were flashbacks of the Rookie's missions, but I don't think that means the developers needed to make the dark and lonely levels where he's being nostalgic so BORING....With this in mind, the entire game can be summed up as &#34;You walk...and walk...and walk...Oh, and sometimes shoot, but that's probably not too important...&#34;Then there are the truly fun levels in the game, which sport unique gimmicks such as Warthog driving and Banshee piloting. They are not only remarkably refreshing levels in an otherwise monotonous experience, but the Banshee level has to be my favorite level in the game PERIOD. It is SO much fun to fly the aircraft, and you can even fire at enemies while piloting!Unfortunately, the game is only half-filled with fun, with the other half being total boredom.(Note: I know I haven't mentioned anything about the multiplayer features, but that's because I do not have Xbox Live Gold, and I do not plan on getting it anytime soon.

A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B001HWB68K,Winter,1,1,"On the one hand, Halo 3: ODST"" isn't technically a stand-alone game:  it's an ""add-on"".  On the other hand, the distinction seems more like a way of saying, ""This one isn't as huge as Halo 3...but it still fairly well stands on its own"".  ODST's story dovetails around the events that take place in Halo 3, but unlike the other entries in the Halo series, you are not playing The Master Chief.  This time around instead of a SPARTAN you are an Orbital Drop Shock Trooper, or ""ODST"".  You are less armored, you have to be a bit more careful about your health, and you work more with your teammates.  Another interesting twist is that just as Halo 2 put together segments of story where you play another character, here you switch back and forth among the different characters in the story.  The flash-back/flash-forward way the events unfold can be confusing at times, but by the end it'll make sense as everything that happens comes to a head.The good news is, even if you're not as devastating to the enemy as The Master Chief, your ODST is still a very playable soldier.  While not gifted with a shield, you have a very nice heads-up display that looks a bit like the ""Detective Mode"" in Arkham Asylum:  it doesn't have the ability to see through walls, but it lights up a dark environment, outlines objects, and highlights friendlies and enemies in green and red.  You also have the ability to review objectives, replay audio logs, and look through a very nicely outlined 3D map, all projected across the glass of your helmet.  I thought it was a nice touch that doing these things in the heat of battle doesn't pause the game--if you want to check the map in a firefight, you'd better find cover first.Another nice touch in the single player campaign is that the enemies are a bit smarter:  rather than wait for you to come to them, they will actively chase you down.  They will try to flank you if they can, and they won't hesitate to hop into an empty turret or vehicle to come after you.  The single player campaign isn't as huge as, say, Halo 1.  However, ODST keeps all the multiplayer maps from Halo 3 and adds in three new ones, for those of you who enjoy online action.The single player story is fairly dark; you're walking through the ruins of a city that has been thoroughly invaded by the Covenant.  Empty plazas and burning wreckage seem to underscore the disaster aspect of the story (as do the many bodies scattered everywhere).  The story is propped up with some very good voice acting, including Nathan Fillion (Firefly, the TV Series/Serenity, the movie) and each member of the team you play through seems to have their own distinct personality.If you enjoyed the Halo series, consider this something to tide you over in between titles and you won't be disappointed.  The new character type isn't as enhanced as The SPARTANs, but I found the same amount of enjoyment to the gameplay.""",5,Different?  Yes.  Fun?  Oh My Yes,2010/12/21 0:00

There's always something new if you explore and the more stuff you visit the more staff you can use to build your own level and put stickers on things.Story mode is an ok part of the game, the levels are very creative and the graphics are some of the best I have seen. The puzzles are always changing with many fun things you could do to solve them. Story mode overall can keep you entertained until you finish it.The two-player mode was a good idea at first but soon it got really competitive and started to mess other people up. The 2 player puzzles were a good idea but if either one of the players got greedy then it would take both of them a while to complete it. If there were two screens then it would be a lot easier and then the players could go as far away from each other as possible and not mess each other up.Multi-player mode is a lot better than the two-player mode because the people that play are not usually competitive and they want you to be their friend. Also when you are in two-player mode you can follow the hosts around and even look at their unfinished levels before they are published into the game. If they are more experienced than you then they can give you plenty of tips on story mode and in building mode. If you are the more experienced one then you have a chance to feel like the professional and teach them many things that they didn't know yet. Overall the multi player mode was a great touch to the game.I would recommend this game to children with creative minds but it can be played by people of all ages.",5,"My kid's review, my foreword",2008/11/17 0:00
A2LPJD19MGBNXJ,B001IVXI7C,"Adrian Jenkins southerndudeman""""",1,1,"I bought this game immediately upon release, hearing a ton of hype from critics. And honestly, my first impression was Whiskey Tango Foxtrot?!?"" I couldn't comprehend why people thought this simple, cutesy jump-fest was very fun. After all, I had to look at computer screen tutorials in every level. There was a level that taught me how to RUN. &lt;yawn> What a bother. The game went on my shelf, and there it stood for months, while I slogged through plenty of other dreck on the system.Finally, upon my return from vacation, I decided to give the game another try. And instead of playing the story levels, I went online.And I was blown away.There were thousands upon thousands of online levels, and the strange part was, they were FUN! I was sure that user-created stuff would be a tremendous bore, but here I was, playing level after level after level. One day passed. Five days passed. And after that, I was addicted.But, this was the online stuff. The story levels were still boring, right? Well, as it turns out, after you get through the initial tutorials, the game provides amazing platform action, with plenty of bosses, secrets, challenges, and the like. Initial instincts are often sound, but even an experienced gamer like me can miss the boat. But anyway:The Good:- This game is fun. There's no two ways about it. Yes, it can be a bit cutesy, but if someone is too serious about their gaming to play this, they need to lighten up.- The challenge is there. Try to find all of the items without cheating. You can do it, but you'll be working for a while. Try to get through every story level without dying. It's been a while since I've felt a game was this rewarding.- Variety. After playing through 8 worlds in game, go for a spin online and see literally hundreds of thousands of well-thought-out levels. LBP's heart system allows you to skip the losers, and get right to the great levels.- This game is a blast in multiplayer mode. Up to four people can play together, either from controllers at home, or via LBP's online community. And there are ALWAYS people online (I've never seen less than 10,000, and there are often 100,000 during peak times).- The trophies, for once, are well-thought-out and fun. I have mixed feelings about the trophy system in general, but this one gets it right.The Bad:- The camera. It can be incredibly annoying at times, particularly when you are trying to ace some of the difficult levels. Someone complained that you feel dizzy at times, and I can understand the criticism.- The control can be frustrating. LBP allows the player to move along three different levels within each platform. The computer will often pull you into one of the levels automatically, which was be incredibly annoying when you are trying to pull off a tricky jump or land in a precise location.Neither of these are deal breakers, but it would be nice to see them fixed in the next incarnation.That's about it. I am sorry I missed so many months of solid platform action, but I can't recommend this highly enough. Sony was known for taking chances in the past with their games, and with this one, they scored a home run. Here's hoping that more solid exclusives like this find their way to the beleaguered system.""",5,The best game on the system,2009/8/2 0:00
A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B001IVXI7C,"Cloud ...""""",1,1,"I'm sure there have been many a people wanting the opportunity to do what others do for a living, that which is creating. Whether it's movie ideas, being able to rock out a 20,000+ stadium with your own music or create your own game magnum opus, we want to be able to show people something we've done and put a lot of time, effort and even heart into and go up to someone and say I made this"". However, a lot of us don't have the resources or tech skills and the ability to be taken seriously when we say ""I want to create a game"" and while it sounds like an immense cliche, Little Big Planet pretty much guarantees that. With the abilities to not only create your own levels and share them online but play others, this could well be the game with the longest replay value in a long time.I'll get the technical details out of the way since I'll be spending some time on the ""create"" part and share portions of the game. The game runs in 720p and it looks quite gorgeous. Yes, it's no Metal Gear Solid 4 or Lair but the charm, attention to detail and ultimately the feeling is just there and it feels perfect. The sound is also quite well-done with some lively tunes playing throughout your levels from upbeat to creepy. Sound effects are quite welcome and let's face it: isn't Sackboy just awesome?  Only thing that people might have a gripe with is that the levels exist on different ""planes"", sort of like different positions on the road. But without being able to rotate the camera and see whether a trap is on one plane or the other, it can make it particularly challenging to figure out how to pass a trap since you keep getting nailed.Now here's the meat of the game: the create-a-level stuff. Basically, you're given a blank canvas to pretty much make any kind of level you want. Obstacle courses, races, themed levels to various environments to just plain old puzzle solving. But be warned: your masterpiece will take time and patience and planning out your level takes a bit more work than just slapping things together but it's immensely satisfying seeing your stuff playing out. There is a couple of gripes such as unintentionally springing your own trap or tools you wish the game had such as weather but considering the amount of different levels you can muster, or if you want to and just create levels based off something like a videogame or old movie and it's easy to see where the appeal of the game comes from.  Another is that the tools and options that you can use to create the levels are unlocked within the main story mode so for example if you wanted to create, say a Las Vegas style city with a bunch of neon, you'll find there's actually no template for a city landscape yet so what I do is just play through the main story and unlock as much as I can.Sharing online is another big facet of the game as you can go online and check out other gamers' levels and play through those and if you really enjoy the level, you can ""heart"" so you can play it whenever you want. With the ability to co-op it or just go solo, this is like an infinitely re-spawning game that just keeps adding to your playing roster and can keep you busy for awhile. It's not exactly the fastest service though; I suspect though it's more for the game's popularity then an actual technical fault. And let's be honest: while the game does allow that freedom to create your own levels, some of the custom made ones I played had incredibly vague puzzle solutions and more than once you'd wonder ""how are you supposed to past this part anyway?""The controls for LittleBigPlanet are easy to understand and they'll feel immediately intuitive but on the other hand, some parts aren't as ironed out. Basically it's all about X and R1 with the former being your jump and the latter being your grab, useful for moving objects or grabbing spinning shapes or hanging light bulbs and whatnot. The only real problem is the jumping which is at the same time too sensitive while also being a bit too unforgiving. In a game where physics matter, it's too easy to overshoot your guy off a thin platform into a firey death or you miss entirely. I have the same problem with Mario games at times where your character seems to want to move a few steps past your landing spot and it's hard to slam on the brakes. I call it the ""Butterfingers Syndrome"" of gaming and it makes the game not necessarily frustrating in that Super Mario Sunshine way with the floating platforms in a vast empty void but it certainly sticks out.While games like Metal Gear Solid 4 are undeniably impressive in its production values and direction, its meandering storyline and a not-for-everyone feel sticks out about the game. I found it over-the-top and not as excellent as Snake Eater but I have a feeling Guns of the Patriots will be given numerous Game of the Year awards because of the grandioseness of it all. LittleBigPlanet on the other hand is not only accessible, fun and charming but it's for everyone and these aren't just simply well-designed games with a certain fan base, this is something for everyone all over the world.""",5,Can be the longest game you'll ever play,2008/10/30 0:00

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B001IVXI7C,S. Rhodes,3,3,"Pros:+Nice art style+Intricately designed levels+Design and play your own levels+Great learning curve+Fantastic SoundtrackCons:-A couple of networking issuesTime and time again we've talked more about the potential of the PS3 than about the quality games on the system itself.  When we begin to talk about the PS3 years later, one game will stand out as being among the best in the library: Little Big Planet.  The platformer genre seems like a dying breed.  Little Big Planet makes platforming fun again.  It's a big expansive game that anyone can pick up and play.  Best of all, it can be customized in almost every way.In Little Big Planet you take control of a Sack Boy (or girl).  Little Big Planet doesn't have a story.  But it does have some very intricately designed levels.  Throughout each level you'll find yourself running and jumping and taking down enemies.  On occasion you'll control of vehicles and other contraptions, usually that must be done by taking hold of a switch and flipping it in one direction or another.  You'll also find yourself having to grab hold of other objects to get to your destination.  Each level is filled with complex puzzles and paths to go down.  As you go you'll be able to find items you can use to dress up your Sack Boy in, or to use in level creation.The main campaign isn't too long.  It'll keep you busy for probably 8-10 hours at best.  Just because you've completed the main story, however, doesn't mean it's over.  The biggest attraction to Little Big Planet is without a doubt its customization.  As mentioned earlier, you'll collect items throughout the main campaign that you can use to create your own levels.  What makes the level editor unique is that anything that was used within the game can be used in the level editor.  This gives creative minds a chance to really let go and do whatever they want.  Just the same, there are literally millions of levels put online by users already and even they are filled with other items you can use as well.  There are always new and exciting levels to play through and so there are so many ways to make them.  The main campaign will eventually grow old, but playing through newly created levels never does.Along with creating your own levels you can also customize your own Sack Boy by giving him different clothes to wear, different hair styles, facial hair etc.  The amount of customization is almost limitless.  Even more than that is what your Sack Boy can do.  You can make him smile laugh or frown and cry.  You can make him angry or worried.  You can even take control of his arms and flail them around.Another great thing about Little Big Planet is that you don't have to go at it alone.  Up to four people can play through Little Big Planet at a time and they can do it either locally or online.  It's really fun to let a bunch of friends customize their own Sack Boy.  Not to mention that when flailing your arms you can hit them.Little Big Planet isn't the most difficult game around, but it can give you trouble in certain areas.  Some of the user created levels can be brutal but during the main campaign, your mileage will vary.  Luckily, there are plenty of checkpoints scattered throughout each and ever level regardless of how long or short they are.  In some cases there may be too many checkpoints.  Sometimes you'll run by one only to run by a second one just a few short steps later--sometimes not even encountering a single enemy, pitfall or trap in between.  In spite of that, you may appreciate the number of checkpoints given the challenge of some of the games more intricate puzzles.Visually, Little Big Planet is unique.  It's a side-scroller at heart but it makes excellent use of the Playstation 3's capabilities.  Each and every level is vastly decorated.  The game also has a very unique art style.  There's also a lot of humor found within the game.  From the humble narrator who provides you with all the tutorials, to some of the games more unique level designs.  The physics are also very well done.Without a doubt, however, the best part of Little Big Planet's productions is the soundtrack.  It has some of the best music of any video game.  There are some incredibly catchy tunes here as well as some authentic sound effects.  Video games have rarely sounded this good.If there was any problem with Little Big Planet it would be that it has a couple of networking issues.  Some levels have so much in them that they lag while some people have experienced problems even just uploading, not to mention that some levels will be taken down without any warning from developers.In spite of the networking issues, Little Big Planet is an astonishingly original game.  Regardless of who you are, you've more than likely never played anything like it.  Every PS3 owner should, at the very least, give Little Big Planet a try.",5,One of the Best Games of the Year,2008/12/30 0:00

ADLVFFE4VBT8,B001JKTC9A,"A. Dent Aragorn""""",0,0,"We (me and kids) found Uncharted 2 to show major improvements in every aspect over the Drake's Fortune, its predecessor. The world is bigger and more colorful, the characters are more interesting, the story is... well... more compelling and spread over several sites, the cinematic action and the interactive play blend seamlessly into each other, there's a much better mix between shooting, melees, exploration and chases, there are more weapons and... to put it shortly, if you liked Drake's Fortune then Uncharted 2 is guaranteed to blow your socks off.GAME MODESSurprisingly combat is easier than in Drake's (new weapons such as the Riot Shield help). I won't call myself an above-average gamer. I almost always start playing in the 'easy' mode and I rarely dare the 'difficult' modes but Among Thieves makes it so easy and it's so much more natural and fluid when compared with Drake's. And, without giving away anything, there's a lot more than combat in this game.In the easy mode, the hint system will point you in the right direction, most of the time. This is not exactly an open world like Oblivion or Fallout - you go from here to there and you most do A, B, C before you get to do D but it's all so much fun doing it, you often forget about the constraints.And then, of course, there's the Online modes with voice chats which we haven't had time to try yet. Online supports 5 vs. 5 multiplayer modes and up to 3 players co-op modes.Earnings from online or story mode games can be combined to purchase better weapons or equipment.Oh, and there are trophies, of course. Not to mention that you can record gameplay to show it off later.PICTURE, MOTION, SOUNDIt's a game... it's a movie... :) It's both and they blend together. The color are brighter, the vistas are vaster, the attention to detail is sometimes mind-boggling - rain-drops falling, each one producing circular ripples. Amazing. As for the sound, do surround if you can. 7.1 is well... a blast.FINAL THOUGHTSIt's a 5-star without hesitation. Just go and get it if you haven't ordered it yet. And if, like me, you are not the best gamer in the world, don't worry. Chances are you'll manage. If you have kids, buy it.

Game.It is always a pleasure to play a game where a developer shows attention to the most minute detail. Naughty Dog has gone that extra mile in pretty much every aspect of this game, and has created one of the better single player action titles I've ever played. I'm not sure it's the bestest game that you could ever play in 10000 years!"" or all that, but if you find yourself disappointed with this game, I would say that the problem isn't Uncharted 2; it's you.The Good:Aesthetic: Everything about the presentation of this game screams devoted attention. Emotion is rendered excellent for the characters involved. The graphics are stellar - bright, vibrant colors fill the screen, but the artwork is still magnificent. The voice acting is some of the most solid I've seen in a game (and I've seen a lot of solid voice acting).Control: You have to love the targeting mechanism. Gun targeting is fluid and sensible. Hit detection is excellent. Movement is great. It is as much a joy to play as it is to watch.Difficulty: The difficulty is really well thought out. Do you want a somewhat relaxing journey? Easy is great. Do you want to test your skills? Go hard. There are measurable differences in difficulty here, and it's easy to find the one that best suits you.The (sort of) Bad:(Disclaimer: I yield myself to the criticism of nitpicking, but there are some things I found...strange in this one)Melee/Stealth: Without a doubt, the biggest weakness in the game is the melee combat. Unlike the simple perfection of, say, ""Arkham Asylum,"" ""Among Thieves"" is pretty stupid when it comes to bare-knuckle brawling. I mean, are you telling me that it takes 10+ shots from my AK-47 to bring down an enemy, but I can do it in three punches? Really?!?Stealth is another disappointment. I'm a stealth guy, and let's face it: were I Drake, fighting countless hordes of Russian sociopaths, I would do my best to stay out of their way, as opposed to, oh, going toe-to-toe with them! In this instance, it is just too hard to suspend disbelief. Case-in-point: I am going through a city on rooftops, making absurd jumps, until I decide to...fall to the ground and duke it out with around 15-20 armed Russians who are MOBBING me. It just doesn't make sense.Story: Lots of people have really praised the tale here. I'm not going to be one of them. While there is a good bit of detail given here, this is really run-of-the-mill ""DaVinci Code"" stuff with some ""Indiana Jones"" charisma. I do believe it is accurately compared to a summer blockbuster action movie. However, I rarely praise the story in those, and I'm not going to here. It's not really predictable, per se, but it's certainly not unfamiliar territory, by any stretch. I would have liked a little more daring here.That's it. In short, if you own a PS3, good news. This game (unlike ""MGS4"") is a great reason to own the system. Action, platforming and cinema have never felt so seamless (Hideo Kojima could take a hint at the excellent cinema presentation here, which draws you in without boring you to tears).

A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B001JKTC9A,blackaciddevil,0,0,"Uncharted 2: Among Thieves' plot revolves around the doomed voyage home of Marco Polo from China in 1292. After spending almost 20 years in the court of the Mongol Emperor Kublai Khan, Marco Polo departed with fourteen ships and over six hundred passengers - but when he arrived in Persia a year and a half later, only one ship and eighteen passengers remained. Polo never revealed what had happened to the lost ships. Embarking on a quest to find the lost fleet, Nathan Drake soon realizes that Marco Polo was hiding a much bigger secret. That he had gone on a secret expedition to find the mythical kingdom of Shambhala and to recover the legendary Cintamani Stone, or the Wish-fulfilling jewel"" of Buddhist mythology as its' called. With this information, Nathan decides on a new course by following Marco Polo's trail. This quest pits him against a more formidable adversary than he is used to - a ruthless, rogue paramilitary leader with a private army and an ambition to recover the stone from Nathan for himself.Even though I played the first game and liked it, I never loved it. It seemed way too  much like Tomb Raider to me. I know I'll probably take some flack for saying that but it did to me. However, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves changed all that. This time around, I was more engrossed in the story and felt like I had accomplished something when I finished the game. The story came to a satisfying conclusion and, literally, made me start on the third game almost immediately. It truly is an amazing game that deserves all the awards and praise that it gets. Not only does it push the envelope graphically but in all other aspects as well. I'll go so far as to agree with other reviewers here that you will NOT regret purchasing this game. Playing this game made me a fan of the franchise.On a footnote, I think I might go back and play the first game again and see if my view on that game will change. I'm pretty sure it will.

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B001JKTC9A,"Cloud ...""""",2,2,"In a way I kind of feel sorry for Naughty Dog and their brand new game, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves"". Why is that? Well with the amount of hype not only from Sony, the general press but also from fans, you'd think that this game was going to not only be Game of the Year nominee and even possible winner of one of them but that it was one of the best ever, whether in this generation or any. So naturally because of this, people will label the game ""overrated"", ""not worth the hype"" etc etc but it's all quite sad really because Uncharted 2 is a tremendous achievement not only in game design and graphics but in gameplay/cutscene integration which I'll get to later. With a single player that'll last you roughly 10 hours and a multiplayer/co-op addition that'll surely add some legs, Uncharted 2 promises a whole lot of stuff to keep you busy. This is a case where hype and praise is warranted and hope people can look beyond the naysayer cries and see it for what it is: a landmark release in gaming.Story: The story begins with a literal cliffhanger: Nathan Drake, treasure hunter extraordinaire, has woken in a daze on a train that's hanging off the edge of a huge cliff in the snowy mountains. With a small amount of time left, he's got to escape the train before it crashes below but how exactly he got here, why he's got blood on him and what the mysterious dagger he finds in the snow is for is all part of the winding narrative that's in Uncharted 2. Like the first Uncharted, the story isn't exactly new but the way it's told is riveting, the characters are likable with a villain you actually want to hate for once and some really cool scenes. It's also a lot more varied location-wise which makes for a more ""epic"" story.Graphics: Uncharted: Drake's Fortune was a pretty game sure, but play Uncharted 2 than go back and you'll see just how vast the improvements were. Point of fact, Uncharted 2 is jaw-dropping and they'll be so many moments where you'll think ""holy ****"". Details, color, character animation, location variety from the mountains of Nepal (the snow here is the absolute best and I'm Canadian so I should know, heh) to a war-torn city and probably a technological feat: a train level with an actual progression as opposed to just copy-and-paste environments. Another leap forward is in the area Naughty Dog calls ""active cinematic experiences"": essentially huge moments that you can actual control in. Examples being the E3 demo where a hotel is caving in on itself with you inside actually being able to move around as opposed to this being a cutscene or a quick time event. I have a feeling more and more developers are going to try and integrate these own kinds of sequences into their games.Sound/Music: Some of the best voice acting, bar none. A lot of voice acting in games tends to be overdone, lines have to be shouted, sad lines have to be practically bawling tears and laughs have to be huge and evil but what makes Uncharted 2's VA work so well is how realistic it is from voice inflections to tone, there's barely any moments where you think the VA went a bit too far. Music's like the first one with triumphant thematic themes (points for alliteration, yay) that on occasion are a bit overdone but it's still a really great soundtrack. Sound effects are like the same though pistols still have that unsatisfying click to their shots rather than a nice boom.Gameplay: The whole of Uncharted 2 is largely undifferent from the first game with the game separated into 3 elements: platforming, puzzle-solving and shootouts. Platforming is pretty much the same with Nate hanging dangerously over cliffs though on occasion there were some moments where I couldn't figure out what was actually climbable. Sometimes I'd look around trying to find the stepping stones or ledges I'd need to climb up a wall or cliff face and be like ""where the hell?"" only the game will point it out via a hint and I'll be like ""I SO did not see that"". Puzzle-solving is strangely not as abundant as it was though the ones that are here seem a bit more bigger in scope than the first game. Whereas the first game had things like jumping to nearby platforms to turn statues, Uncharted 2 is almost more Tomb Raider or Prince of Persia-like in their more grandiose puzzles. The last part is where the real fun in Uncharted 2 is. The firefights have been drastically improved from grenades being mapped to L2 always as opposed to having to pick them all the time from the menu and a white line will show where you'd like to throw it or blind-throw. Enemy AI is relatively better though there's the occasional oddity like in the first game but the soldier who fired in all directions isn't here. There's also some really cool Hollywood blockbuster-type moments with my fave being a late game sequence involving hopping to truck to truck during a car chase and of course the exploding hotel.Naughty Dog provided 2 betas for Uncharted 2's multiplayer: one in June with vouchers being offered from websites and even purchasing Infamous while the demo was put out a week or so before the game came out, in part because since they've never really done multiplayer, a testing ground was at least set up to figure out whether they can pull it off. And in a way they have though there's some kinks. There's your standard Deathmatch, Plunder (Capture the Flag), Elimation and a cool variation on King of the Hill where they have to take over certain parts of the map in a specific order to win the game but there's also a co-op mode where you and 2 others play in sections reminiscent of the storyline though it's way more action-oriented. The surprisingly funner mode is called Arena where your team survives wave after wave of enemy soldiers which starts out easily but then they introduce enemies with riot shields that can't be melee'd, soldiers that come out of nowhere to incapacitate you from behind to the minigun toting suckers. What makes it addicting is of course the survival and adrenaline nature but also having 3 tries makes it a bit more friendly as opposed to Horde mode which ended the game if everyone was wiped out or the limited shared lives of Halo 3: ODST's Firefight mode. And all the moves from the single player carry over so if you want to do a big dramatic leap of faith to a ledge down below to escape gunfire or to get a speed boost and surprise an enemy is available to you. Nothing cooler than kicking a guy off a ledge who thinks he can just hang there and get pistol kills all day.However, the kinks I mentioned mainly has to do with the matchmaking. I've been in many matches where the teammates were a higher level than you and not only that, they seemed to be strangely relegated over to the other team and not yours so people in the high 30's and 40's were battling 10's and new players. The downside of this is that perks called boosters can be bought when you reach a certain level that can range from better bullet damage or resistance and it feels a bit unfair to have an entire team given access to way more perks than you. Also some might not like the small amount of maps and even though more will be added, you're going to eventually want some new maps and I believe Naughty Dog is going to be doing more maps so there's a plus. Oh and minor nitpick, while there's no mandatory install, an optional install would've benefited the long times since they can be anywhere from 15 to 20 seconds and it almost feels uncomfortable knowing just how long the game's taking to load. That and the trophies are somewhat easy to get with practically the exact same list as the first game though there's 100 (!) treasures to get which some are rather cruelly hidden with some really out-of-the-way ones and Crushing difficulty actually feels a bit more easier to get than the first. I only got the game Tuesday and I only need Hard and Crushing to get Platinum.Game isn't entirely flawless but there's not a lot of games that can be called this close to perfect. A good analogy to make is that this game is like the leap from the first Terminator movie to the 2nd: the story and action in the first is still good but the sequel practically ups the ante by making the action more intense, story better told and the scale a lot more grander. A must-have in any PS3 library.""",5,Your PS3 collection's naked without it,2009/10/16 0:00

This sequel takes everything that was great about the first game and enhances it tenfold. The graphics, sound design, gameplay and voice acting are all near-perfect. It's just a shame that there's not much replay value to the game as it's rather easy to finish.The adventure this time focuses on Marco Polo's mysterious voyages in the 13th century and the Tree of Life. Nathan Drake's quest is to stop a Russian warlord from exploiting the tree for his own devious means. The game takes us from Turkey to Borneo to Tibet across a wide variety of levels including museums, jungles, war-torn cities, a mile-long train, the same train dangling from the edge of a cliff, and snow-covered mountains. You'll pick up loads of different weapons along the way and you'll never really run low on ammo so feel free to be as trigger-happy as you like. I do wish that it could have been gorier though. However, creeping up on a bad guy and shoving him off a cliff while watching him plummet into oblivion is very enjoyable.On a second go you'll find it easy to unlock more than half of the trophies available, and playing it a second time is worth it for this alone. But beyond this I am sorry to say that Uncharted 2: Among Thieves has little to offer aside from an online multi-player mode, which I am not interested in.I still highly recommend the game and it's an essential purchase for any PS3 owner, whether you liked the first game or not.Graphics A+Sound A+Gameplay ALasting Appeal B",4,One of the best PS3 games,2010/2/1 0:00

I've always loved the movie action hero or video game hero who has the witty humor and smart mouth when faced with danger and Nathan Drake has become part of that iconic group reaching in heights of the likes of Indiana Jones,  other than Metal Gear Solid 4 this was one of the few games that finally pushed me into getting my PS3 and as you play through the levels in a attempt to thwart the bad guys Drake does it with style.  The other thing you got to love about the games are the great characters in it like Victor Solomon Drakes best friend and partner with his daring adventures,  Elena Fisher a young female reporter who can hold her own in a dire situation and is Drake's love even though both try an deny this,  Chloe Frazer another female adventurer from Drakes past as well as romantic connection between them both in the past,  Harry Flynn a rogue who has a past with Drake and Chloe but only has his own interest at heart,  and the bad guy of the game Zoran Lazarevic  who is the one person Drake most stop at all cost.  As you play the game in go against or ally with these people in the game, and the way the makers of the game and the script writer and voice actors put 110 percent in their characters and story is amazing and you'll see why this game is probably the top rated seller of last year without question.

A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B001JKTC9A,"Richard Baker BinaryMessiah""""",1,1,"The Good: Beautiful rich visuals, great soundtrack, superb dialog, story, and voice acting, punchy gun play, astounding level design, fun multi playerThe Bad: Some minor control issues, very difficult towards the endEver since the first God of War the action/adventure genre has been all about cinematic set pieces, pounding soundtracks, and adrenaline inducing combat, and Uncharted 2 pulls out all the stops. You play as Nathan Drake, once again, and this time you are trying to find the Cintamani Stone that Marco Polo died trying to find. Along the way you meet old friends, and make new enemies, but the story is as human and satisfying as ever, with amazing, snappy, and witty dialog and voice acting.The best part about Uncharted 2 are the cinematic set pieces. These completely 1-up the original game when it comes to this. The game starts out with Drake hanging from a train, but to add extra tension the train is slowly falling apart as you climb it. This method of getting your blood flowing is done through out the game, and really helps add to the excitement. The game is made like a Hollywood blockbuster movie with tons of explosions, and guns galore.The gun play is also a step up from the last game along with a more balanced and better scaled difficulty. Before the game was a pain from the start, but now the game slowly gets harder. With a ton of weapons at your disposal, and with each packing a good punch mowing down baddies has never been so fun. Along with the gun play are on rail shooting sections that are pulse increasing mayhem, and a ton of fun, but Uncharted isn't just about the action.The adventure part is well implemented and just as exciting thanks to clever level design, and the puzzles are a little easier to figure out this time around. You really feel like you can do the impossible thanks to the game making you feel like a tiny person in a small world scaling mountains, giant temples, and this is also in part with the camera angles. Naughty Dog learned what worked in the first game, and built tenfold on top of it, and it does show really well.While the controls and animations feel smoother the game does have its issues still. Despite the difficulty being scaled better the game get's overly difficult and unbalanced towards the end of the game. The engine just isn't built for a ton of super tough enemies at once. Dying over and over again just isn't fun, and this really detracts from the excitement of the story. There are some minor control issues that carried over such as Nate moving to cover when you direct him the wrong way if the camera is turned just the right way. He'll get stuck on small ledges and this could lead to frustrating cheap deaths, but other than that the game is fine. The game seems to balance gun play and adventuring a little better now as well which makes the pacing spot on.You can still collect treasures, and unlock new bonuses, and the multi player is pretty fun, but it's no Modern Warfare in terms of depth and strategy. If you love cinematics and story at its finest picking up Uncharted 2, with its beautiful visuals, will keep you pleased.",5,An amazing game with blockbuster movie gameplay,2012/3/28 0:00
A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B001JKTC9A,S. Rhodes,4,4,"Pros:+Absolutely gorgeous game+Strong voice acting and production values+Lots of gameplay+Well Presented Story+Likable characters+Very well written script+Excellent MultiplayerCons:-A Couple of Trial and Error Moments.  There are just moments in the game where it's too easy to die because you just don't know what to doThis review is pretty lengthy...In 2007, just a year after the release of the Playstation 3, a little game called Uncharted: Drake's Fortune dropped down.  It was by far one of the best games on the PS3.  Uncharted: Drake's Fortune was a masterpiece.  Unfortunately the adventure wasn't very long.  Uncharted 2 is much better than the game which precedes it by keeping intact what worked, but keeping the action coming swiftly and even improving on areas the first game didn't do so well in.Uncharted 2 begins in the midst of the action.  Nathan Drake returns and the moment Uncharted 2 starts off he's already in a heap of trouble.  He's been unconscious, and when he comes too he realizes that not only is he covered in a lot of blood, but that he's also on a train car that's perched on the edge of a mountain.  He just barely escapes before the train goes teetering over.  But how did he get there, exactly?  And what's going on?  This is what you're about to find out.  The game begins with you on the train but you'll quickly play through everything which lead him to his current situation.  Throughout the story you'll find yourself meeting a lot of interesting characters.  There's Harry Flynn and an old flame of Nate's named Chloe Frazer.  Together these three are interested in the secrets of Marco Polo's missing fleet.  But their only lead is an old oil lamp that supposedly holds the secrets.  So Nate, Flynn and Chloe opt to break into a museum and claim it for themselves.  Of course, it isn't that simple, and someone else is also after the treasure.  His name is Lazarevic--a war criminal that can be really nasty.I guess we might as well get this out of the way.  Uncharted 2 is absolutely gorgeous looking.  It is by far the prettiest game I've ever seen.  The environments are absorbing and incredible to behold.  Not only is the scenery breathtaking but the actions of the characters are fluid and all of the little details really stand out.  There are few games where I stop and just marvel at how extraordinary they look, but Uncharted 2 is one of them.  The first game was expertly designed as it is, but the second manages to outdo it.  It's one of the few games on the console that showcases just what the PS3 can really do.  The game knows it looks good and directs your attention to all the details.  Despite it being stunning visually, you won't find yourself getting lost much.  There's plenty to explore, but for the most part, Uncharted 2 is rather linear.  There's always a set path ahead of you and rarely anything off the beaten path.  That might be a downer for some, but the adventure in and of itself is still worth it.Looking good doesn't matter if the gameplay isn't great to back it up, however.  Uncharted 2 plays very similarly to the first one, and that's not so bad.  You'll pick up guns and get into gun fights, of course.  And some of them are pretty challenging.  The game utilizes a cover system where you'll duck behind cover, pop up and shoot.  You don't have to do this, but the game has its way of urging.  You can only take so much damage before you die.  Hiding behind objects is important.  Some of it will be destroyed easily, but most of what you hide behind makes for good cover.  If you don't want to shoot most of your enemies you can perform melee combos.  This works much more smoothly and fluently in Uncharted 2 than it does in the first one.  It's much more fluid and precise, though melee combat can still feel like button mashing at times, but at least it isn't useless.  There's also an emphasis on stealth in some areas, and thus stealth kills are also a lot easier to pull off.  Certain aspects have also been improved.  In the first game, for example, throwing grenades used the tilting controls which felt gimmicky.  Throwing grenades is much easier.  When walking across certain ledges you also won't have to do a balancing act using the controller either.  This makes using grenades in the middle of combat much more useful than before.  Though if you adjusted to the first one really well, you can enable those motion controls for grenades.Another aspect that Uncharted is big on is some of it's platforming elements.  As Nate, you'll be hanging from ledges and scaling walls and the like.  You'll also be jumping from certain platforms to the next.  This isn't as dangerous as you might think.  For the most part you'd have to really try to miss a jump.  The game doesn't guide you per se, it's just to say that timing isn't the most important thing.  In fact, in most cases missing a jump comes from jumping too soon rather than too late... or neglecting to take in your surroundings.  But it's pretty simple to get the hang of.There are also puzzle elements to the game.  Most of the puzzles aren't really challenging in the slightest, but you might find your wits tested.  If you ever actually do get stuck on a puzzle or can't seem to figure out where to go, the game has a built in hint system to help your.  The game is willing to point you in the right direction when it needs to but it won't always hold your hand.  For example it might tell you what you need to do but not necessarily how to do it.  A hint will only present itself if you seem really stuck, and if you want you can turn the option off altogether.The pacing of the game is much better than the first.  The action and adventure hardly slows down, but most of all the twists and turns in the story don't feel so awkward.  There's a neat balance of gunplay, puzzle solving and transitioning from one part of the game to another.  The story also isn't bogged down in too many cutscenes, but they do their job.  You CAN skip the cutscenes, though, which is a big plus.  On the other hand, you might not want to.  The cutscenes are some of Uncharted 2's strong points.Presentation in your story is everything and Uncharted 2 does this well.  The script is very well written with some crafty dialog.  Some of which will make you laugh.  Even during moments of gameplay Nate and whoever he's with might start up a conversation, throwing a couple of jokes out there that you might laugh at.  Uncharted 2 isn't a comedic genius of a game, but it hardly tries to be more clever than it actually is.  And through these moments you get to learn about the characters and those you're meeting along the way.  As with the rest of game, the cutscenes are gorgeous and fluent.  The voice acting is among some of the best you'll hear in the video game industry.  And not just that, but the music is also spot on and sets the tone rather nicely.Uncharted 2 has multiplayer.  You can play a standard deathmatch, a team deathmatch, matches where you'll claim territory and capture the flag.  All this is worthwhile because the multiplayer is just so damn addictive.  You don't have to be a pro to get up and go on it either.  All you need is knowledge of the game.  It's amazing just how fun the multiplayer can really be.  There's also a bit of co-op multiplayer where you can play through missions with two other allies and a horde mode as well.  For such a simple game, the multiplayer gives you a lot of things to do, and it's refreshingly addictive.There's not much which really holds Uncharted 2 down.  One thing that might start to grate on some nerves might be that some of the gunfights can be hectic, but the other big part of that just might get on some nerves is that there are certain parts throughout the game that can feel like trial and error at times.  You might have to die before you realize what it is you're actually supposed to do.  Most times upon finding out you might slap yourself and think it's so obvious.  Some of these moments will come from being impatient, others will come because the game throws you into the action immediately after a cutscene where the goal may not actually be to kill what's there but actually to run or something like that.  You just might die in Uncharted 2 several times because at some moments you just don't know what to do.  It's hardly frustrating, but it does mean you might find yourself dying or failing certain parts of the game needlessly.On the other hand, it's nice as to just what Uncharted 2 does add to the experience.  Most of it is more action.  The first game was very much just you running from one gun fight to the next.  Uncharted 2 throws in some interesting bits such as a moment where you have to help an injured ally escape a tough situation while you're constantly being targeted.  Other moments include breaking into a museum and sneaking by the guards without getting caught and much more.  There's just a lot more variety to the gameplay than what you got in the first game.  As a result some moments of Uncharted 2 are just all out thrilling.  There's still the idea of progressing from one gun fight to the next, but it's nice to know there are other things being thrown at you this time around.Uncharted 2 is impressive.  It is easily one of the best games on the PS3.  Those who enjoyed the first one just might like Uncharted 2 better because it improves upon its prequel in various ways and ups the ante.  If you enjoyed Nathan Drake's first adventure... there's not reason not to give his second a try.",5,A Monumental Achievement for the PS3,2009/10/14 0:00

ADLVFFE4VBT8,B001KMRN0M,"A. Dent Aragorn""""",94,80,"We've been a PS3 household ever since the 60GB version came about so, with two pre-teens in the house, we were ripe for a PSP adoption. We actually bought the Ratchet & Clank Pack for a few dollars more because one of my kids was a fan of the game.The Core Pack includes the following:- The PSP 3000 itself in shiny black (a fingerprint magnet)- Manual, promos, registration card, etc.Given the PSP's built-in Wi-Fi and its PS3 integration you can do quite a few things out of the box if you have Wi-Fi or a PS3 but, for a better gaming experience you are going to need a memory stick and, of course, some games. Our bundle came with a 1GB Memory Stick Pro Duo card but we are planning to store a few movies when taking it on the road so we ordered an 8GB. Movies take about 0.5GB. We can still use the 1GB that came with the bundle in a camera.First impressions:I was surprised of how good and versatile and elegant this little console can be. It has most of the PS3 buttons, including one analog joystick, the display is large and bright, the resolution is good (480x272), and it responds quickly to controls. It appears to be solidly built. Unlike prior models, this one comes with a built-in microphone while the sound output can be either through the internal speakers headphones (not included). After charging the battery, my kid was up and running and happy in no time. But, let me proceed with a more structured discussion.Stand alone operation (disconnected):The PSP 3000 will play games or movies delivered on UMD discs or off a Memory Stick card. In addition, it will display photos and play music stored on the Memory card.Networking and Internet connectivity:The built-in Wi-Fi allows the PSP 3000 to access the Playstation Netowork and Playstation Store directly. Off the box, there is an Internet browser, a Search (the Internet) function, several Internet Radio applications and the ability to use the PSP as a Skype phone for as long as one has a Skype account and the PSP happens to be within the range of a Wi-Fi hotspot.PS3 Integration:After the PSP is paired with the PS3, the PS3 can 'push' video, photos, music and even PSP games downloaded from the Playstation Store when connected through a USB wire. When wireless, the PSP can basically take over the PS3 - actually display the PS3's own screen and display photos stored on the PS3, play music stored on the PS3. Movie play is not supported.Interestingly, when playing music, it's possible to play it on the PSP's on speakers/headphones or have the PS3 play it itself, the PSP therefore acting as a remote control device.I suspect that additional capabilities exist that I am not aware of yet.PC integration:Through a USB connection, the PC will see the PSP's memory card as an attached drive. This will allow for music, photo or movie files to be transferred directly to the PSP.Room for improvement:The PSP 3000 comes very close to being the perfect portable game-playing (and more) machine, at least in the Sony universe. Perfection would be achieved if the 'keyboard' interface were improved - it's awful now - if it had touch screen capabilities and if file transfers from the PS3 were possible wirelessly. Also on the wish list, I hope that there were more legal 'digital copy' movies available for the PSP.Rating:It's a 4.5 stars plus, rounded up to 5.",5,It comes close to portable gaming perfection,2009/4/15 0:00

Buy a Sony Memory Stick Pro Duo when you buy this or you cannot save your games !!! - I learned the hard way and had to wait three extra days to have one shipped from amazon.I have owned a DS for a few years and recently upgraded to the DSiXL.  I have been happy with that system and the games, but a few key games caught my eye for this system.  Namely the Final Fantasy titles and the Persona titles.  I have to say that yes, graphically this is the superior system, but the library of games was a little lighter than those for the DS.  But what I am happiest about is the ability to download classic PS1 games onto this system.  Castlevania Symphony of the Night?  Oh yes!  Final Fantasy 7?  Yup.So despite my preference for the library of the DS, I do give this system major kudos and a perfect rating.  It's durable and fits adult hands well also.  The screen is clear, and seems more durable than previous models.  And with the larger hard drive, you can download more content.  And it seems that RAM issues are improved and games load from UMDs faster.Do yourself a favor.  Buy this system and Final Fantasy Crisis Core, Persona 3, and Persona Innocent Sin if you are an RPG fan.  Oh, and FF Dissidia.  I don't know why I waited to buy one!  And I bought it just days before it dropped to $99.99 !  Jerks!Though it appears that Sony might be fazing this system out, it is still a great system and the games are pretty cheap right now.  Many titles are selling for less than $10.  Quality games!  Others appear to be hovering in the $15 - $20 range.  Rarely do I see titles for more than $30, and these tend to be the more collectible or rare titles.Buy it now while it's $99!",5,"It's no DS as far as the game library, but still a great handheld!",2011/12/15 0:00

Really three different GBA's? Four (and soon to be five) DS models? Once the latest and last iteration comes out you tend to think that model should have been the first. Same goes with the PSP since the 3000 is amazing and should have been the 1000 model. The first thing you'll notice when you take it out of the box is the weight. This thing feels light as a feather, and I almost thought it was a fake piece of plastic. This also is a benefit when playing games, and reduces the hand cramps.Another thing you'll notice is it's slimmer, and all the fat has been trimmed off. The D-pad is built better and it concaved on the inside instead of just flat like the original model. The speakers are located at the top front instead of the bottom thus the speakers are also more clear and less tinny. The addition of a built-in mic is great to for online play. The memory stick slot also has a major change with it up near the top left side instead of the bottom. The slot is also a piece of plastic that comes out instead of the black corner piece. The slot it hidden well and blends in nicely with the unit.Finally the UMD slot has changed with a pull-out slot instead of a switch that makes it pop out. You just lay the UMD in instead of sliding it in like a cassette tape. It's quieter, and seems to be slightly faster as well, and uses less battery power. Another good change is the WLAN switch is on top of the unit next to the USB port which keeps you from accidentally switching it on. The console feels better when holding due to its glossy back, and there are no contours for your hands, but this makes holding the unit better for some odd reason.Other than that everything is the same. The screen is crisper, brighter, and the new PlayStation home button looks great too. The Wi-Fi is slightly faster, supports newer security, and this unit is just solid and brilliantly designed. I really went back to my old UMD collection just to play the unit more, because games look nicer, and they just feel great being played on a solid piece of hardware.",5,Three times the charm.

Sadly, despite some stellar software -- especially role-playing games -- the system just didn't do as well as it deserved to do. Don't get me wrong, I think Nintendo's handhelds are stellar, but I do believe that the PSP deserved a little more respect. The 3000 features a crisp display, satisfying weight, the ability to connect your PSP to your television, etc. It offers a lot for a very cheap price, and despite being very lightweight, it's actually quite durable. Now, do I recommend you still buy the PSP with the Vita right around that corner? Well, that depends. I bought this last year and I'll keep it merely because the Vita doesn't allow you to play your physical media, only media you downloaded from the Playstation Network. If you don't care about this and you don't mind buying PSP games on the Playstation Network, you may not have a need for a PSP.

A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B001KMRN0M,Winter,3,3,"I can tell you that the PSP is, beyond a doubt, a great handheld console.  It has always had more capabilities than the Nintendo DS because Sony seems to have aimed it more at a multi-media market that predated the iPad and our current generation of tablets.  It is bulkier (and a bit more fragile) than the DS, but the PSP is also aimed at a customer less likely to accidentally cover it in peanut-butter during a lunchtime gaming session.That said, is there really any need for you to be buying a PSP 3000 core system at this date?Really there'd be only one reason:  the disc.  Called UMD"", this miniature version of a DVD-ROM has gone away with the PSP Go.  Sony have said they'd like to have a way to let you carry all your UMD-based games over to the newer PSP models, but they can't really make that happen.  Next year in the United States will see the release of the next generation of PSP, the Vita.  It will also not support the UMD...but then again it'll be fairly more expensive than this PSP 3000 is now.If you already have a lot of UMD games in your library and your PSP is looking pretty beaten up...or if you feel the need to stock up on bargain UMD games and movies (UMD video was enough of a flop that anything released on it sells for next to nothing now), then you'll probably enjoy the PSP 3000 for a while.  You'll still be able to download games onto a Memory Stick from the PlayStation Store (which is what I do the most these days), but at some point you should expect this very fun ride to come to an end.""",5,"In 2011, Is this Still the Best Bet?",2011/11/3 0:00

Red Dead Redemption deserves a 5 stars not only because it falls into a class of its own - ever played a Western RPG on a console? I didn't think so - but because it's stunningly good when it comes to its taking advantage of PS3's capabilities, because of its most innovative story line, its unparalleled humor and the games ability to fully transport the player right in the middle of late 19th century Texas, living inside a Western story plot. But, since it all takes place on a huge open map and because you are in control of your character, just about anything can happen and you almost always have a say in it. So, expect to have A LOT of fun and occasionally to go into the 'wow' mode as you are playing it.The funny thing is that I didn't play the game myself a lot because I'm still hooked into Demon's Souls but I've watched my son playing it and watching him playing was almost indistinguishable from watching a movie, that's how good the PS3 rendition is. Only when I yelled 'shoot him', unlike in a movie, I could see it happen.When you play this game it feels like you are really living someone's real life. You don't always have to stick to the story line. You are allowed to break free of the story line for a while and go back to it when you feel you are ready. Red Dead Redemption holds very many things to do on the side like maybe a few hands of Texas hold 'em in a cantina, South of the border but, beware, there's cheating going on and keep your watch on the game, ignore the senoritas :). So, it will take you a very long time to be bored.Multiplayer holds games that you can play with other people. You can do team death match and many more types of game modes. While in multiplayer you can start a gang and go around and do things around the map. Just about anything goes, from destroying fortresses full of gang members to fighting off waves of wild animals in hunting grounds. If you can somehow get bored of doing that you can saddle up your horse and try to assassinate anyone in multiplayer with you.So, if you are into 'Western', shooters and wide open world RPGs, this game is it and it's having it all: local color, accents, dialogue, shooting action and lots of unexpected thrills but I won't be spoiling anyone's fun by disclosing too much._________________________________Note on language:The 'M' rating is fully earned because the game makes no compromises. Most cowboys didn't complete finishing schools and the game makes them talk like they did in 'real life'. When characters talk it's not just their accent that's authentic. It's not only 4-letter words but also some quite frank talk that most parents would rather not have their kids hear and then ask questions about :).",5,Texas-sized thrills - a 'must have' unless you really hate Westerns,2010/7/17 0:00

The player character is John Marston, a former outlaw now being coerced into hunting his former gang-mates. The game tries to convey a sense of rural desolation - there's a lot of empty space between towns populated by wild animals and the occasional rider or messenger. The environment is sort of a mish-mash of Western stereotypes, including Southwestern deserts, boomtowns, old mines, and jaunts over the border to Mexico.Like most GTA games, ""Red Dead Redemption"" can best be described as an open-world environment with a linear set of missions. In short, you can tool around all you want in the open world segments, but eventually you're going to have to do the missions to move the story along and access new areas. However, unlike GTA (where all you could really do in the open world was mess around), the open world of RDR is a lot more developed and natural. For example, while GTA was a busy city with very few actual events, RDR focuses a lot more on random roadside events - horse thieves, stagecoach robberies, and bandit ambushes. How you participate in these events (by helping the innocent, helping the robbers, or ignoring it entirely) affects your honor rating, the game's version of a standard morality meter.The game has a lot to do besides fighting criminals (or being one). Towns and settlements will inevitably have some games of chance like Poker, Blackjack, or Horseshoes, and you can while away the hours making or losing money. Out in the wilderness, you can hunt and skin animals, then sell their meat and pelts in town for extra cash. Still, the game feels largely objective-oriented. You can buy houses, but only to save in or change outfits in. You can become famous and well-known, but only by doing missions or random events. It feels largely like a world that you can only interact with in the context of furthering your main story goals.The gameplay itself is good. Gunplay is fast and lethal; the player character has regenerating health, but not that much health in total. This means that if you survive an initial few shots and get to cover, you'll probably be okay, but you can't run through hails of bullets or anything. In combat terms, the game's main ""equalizer"" is the Dead-Eye mode. This is a mode that slows down time and, later, allows you to target your shots for a consecutive burst of gunfire. It's neat in theory, but eventually becomes a crutch. You get so much ""juice"" for Dead-Eye mode that it's easier to start and finish every fight in a single use of it than to actually try and fight all the enemies before you. The guns are interesting, but hardly unique. It's the usual layout of pistols, rifles, shotguns, and so on, except that it's Wild West technology instead of modern technology.The game has a multiplayer mode that seems interesting on paper, but isn't that great in actual practice. Essentially, it's a scaled-down MMO version of the main game. Players have access to the whole map, and can join up in posses with other players to hunt outlaws or rob stagecoaches. However, the lack of real interaction rears its ugly head again, because there's only so much you can actually do in the world. The more conventional deathmatch modes are sort of fun, but hardly groundbreaking.Overall, Red Dead Redemption is a reasonably fun game. Still, the forced mission segments were more annoying than fun (especially in plot terms - ""hey, these guys are clearly evil, maybe we should stop working with them before they betray us""). The sandbox makes up for it in a lot of ways, but even that is too limited to be great. However, as Wild West games go, you could do a lot worse.Rating: 7/10.""",4,GTA in the Old West,2010/8/18 0:00
A114TMHW9GRMPB,B001SGZL2W,PM_SuperFreak,2,2,"This is going to sound a bit 'cheesy' but the character development and plot in this game is so incredibly well-done that by the end of the game, you actually care about the characters and what happens! Combine this with an immersive environment and expansive gameplay, you have one of the most entertaining games that has come out in a long, long time! Single-player will easily lat you 25-35 hours depending on how many side missions you accept. Multi-player is so-so but adds to the overall value of this great title! Even if you are not a fan of the Western theme, do NOT miss out on this exceptional game!EDIT 6-24-2010Here is some info on the latest free COOP misson pack available for download from the PS Store. There are 6 missions in call; unfortunately you cannot choose which one you want to play; it loads randomly, which kinda sucks.Ammunition - The Mexican Army has the town of Tesero Azul under siege. You and your comrades are pinned down, caught under heavy artillery fire and enemy reinforcements. Your first goal is to clear the town of all hostiles while avoiding enemy artillery blasts from the ridge. Once completed, the next phase of the mission shifts to clearing out the Eastern and Western fortifications surrounding the town. These areas are rife with snipers, riflemen, and gunners on mounted Gatling guns. Once the flanks are secured the final phase of the mission begins, prompting one of your team members to grab explosives from inside the town and plant them on the high ridge amidst the opposing artillery encampment. The mission concludes once the camp is secure and the explosives detonated.Walton's Gold - Walton's gang has taken control of a small mining camp rich with gold. Fight through the camp while avoiding sniper fire from the ridge and mounted Gatling guns near the entrance to the mine. Once inside, pile as many bags of gold as you can into a mine cart while fighting off waves of Walton's cronies. Be quick, the mine is rigged to explode! Once safely outside the mine, defend your newly acquired riches from Walton's reinforcements.The EscapeInterrupt an arms deal and steal a coach full of gold, with the option of using a second, Gatling gun-equipped wagon for protection. Turn the gold in to the American Army and clear out remaining resistance in the town of Tumbleweed. The battle at Tumbleweed involves cannons and Gatling guns. After a classic double-cross that ends in a stand-off, escape with the Gold Coach to Mexico, battling Army soldiers the entire way.The HerdCattle rustlers have taken control of Box Canyon. Fight your way in and wipe out the rustlers, then use teamwork to protect the herd as you lead them home to Armadillo under heavy fire - watch for snipers on the ridge, and reinforcements on horseback.The Kidnapped GirlAnother gang has taken over Fort Mercer, and they're holding a farmer's daughter hostage. Charge the fort and eliminate the gang's inner stronghold, then fend off reinforcements as you transport the girl by stagecoach to her home at Ridgewood Farm.The RiverUse a raft to head downriver, taking out rebel encampments along the way until you reach the rebel stronghold of Nosalida and a final epic battle for the town's massive weapons caches. Watch out for Gatling gun-equipped enemy rafts.",5,"A deep, immersive experience",2010/6/20 0:00

The game is very dark in its contents so this probably wouldn't be one you would give to young kids but I think young teens should at least get a chance to play it though I'd advise parents to check the contents of the game before you get it though no matter how much your kids beg you for it.  The graphics of the game are astounding not to the point of Uncharted but still very well done, also like previous other Rockstar games you can pretty much do whatever you want though when around town you do have to be careful still. Many of the mini-jobs are also entertaining from riding with a posse to catch a gang of outlaws to helping a ranch owner with some horses or crops and the like,  So for any fans of the Rockstar game series franchise here's another great choice to try out until the next one is released....",5,A Great Video Game Version Of The Good The Bad And The Ugly,2011/12/3 0:00

A1TY4TRLA4QK5Y,B001TORSII,"Brian Long Brian""""",8,5,"Mass Effect 2 is one of those games that defies simple explanation. A massive universe with an in depth storyline, real and entertaining characters, engaging dialogue and sidquests, and a breadth that nothing short of incredible. Basically, something not to be missed.The graphics are gorgeous, though too much is cast in a weird orange glow that swallows almost everything. But the tech nerd will delight in the hologrpahic loading screens, of which there are about 30, the near photorealism of the characters and some long distance visuals.Audio is perfect, with a combination of old and new voices, some so apropo to character they'll make your skin crawl. Major props to Martin Sheen for the Illusive Man. There is however, a lot of overlap when too many opponents occupy the screen. Also, some voices are oddly placed and distorted, so that you'll be listening to a side conversation that seems to be happening from across the room.Gameplay is what you'd expect, but also where the most bizarre developments were made. Almost every story mission, all of which contain critical in game items and upgrades, are one play only. So if you miss something, you'll never know, much less be able to go back and get it. Planets that are explorable are now fewer and farther between, and the system to move from planet to planet, despite working well, is now a odd feeling piloting sim.Health and shields are now totally regenerative, and healing is solely for your squadmates, so there's no longer an ability to heal on the fly, making this more like Gears of War cover to cover combat. Emphasis is now on skills, many of which combine well. XP is radically changed, and no longer dependent on combat. This is rather confusing, and makes leveling hard to visualize, and what gets you experience seems random at time. Skills are also shrunk to 6, removing a fair amount of character customization.Upgrades and improvements replace the majority of new equipment, which has to be researched. Searching for resources is now a annoying mini-game that feels like one of those old school adventure games where you scoured every pixel of every screen to progress. The new hacking and decryption minigames are fairly nice, and easy to get through, meaning tech personnel are no longer mandatory.A fantastic game with only a few features that have backslid from the first chapter, this is still probably the most in-depth, expansive, and beautiful RPG you'll play this year.

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B001TORSII,"Cloud ...""""",3,2,"Mass Effect 2 is one of those strange games for me in that I was really anticipating playing the game yet the first game was a bit of hit-or-miss affair. The world, storytelling and characters were great but I felt the combat and sidequests were really clunky and until near the end, it had a problem with pacing. But like what Ubisoft did with Assassin's Creed 2, they took all the complaints and suggestions from fans and tried to make something that was better than what came before it and so we come down to Mass Effect 2. With promises of a darker storyline and improved gameplay, did they deliver? Boy did they ever since a couple things sour the experience but not enough to completely drag the game down. Even though it's early in the year, I don't think anyone will forget the game come Game of the Year 2010 time, whether or not it wins given the onslaught of sure-to-be great games this year remains to be seen.Story: After the threat involving Saren and Sovereign has been taken care of, the Council and Alliance are not entirely sure that the Reaper threat is still an impending factor and only Shepard, his crew and Captain Anderson seem to believe it's going to happen sometime soon. Also believing the Reaper threat is still tangible is the Illusive Man and his pro-human group Cerberus and he believes this threat is tied into human colonies literally disappearing without a trace and it's up to Shepard, old friends and new allies to take care of this threat however this mission is so dangerous that everyone, including you, might not make it back.Graphics: Many people criticized the graphics in Mass Effect for having less-than-smooth framerates, textures that loaded in eventually (and it does have that weird Unreal Engine flaw that certain textures, especially on faces, seem to shimmer"" which is in this game as well) but the game had great art design but now Mass Effect 2 has been re-tooled and everything about it is more fluid, the graphics and especially facial animation is spot-on, the art design is as beautiful as ever and the combat has a lot more going on without a hitch in framerate. I did notice a couple of bugs though such as teammates taking cover...2 feet off the ground while an enemy NPC was literally standing in mid-air but they weren't that common and considering just the size and the amount of stuff in the game, it makes sense a couple of little technical hitches slipped by.Sound/Music: The games of Bioware, whether or not you liked the gameplay, always have stellar voice acting and here it's no exception (though the male Shepard is slightly flat) but everyone does a great job and Liz Sroka as Tali is still as cute and awkward as ever, even moreso since she's a love interest possibility. The only disappointment is Zaaed, the DLC character since he's got a cool voice but as a character he's really flat and he doesn't really do anything as far as dialogue afterwards. The music is big, operatic, has tinges of electronica/trance music since you can visit a couple nightclubs and there's some eerie, dissonant music as well so I'd recommend tracking down the soundtrack or however you like to get your OST fix.Gameplay: To bring up Assassin's Creed 2 again, the changes and refinements Ubisoft made almost make it difficult to return to the original since whatever was fixed is not there anymore and you find yourself going ""oh right, I can't do that in this one"". From selecting your biotic powers and tech abilities to cover mechanics, Bioware really refined the game and anything you can nearly think of as far as complaints have been taken into account. The sidequests involving the Mako? So far (DLC in future apparently) they're gone replaced by quests where you find artifacts or rid bases of enemy factions. Playing as an adept, it was incredibly fun to direct a squad member to a specific location, have them use Pull to act as a ""come here!"" in my best Scorpion voice then use Warp to send them flying right off the screen all in real-time without pausing the menus is quite awesome and there's literally some enemy encounters that are actually quite intense.And really the word of the day in regards to Mass Effect 2 is ""streamlined"" and in addition to the combat, the way you handle your characters as well have been refined. Inventory management? Gone. If you find a better assault rifle, everybody can use that assault rifle, which comes in handy if you have the pre-order/collector bonuses. Armor upgrades apply to every character though they're not customizable so aside from a character costume change you can do provided you complete their loyalty missions, anything you upgrade will apply to everybody and skills have also been simplified. Remember how in the first game you had to put in a certain amount of points to be better at a certain gun or unlock a better skill? Not here, here everybody has only their tech/biotic abilities and your skill points go in improving them with up to 4 upgrades, the 4th allowing you to choose the type of skill it becomes (example: one upgrade might make you a tougher character whereas the other makes your weapons dish bigger damage). But as far as gameplay is concerned, there's not a lot to nitpick.That is until you come down to the mining and space exploration. See, those upgrades you need for your ship and characters will play a huge role in determining who lives and dies in the endgame (the whole mission is seen as a suicide mission after all) so if you want everyone to live, you got to upgrade everyone to the brink including your ship and how do you do that? By waving your cursor around a planet and firing a probe whenever a spike happens on your meter and it's, well it's tedious. Granted it's not supposed to be fun or you'd be upgraded to the max before you hit the 10 hour mark but still, doesn't have to be this unfun. Also, this is a minor nitpick but there's a character you get in your squad at the end of the game that is so cool yet so late addition that by the time you recruit him, you're literally near the end.For those of you curious, the Collector's edition comes with a neat little artbook as well as a comic which details events that happen inbetween the first game and this game and they involve Liara (who by the way, turned into a real ***** in this game), the Collector armor and rifle where he kind of looks like Guyver but insect-like as well as the making-of/wallpaper disc like in Dragon Age. All in all it's a good edition though I hope the pre-order exclusive armor is put up for sale as well.As far as the game itself, this was definately a surprise since I knew it was highly anticipated and everyone was gonna play it but the first game wasn't completely masterpiece-level but like that ol' assassin's game, sometimes the first game is just a leadup to the better thing and if that's the case, well, Mass Effect 3 already can't get here soon enough.""",5,GOTY contender already?,2010/2/3 0:00
AN81JUYW2SL24,B001TORSII,Gearhead Mania,0,0,"This review is for Mass Effect 2 Xbox 360.I played through Mass Effect 1 on the PC and was disappointed to learn that had I played Mass Effect 1 on the Xbox, I could import my save game and get some nifty bonuses, along with the Long Service Award achievement. In order to get this achievement without importing a ME1 save, one has to play through ME2 twice. I will cut to the chase and say I really liked ME2, but not enough to play through it again immediately and possibly not on the Insanity difficulty (to get yet another achievement). The default actions from ME1 include Wrex dying on Virmire, and the Alliance Council being led by humans with Udina as the ambassador. When I finished ME1 on the PC, Wrex was alive, and the original Council was saved with Anderson being the ambassador.Initially, managing 5 resources gets very tedious as your character can't afford to do research or buy upgrades without resources like credits, element zero, iridium, platinum, and palladium. Once you use probes to obtain these resources on planets (once you get to about 50k for element zero and 150k-200k for the metals, you can stop) it isn't as big of a problem but obtaining upgrades still requires credits. Playing through ME2 once, my character was still about 3000 experience points away from level 30 (which would have yielded another achievement) even though I explored every single planet and completed every side mission I could find. Managing the fuel and probes for the Normandy while exploring star systems was something I would have eliminated. It was unnecessary and didn't add anything to the gaming experience. Once you run out of fuel, EDI uses some palladium to tow your vessel back to the mass relay - not a big loss to be honest.The use of thermal clips is somewhat of a pain because in the later and more difficult stages, you quickly run out of thermal clips. Even with the Revanant Light Machine Gun (which has lots of ammo), I ran out at the final boss and had to finish him off with the pistol. In ME1, your weapon has unlimited ammo and just has a tendency to overheat which requires a cool down period. In ME2, you use thermal clips which in effect is ammunition.The mini-games are an improvement over those of ME1, but they are still tedious and waste time. They net you mostly credits with the occasional upgrade, and are often used to continue the mission (door, computer, etc...) The data hacking and bypass games require matching icons or screenshots.The Hammerhead is gone, and in its place is a shuttle that you can't fly/control. The Firewalker DLC gives you a hovertank, which is easier to control than the ME1 Hammerhead. I hear there is a ME2 DLC that gives you the Hammerhead.There are several DLC that have their own achievements, which makes it impossible to have 100% achievement completion unless you pay for the DLC. Adding up the cost in Microsoft points to purchase these DLC add-ons, it is the same price as the full game and the DLC just add a few side-quests. The Lair of the Shadow Broker has received high ratings, but I am not about to pay that much to find out.I also enjoyed the music soundtrack from ME1, which is sorely lacking in ME2. The ME2 music is typical video game stuff, while ME1 reminded me of the movie Blade Runner. Many of the main planets/stations are significantly smaller than the ones in ME1. For instance, the Citadel is now basically Zakera Ward and Captain Anderson's office in the Presidium! Tuchanka and Illium are major planets, yet your character only gets to visit one tiny portion of each area.Besides the DLC achievements, 2 achievements that require a lot of time/patience to obtain are the long service award (unless you import a ME1 save) and completing the game in insanity difficulty.The voice acting in ME2 is top notch! Martin Sheen is the Illusive Man, Yvonne Strahovski (Agent Sarah Walker from Chuck) is Miranda and Miranda is even modeled to resemble Yvonne, Adam Baldwin (Animal Mother from Full Metal Jacket, Colonel Casey from Chuck) is a Quarian commando leader, Claudia Black (Pitch Black, Farscape), and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity from Matrix) are just a few of the celebrities that lended their voices for the game. I noticed that the Collectors resembled Pilot from Farscape. And yes, I did look up interviews of Yvonne on YouTube to hear her real Australian accent!The controls are intuitive, and the AI isn't too bad. Your squadmates generally obey your orders but sometimes get in the way or enjoy getting killed by disobeying your commands. The loyalty factor in your teams is a good touch but it starts to get confusing when you have such a large team. I liked how a Geth joins your team, and there are more options for relationships in ME2.Pros: Fixed a lot of the issues I had with ME1, intuitive controls, easy inventory and upgrade system, excellent voice actingCons: Too many resources to manage, thermal clips, mini-games are annoying, DLC add-ons are rather expensive and have their own achievements, lack of good music to set the mood, there's no way to port my ME1 PC savegame to ME2 Xbox. I know this is a silly request, but doing a Google search shows a lot of people asking the same thing.Overall: 4/5 stars! If you're into RPG's like Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, but also enjoy Sci-Fi, and  3rd-person shooters, definitely play Mass Effect 1 and 2!",4,"An improvement over Mass Effect 1, you must play this game!",2011/1/9 0:00

It is great to be back - but you might expect a few more improvements than what you get.First, the basics. You are Commander Shepard, a male or female human character, the same person from game 1. You were slain but then resurrected by a group called Cerberus. Once again you build up a team of very unique characters, interacting with them through a variety of dialogue choices, affecting your relationships with them.The graphics are really well done. They have taken it up a notch from Mass Effect 1, and that's saying something. The audio is also well done, getting you to feel the emotions and motivations of the characters. Some of the dialogue is laugh out loud funny.They did make some improvements from the first game. Those incredibly awful slow moving elevators are now gone, and in fact the characters joke about it at times. Also, the ridiculously silly drive all over a planet in search of a spot"" resource gatherings are gone. However, somehow they came up with just as bad of a solution! Now you SPIN a planet (which doesn't make sense, shouldn't you in your spaceship spin AROUND the planet?) and you look for resources. Surely in an advance space-faring universe they would have gotten a computer program to do this with pinpoint accuracy. Why would they have a human watching the graph go up and down? Maybe Mass Effect 3 will finally get this right.Also, as much as I enjoyed Mass Effect 2, when I go back and play Mass Effect 1 the characters there feel so much more enjoyable. I really love some of their unique quirks. Maybe part of it is that Mass Effect 1 was so fresh and new when we played it. It's hard to tell. Mass Effect 2 just doesn't seem to have that same level of connection.Mass Effect 2 does encourage you to replay Mass Effect 1 because you can import your old characters and have an effect on the new game. So it is definitely worth your while to have several different fully built characters in Mass Effect 1 and bring each one in for a pass through Mass Effect 2. This is not a one-shot-and-done game. It's a game you'll want to enjoy over and over again. trying the different paths.I definitely recommend that anyone who plays Mass Effect 2 at least play through some of Mass Effect 1 first, if not all of it. There is a LOT of background provided in Mass Effect 1 which makes the playing of Mass Effect 2 all that more enjoyable.Some quite famous actors are involved here. Martin Sheen, Carrie-Anne Moss, Michael Dorn and others have over 25,000 lines of dialogue. You are really getting a full fledged movie experience.Highly recommended, but give yourself time to play through multiple times and enjoy the ride!""",5,Epic Game,2011/1/1 0:00
ADPEAVHFCNLLC,B001TORSII,Poisoned Blade,4,2,"Mass Effect 2 improves on everything lacking from the Original!!!Story: 10/10The story is told through Hollywood Quality Cinematics, compelling dialogue voice acted by some top quality actors, and beautifully animated cutscenes.  Two years after the first game takes place, quite a bit has happened.  As Commander Shepherd, you must return and rebuild a crew to assist the morally ambiguous organization called Cerberus in their quest to stop an alien race from raiding human colonies and kidnapping the colonists.  You can import your character from Mass Effect 1 and continue with this game.  One of the primary features of this game is the use of Dialogue Trees.  Whenever you talk to another character, you can control what Shepherd says.  These decisions affect the outcome of the story.Gameplay:  8/10The game plays like Gears of War, where you must cover and shoot.  The random die roll hit / miss stuff from the first game is gone and now your guns are more accurate and responsive.  During a firefight, you can pause the game to switch weapons or use your abilities like Warp, Throw, Slam, Incinerate...  Or you can play the firefights in real time by mapping your special abilities to buttons.  The combat has been greatly improved over ME1, but it feels like there's still some room for improvement.  There isn't enough variety in the enemies and the spells.""  It's too easy to just duck, cover, and use biotic powers to throw enemies around the room.  The combat could use a bit more decision making and some more complicated spells or spell combinations.The awkward Mako Range Rover from ME1, does not appear in ME2!!!Instead, you can scan planets for resources.  This is somewhat tedious, but it's fast and the rewards are great.  You basically move a cursor around a planet and when you detect minerals, you press a button to launch a probe and collect them.  These minerals are used to upgrade your weapons.Level Designs:  9/10Most of the Level Designs are great.  They drive the story and put YOU in the action.  The designs are also straightforward so it's almost impossible to get lost in the levels.Graphics:  10/10The Cutscenes are amazing.The Science Fiction Worlds are amazing.The alien races are amazing.The special effects are very good.Mass Effect 2 looks great!Replay Value:  8/10You can import your character from ME1.  You can play as good or evil.  When you finish this game, you can keep your current abilities and explore the galaxy, or start over with your ME2 character.  There are different difficulty modes for greater challenge.  You pretty much have to play this game twice to see everything.  Each play through could take anywhere from 16 - 32 hours, depending on how much you want to explore.Flaws:There is one minor flaw.  The button that you use to skip the line of dialogue is also used to select an option from the dialogue tree.  So, if a character starts talking and you want to skip to the next line of dialogue, sometimes you press the button as the dialogue tree appears and accidentally say the wrong thing, which may affect your quest, reputation, etc...  I'm astonished that Bioware didn't use the B button to skip to the Dialogue Tree, X to skip everything, and A to select.  In the grand scheme of things, this is a minor complaint.Weapon Upgrades:  10/10No more sifting through 400 different guns to find your favorite.  There are basic weaponry that you can upgrade by finding schematics and minerals as you play the game.  It's very simple.  As you and your allies go up in level, you can also unlock new powers.  It's nice and streamlined, allowing you to get back into the action and save the galaxy.Maturity:  MThe violence is mild, there is some harsh language, and some mild sexual situations.  This is a very light M.Overall:  9.5/10If you want to play a Sci-Fi RPG, this is it!  There isn't a better one.If you love Bioware games, buy this now!  It's also much better than Dragon Age.If you like easy shooters and want a game with loads of story, you should also buy it.If you're a fan of RPG's, this is a must buy.Avoid this game if you hated the first Mass Effect.Avoid this game if you want really difficult deep shooting mechanics, too.  The combat here may be a little light for you.If you enjoyed story of Mass Effect 2, check out Oblivion and Fallout 3!""",5,MASS-terpiece!,2010/6/6 0:00
A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B001TORSII,"Richard Baker BinaryMessiah""""",0,0,"The Good: Much needed improvements work well, amazing visuals and audio, superb story, new additions are excellent, great lengthThe Bad: Feels a little too familiar for vets, some redundant elements, no co-op, it endsBioWare have to be some of the most talented beings on the face of the planet because these guys can just pull whole new cultures, religions, and universes out of their ass like it was yesterday's dinner. Mass Effect has a rich amazing universe attached to it with believable races, characters, religion, culture, and it feels like a whole alternate universe that could exist. Mass Effect 2 expands on this for fans of the original (yeah don't play it unless you played the first...seriously). Not only is this just a direct sequel, but all your actions from the original game effect the outcome of this one...amazing. Mass Effect 2 has Command Shepard being remade as a machine almost after the Normandy gets destroyed by Collectors. Cerberus fixes you up for the over 2 years and now you have to rebuild your team, find your previous one, and stop the Collectors from destroying the human race and working with the Reapers.Mass Effect 2 has so many changes that were much needed and the game just feels tighter, more fluent, and action packed. Action is the key word here since a lot of the mundane RPG elements were stripped. To get an idea of what was improved I'll start with squad management. Instead of finding armor for each type of race and maintaining every stat of that armor and the character you no longer manage your teams armor just yours. You also no longer have to go find armor like the original. Armor can be bought from world markets and you equip each piece in your cabin on the Normandy 2. You can even change the color and scheme of the armor as well as your casual clothes. This is great and I love it becasue micromanaging armor in the first game was a real pain.The same goes for weapons. You no longer have to find and add each element to every weapon like ammo types, and add-ons because those are now gone as well. Instead you find weapons during missions or in markets. You can equip them via a loadout and the same goes for your squad.Let's take about the radial menus here. You get three ammo types: Cryo, incinerate, and disruptor. Each can be used for certain enemies. Your powers are activated here too but you can now map them to buttons. When shooting weapons you now longer have a heat guage"" but actual ammo. The weapons draw heat to a ""clip"" which is discharged once it gets too hot. If you run out of these clips your weapons won't fire thus solving that annoying heat meter crap from the first game. This helps the game feel like a solid shooter instead of a game that doesn't know if its an action game or straight RPG.The shooting and fighting in the game is now really solid and you just feel so powerful will all these guns at your disposal. You can upgrade everything (including your ship and this has outcomes during the last mission) by finding research projects while on missions. This solves all the RPG elements from the last game so it feels like a solid shooter. Don't get too upset there are still RPG elements, but they are only in upgrading your team mates and yourself. Instead of upgrading every single element such as each ammo type, every biotic type, this and that you only have about 4-6 traits you upgrade. This includes your main character's ability, biotic or ammo types, and any other special skill. Each one can be upgrading up to level four and after that you get a choice between two special bonus perks. This makes the leveling feel more solid, fluid, and more resourceful.Another great improvment is the galaxy map navigation. No longer are you just a cursor floating around the map, but you actually move your ship. When you are outside solar systems traveling in dead space on the map you use fuel, but the biggest improvement is no more excavating resources via the stupid rover vehicle. In fact all vehicle control has been stripped from the game. Instead you use a scanner on unexplored planets and when the controller vibrates you will see your meter spike over a certain guage. This will be one of the five resources used to upgrade things in the game. While is sounds more repetitive its nice to break up the action of the game and get some down time.If those don't sound like enough of an improvement how about the story? The story is still as epic and emotionally engrossing as the first if not more so. There are a couple of new races added such as the vorcha, drell, and Batarians. There are new characters that you can recruit and they are all as loveable and memorable as the first game. Of course all your old pals return, but what my favorite part about the game, that isn't in any other, is how your original save carries over.If you had a relationship with a previous mate you will see that in the game, savings and killing certain characters in the past will pop up in the sequel reflecting certain outcomes of missions, if you chose the renegade or paragon path reflects off your character with red scars and reddened eyes if your were a bad ass. You truly feel like you were dead for two years and all your choices in your past came back to haunt you. It's a mind trip and is really makes you that much more involved in the story. Every choice you take during dialogs trees effects what you do, and BioWare are masters of this.The only reason why this one scores lower than the original is because most of this has been seen in the original and isn't anything new for vets of Mass Effect. The new additions just keep the score really high, but doesn't give us that new feeling. With improved graphics and the same amazing voice acting Mass Effect 2 will keep fans buys for a good 25-30 hours, but watch what you do because it will effect your outcome in Mass Effect 3.BUYING A NEW COPY: Will grant you access to a free content update that's normally $15 for free. This includes a new character, Zaeed, and two other missions that involve the crash of the Normandy. While this update is not worth $15 buying a new copy makes you feel like you're truly getting your money's worth.""",5,An amazing sequel to one of the best game series,2012/3/28 0:00
A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B001YI0Z2U,"Cloud ...""""",28,24,"Though I consider 2011 technically the start of the new decade, Bayonetta along with Darksiders has been branded the first games of the new decade, the rip-roaring start to what should be a fantastic year yet an unbelievably crowded first 4 months of 2010. Bayonetta, developed by Platinum Games who worked on Viewtiful Joe and Okami, have basically made what people want to describe as the action genre evolved"", the new standards to which the next Devil May Cry or God of War have to live up to. While there's definately some moments that I can legitimately say no game has ever done for, there's other parts where I lament its inclusion or wish something was tweaked so it wasn't a certain way. Essentially the game, unless you're an action-game master, might be a tad too difficult for people with nimble reflexes, good understanding of the combat and some rare instances of almost needing clairvoyance to avoid the ""where'd that come from?"" deaths. For in Bayonetta you have one of the most fluid battle systems to be in a game, you also have trial-by-death moments, a tonally-off storyline and parts that don't give the game any favors. Least we'll get one hell of a sequel though. Possibly.Story: You play as Bayonetta, an Umbran Witch part of a clan that's more or less on the ""bad side"" which wars against the forces of Heaven, or the Lumen Sages. Having been re-awakened after 500 years of being sealed away with no memory, Bayonetta embarks on a quest to discover her past, her connection to a little girl named Cereza and artifacts known as the ""Eyes of the World"". The problem with the game as a whole as far as its story is concerned is that its hard to tell when the game is taking itself seriously and when it's poking fun so the game is either really serious with slapstick thrown in or satire/comedy with odd pathos moments mixed in. Not to mention for some people it might be hard to follow and outside of Bayonetta herself, the characters aren't incredibly likable but like Devil May Cry, story is just an aside to the action.Graphics: Graphically, the game isn't quite a ""holy ****!""-esque stunner but the game is very-well animated with the character animations for moves, certain levels such as Paradiso levels looking flat-out gorgeous while enemy designs, especially bosses, are imposing, weird and screen filling. In fact there's one boss in the game that practically eclipses the final boss of Shadow of the Colossus and that guy was a tower. But then the game does do this weird stylistic thing where cutscenes play out more like animated comic strips with no lip-sync but just a character pose and lines of dialogue which jets around to another frame to present another look at the cutscene. It'll either be cool or just...weird.Sound/Music: Another oddball soundtrack which combines jazz and epic orchestral themes and part of it just doesn't work. While we're a long ways to the awful metal track that permeated through Devil May Cry, at times you'll hear a nicely done orchestral theme and then you run right smack into a jazzy theme and yes, even a J-pop song and unlike some games which usually one J-pop theme with the main type of music throughout, it goes back and forth so much and the music itself might not seem that memorable either. Voice acting also is somewhat stilted and while Bayonetta and the character Jeanne are nicely done, everyone else is kind of ridiculous and the mastermind behind the whole ordeal is so droll in his voice and thanks to a long cutscene, you might be in a snooze before you realize you gotta fight the dude.Gameplay: Bayonetta is similar to Devil May Cry's battle system where a certain command is used to start a move as opposed to say Ninja Gaiden or God of War which was a combination of X/Square and Y/Triangle but here, there's things like ""tap forward twice and Y"" or ""rotate left analog and B"" but what makes Bayonetta work as an action game is just how well it works and God of War 3 does have its work cut out for it because I'll be honest with you, I button mash God of War yet I learn Bayonetta/Devil May Cry systems. One especially useful tactic is Witch Time where if you press RT when you're about to get hit you activate a bullet time for a few seconds which allows you unfettered access to wail on enemies without fear of being attacked though strangely as you progress in the game certain enemies aren't even affected by Witch Time and you just dodge the move regularly. In addition, Bayonetta has guns and unlike DMC's candy shooting pistols, they're nicely useful here and with guns strapped to her feet and held in her hands, that's 4 guns to use on enemies and it's fun to ""breakdance"" and just spin around on the floor and shoot everything in sight. And you can also buy abilities that'll change you into different forms such as the Panther (a fast runner and quick getaway in battle), Crow (a flight-based attacker that flies for a bit) and Bat (click RT when you've just gotten damaged and you turn into a bat, negating that damage though I can never get the timing down). All in all, there's a huge arsenal of moves to use and with a loading screen acting as a training ground with move lists ready to be read and used, it's fairly easy to pick.That being said, Japanese game developers, especially when it comes to action games tend to be, well, a lot more better than the average player and at times it feels like that's how the game was made, a game for experts. Granted there is an easy and very easy mode but for most people, Normal tends to be the default and when you're getting your ass handed to you regularly in normal encounters, bosses that are very cool and inventive but some take way too long (final boss for sure) or quicktime events that come out of nowhere, it might frustrate a few new players and I've beaten Ninja Gaiden 2 on Mentor (well, Sigma 2 I should say, NG2's a mess) and even I was having problems though I suppose practice will make perfect. However, that doesn't excuse certain sections of the game that quite frankly don't work, the out-of-the-blue Quicktime events or the astronomically high prices of the accessories which practically encourage farming or replaying to the Nth degree. Some might enjoy it but I like it when I can afford everything reasonably, not replay a mission 12 times to afford one thing only to find out there's 10 things I gotta purchase.Bayonetta is certainly a better feeling action game all-around though certain issues I have with it will most likely be corrected if they ever do a sequel but as a first game, this thing is top-notch but to avoid mentioning certain problems it has I think would be a mistake but give it a try, it'll either be the best action game all year or one of the better ones that could've been the best.""",4,Kicking off 2010 with style and hair,2010/1/19 0:00
A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B001YI0Z2U,"Richard Baker BinaryMessiah""""",0,0,"The Good: Super sexy protagonist, great fighting system, lots of elements, epic boss fights, beautiful visuals and audio, excellent storyThe Bad: Brutal rating system, extremely frustrating, too few weapons, occasional technical hiccupWhen you think of sexy and video games they usually don't mix. There have been a lot of attempts at using sex to sell video games and while some were successful such as Dead or Alive, BloodRayne, and Tomb Raider some weren't such as Red Ninja, Cy Girls, and Rumble Roses. Where does this put Bayonetta? On top as queen and as one of (if not THE most) stylish, sexy, and witty female protagonists ever created in any media period.Being a good and bad Umbra witch trying to unlock her past. Bayonetta has witty dialog, and a super sexy British accent. I can't describe just how shocking Bayonetta is in terms of design. She is scantily clad in leather with proportionate breasts, has beautifully styled hair, glasses that look good. She just makes your heart throb when you see her, and no other female game character has done that for me. The cinematics in the game are very outlandish, outrageous, and just I can't believe they did that"".The game is developed by the lead designers of Devil May Cry and Resident Evil so if you are  Devil May Cry fan you know what to expect.My last note on the design of Bayonetta's sexiness is just how they incorporate it all into the game play from items to moves to summoning demons. One cut scene I can recall has Bayonetta sweating on a plane, and Luka watches the bead of sweat drip down her breast and drop down right off her nipple. All while the camera is zoomed in on this at a side angle. Necessary? Yes. Why? Because that is just what Bayonetta is all about. Non stop action with sex thrown in.Getting down to game play you fight the good-bad angels from summoning the Creator to merge all three realms: Purgatorio, Paradiso, and the human realm. All these creatures are amazingly designed and there are good 30 or so of them. Bayonetta fights with both her feet and hands. You can equip a normal weapon on her hands and either the shotgun or handguns to  her feet. Using the Y button uses her hands and B is her feet. The combos are deep and almost endless since you can hold buttons down to charge weapons or use X to just use the hand gun. Using Witch Time is a unique element that you must use at all times since time slows down for a few seconds if you evade at the right time and this is key on defeating certain enemies and bosses since some can't be beaten without it. This is also incorporated into puzzles as well, but they usually aren't all that hard to figure out.Unlocking weapons requires you to find pieces of LPs of angel hymns and bringing them back to to Rolin in the Gates of Hell bar. Here you can also buy items, accessories, alternative weapon designs and more. All items (like in Devil May Cry) give you either health, Witch Power, extra life and you get the idea. Each comes in a small and large form and costs a good amount of halos (the game's currency). There are only four different weapons: A whip, sword, guns, and Beowulf type claws. Thankfully you can have two different load outs and switch to them on the fly.Anyways, when you finish a batch of angels you will be scored based on your combo style, time, and damage taken and this affects your overall level score. If anyone is a Devil May Cry fan you will know this scoring system is brutal and impossible to score perfectly on every level. This is also Bayonetta's biggest flaw since a lot of the game is hair tearing, controller throwing, frustration inducing ulcers, especially when it comes to boss fights. There are five different medals you can get. Pure platinum, platinum, gold, silver, and bronze. Pure platinum consists of you getting the biggest combo style and killing all enemies in the shortest amount of time with taking no damage at all. Platinum consists of the same except you can take a little damage and so on and so forth. You are then ranked at the end of the level by these medals plus how many items you used and overall damage taken plus time and combo style. If you do poorly (like I managed) you can get a stone award. Even on normal I did my best and thought I was smokin' but I still managed to get stone awards at the end of every level.On another note the bosses are fun ad out of this world: They are ugly, big, and you just want to kill them. Each one is unique and one even has you riding around on a piece of debris in the ocean fighting a 200 foot sea creature. Epic? Sure it is and every second of the game is. Each boss and each fight consists of a little damage inducing, button mashing mini-game using Bayonetta's demons or torture attacks. For the larger enemies Bayonetta's hair turns into demons, and if you didn't know her clothes are also part of her hair. She goes into a sexy pose and her clothes are striped except hair swirling around her sweet spots and you can pulverize the enemy. Smaller enemies have torture attacks that are gruesome, some times sexy, and satisfying. This can be done by getting your Witch Power meter all the way up, but take a hit and it goes down. There is no magic in the game and you won't even remember since all the elements work well.On a lost note the game play is changed up in almost every level which leads to epic motorcycle riding levels, jumping across cars in traffic, shooting down enemies on a rocket flying through the air, and a whole lot more. There is even an arcade shooter in between levels that earns you points you can use to get items or exchange for halos. The game is chalk full of neat elements that has never been used in any game before (if so it is perfected here). If you want stylish over the top sexy action then look no further than Bayonetta.""",5,"Sexy, fun, and one of my favorite games of all time",2012/3/28 0:00
AN81JUYW2SL24,B001YI0Z2U,Gearhead Mania,0,0,"Bayonetta for Xbox 360I played this game knowing that it received generally positive reviews from players and critics alike. I am familiar with the Devil May Cry series and understand it is a more action oriented third person style game, with some puzzles and combat. Bayonetta doesn't disappoint with the eye candy. The audio and visuals are amazing. Some of the levels are designed in a mundane run of the mill style, but quite a few of them are impressive in scale and design. It is unfortunate the maps are entirely linear.The bosses are often gigantic in scale, and it is easy to just fall into a button mashing frenzy during combat. I tried the more difficult settings, but it didn't add any enjoyment to the game in my experience. Although the visuals were great, the game wasn't mentally challenging. I didn't really feel a sense of accomplishment as I progressed, and the different combos didn't add any depth to the game. I found myself skipping the cutscenes at the end because the dialogue just dragged on and on.Overall, as a game I felt Bayonetta was well designed and had a above-par premise. The visuals are absolutely stunning, the combat was different (to say the least), and was enjoyable at all difficulty levels. However, if you strip away the eye candy it is just more of Devil May Cry.Overall: 4/5 stars, a crowd pleaser of a game, don't expect it to be a thought-provoking or mentally challenging game - set your brain on cruise control and enjoy.",4,Easy to please button masher,2011/8/11 0:00
ADPEAVHFCNLLC,B001YI0Z2U,Poisoned Blade,30,29,"Imagine Devil May Cry 4 or Ninja Gaiden 2 if the main character was a gun-toting, sword wielding, black magic using, stripper-witch.  If that sounds like a good time, then you should love this game.Story:  6/10The weakest part of Bayonetta is the convoluted story.  It tells an epic 500 year long tale about the Umbra Witches, the Lumen Sages, Heaven, Hell, Earth, and magic jewels called the Eyes of the World.  There's enough story here for a Bioware RPG, downloadable content, and a costly expansion.  Unfortunately, there are only six main characters and it feels like there are three too many.  Basically, the gods are control freaks and Bayonetta tries to save the world by battling angelic warriors.  What saves the story is that Bayonetta doesn't really take anything seriously, she just cracks jokes, struts around like a fashion model, pole dances, and kills things by the hundreds.  Although the entire universe is in danger, Bayonetta still manages to have fun the entire time.  In one scene, the main characters are in a plane that is about to crash.  A dramatic sound effect plays, Dun Dun"" and they zoom in on Luka, who looks terrified.  ""Dun Dun"" and they zoom in on a little girl, clinging desperately to her stuffed animal.  ""Dun Dun"" they zoom in on Bayonetta's cleavage! But, if the lack of story bothers you, you'd be the kind of person who'd bring a book to a strip club and complain that it's too dark to read.Characters:  9/10Bayonetta, Jeanne, and Cereza are great, others are forgettable.Bayonetta is an instant videogame icon.  She's beautiful, powerful, sexy, intelligent, fun, and extremely entertaining.  Clad in an outfit made of gold chains and magical hair, she looks and moves like a stripper.  Her hair is the source of her power; as she performs long combination attacks or powerful magic spells, her hair disappears from her outfit and attacks the enemies, leaving her wearing next to nothing.  After she completes these attacks, her outfit rematerializes.  Her accessories are great, from her black cat earrings, her butterfly glasses, and her high heels made of magical automatic weapons that never run out of bullets.  Bayonetta's primary attacks involve acrobatics, guns, martial arts, magic, and bladed weapons.  She can acrobatically jump 30 feet into the air, perform a 20 hit sword combo, and shoot 10 enemies with the guns on her feet before she lands.  If that's not enough, Bayonetta also shapeshifts into a flock of ravens or a black panther complete with blood red nail polish.  Her dialogue and voice acting are outstanding.  Everything about her screams the perfect hostess for a good time.Jeanne is a rival witch who appears in the game as an ally and a boss character.  She shares many of the same attributes as Bayonetta.Cereza is THE CUTEST little girl to every appear in a game... EVER!The rest of the characters provide some comic relief and are a mixed bag.Gameplay:  10/10Bayonetta's gameplay is amazing!  Because she attacks with her hands, feet, magic hair, swords, blades, gun heels, spells, etc... She has the most potential to be the deadliest video game character of all time.  She's up there with Kratos from God of War.The game relies on a combo system based on pressing the hand, foot, jump, and shoot buttons.  Anyone can easily pull off impressive looking 20 hit combos.  Many of the combos can be linked together to perform 40 or 60 hit combos if you have some skill.  There is no block, just an evade button.  If you evade just before an attack hits you, the game slows down for a few seconds, allowing you to counterattack enemies.  Bayonetta's enemies are ruthless and complement her attack styles.  Most action games have cookie-cutter throwaway enemies that perform simple attacks.  You can tell, that a lot of effort was made to suit the enemies to Bayonetta's fighting style from the minions to the gigantic bosses.  This results in GREAT FUN!You can upgrade Bayonetta with more weapons, spells, items, attacks, etc...  There are enough upgrades in the game to warrant three playthroughs if you want to collect `em all.When some enemies are killed, Bayonetta can wield their weapons as well.  Polearms, massive swords, bows, axes, demonic claws, etc...As you play through the levels, you collect potion components, and halos that you can use to create or buy items.  There are temporary power ups, like health, limited invincibility, magic, improved damage, that come in the form of suckers... because Bayonetta likes to suck on things.  It sure beats the typical ""stepping on a first aid kit"" that old shooters used to have.  You can also buy items that boost Bayonetta's Max Health, or Max Magic.  So, if part of the game is too difficult, you are free to replay an easier level and ""farm it"" for halos.  Bayonetta can also buy more outfits, weapons, spells, attack moves, etc...Level Designs:  9/10The levels are amazing set pieces to showcase the action.  There are destructible areas, hidden spell components, halos, power-ups...  The art style is similar to Devil May Cry.  The levels are linear and it's almost impossible to get lost.  Aside from the action levels, there are also, driving, shooting, and flying levels as well.  At the end of each level, you get a grade and a bonus based on your time, combo points, and damage that you took.  You're free to replay levels if you want to get a better award.Bayonetta can also ""Witch Walk.""  This allows her to run on walls and ceilings, which makes some of the levels even more dynamic and over the top.  In one level, a city floods with lava and you run on the sides of buildings while performing acrobatics and fighting angels.Reward Systems:  8/10Bayonetta's rewards are great, but this system would have worked much better in an open ended game like GTA, Red Faction, Fallout 3...  At times, you may want to farm levels to collect money for an upgrade.  This really encourages you to break the game's story continuity and replay levels while skipping cutscenes.  It's a minor gripe because the upgrades and reward systems are very well done.Replay Value: 7/10If you like action games, the combat system, weapons, and reward system are good enough to play over and over and over.  Playing through on Normal Mode is just short of 10 hours.  Bayonetta's combat system is so deep, it warrants 18 levels and 5 difficulty settings.  You can keep playing to unlock new weapons, techniques, outfits, and compete on the Xbox Live Leaderboards.Sound:  8/10Some of the music tracks are epic and fun, while a few others don't quite fit.  Most of the voice acting is great!  The explosions, demonic sounds, gunfire, collapsing buildings... all punctuate the action.Maturity:  MThe game is sexy and suggestive, but there aren't any sex scenes.  Instead the game is playful and fun.  There are loads of gore and some harsh language.  This is for late teens and adults.Overall: 9.5/10Bayonetta's character design, combat system, and determination to make the player have a great time, make it a strong contender for Action Game of the Year.  It's one of the most entertaining games beat-em up games that I've ever played.Buy this game if you like great action games like Devil May Cry, Ninja Gaiden, or God of War.Rent it if you have 10-12 hours, love AAA Action Titles, and have commitment issues.Avoid it if you hate fun.""",5,Stylish Super Sexy Action Game of the Year Nominee!,2010/8/26 0:00

This game offers some of the most delightful gameplay and visuals that you'll ever experience in a game. Coming from the brilliant minds behind such games as Devil May Cry, P.N.03, Okami, and more, you're in store for yet another masterpiece. Hideki Kamiya, the creator of Devil May Cry, has officially buried old Dante with this beautiful witch vixen by the name of Bayonetta.Bayonetta's gameplay is hands down the best in the genre. The framerate--at least on the Xbox 360 version--is buttery smooth. The combat is deep, engaging, and totally rewarding. Not only can you chain such incredible moves, but there's just so much nuanced depth to the combat system; you'll constantly be learning new things when playing Bayonetta. I have never experienced such elegance in a combat system. I've played them all, including Ninja Gaiden, Devil May Cry, God of War, etc., and Bayonetta takes the cake and eats it all up. This one's that darn good.The graphics are colorful, crisp, and overall just very pleasing to the eyes. The levels can be really imaginative and detailed. Bosses are huge and animate wonderfully. Bayonetta also animates beautifully as she's pulling off a ton of cool moves to take out her foes. It all looks and performs admirably on the Xbox 360 hardware.The story is 100% insane. Not only is it cheesy, but it's also heartwarming at moments. There's some really likable characters on display in Bayonetta.

ADLVFFE4VBT8,B002AB7TX8,"A. Dent Aragorn""""",7,7,"INTRODUCTION - SETTING THE MOODHey, I apologize in advance for the super-long review but this is an immense game so maybe it deserves a long review. I'll see if I can abbreviate it a little but I'm afraid it will stay 'long' no matter what I do.Hmmm... I worked so hard to bring my beloved Uchigatana to a +6 but now Ben, Bladwin's brother - they are both blacksmiths - suggests that I give it to him and he's going to make a Crescent Uchigatana +1 out of it. A PLUS ONE out of my +6? Yes, my kids advise, go for it. While it's true that the Plus One Crescent does only 75 damage vs. my +6's 153, my current level of magic 35 should add at least 92 points of magic attack to the physical damage and, with the help of a few dozen Darkmoon stones (lots of Grim Reapers had to die for me to harvest them) and less than 10,000 souls (a bargain) I can immediately upgrade it to Crescent +3 and with THAT weapon, my friends, it only takes one quick slash to dispose of a silver skeleton and I can do away more than half a dozen low-level zombies with one swing. And, did I mention that it will slowly restore my MP (magic points) while I'm wearing it so I don't really need to keep the Fragrant Ring on and I could use the Sharp Magic ring instead to further boosts my magic strengths including Uchigatana's power but, true, it WILL lower my magic defenses. Or use the Thieves' Ring while in Queen's Tower prison so that the lovely bell-ringing octopus-head prison guards (good looking girls with a passion for electrocuting and stabbing while hugging you tight) won't notice me. And the Thieves' Ring seems to do well with those giant flying stingrays. They do notice me eventually but it makes them less vigilant so there are fewer of those 15-foot long, self-homing spikes they keep shooting at me when they get angry or suspicious.Did I say too much? Then, let me say this. Granted, I'm a slow player because I really like to enjoy my games so maybe this is not typical but, after almost 100 hours of play, I'm probably 20-30% into the FIRST round of playing. It's true - after you finish the game, you get to play it again as it gets even harder.BRIEFLYDemon's Souls is, in my view, one of the best fantasy RPGs that ever came to a game console. If you don't mind stabbing, slashing, shooting, cleaving, crushing, tearing, punching, scratching, infecting, slicing, burning or poisoning your enemies (and have the same thing done to you) and watching them die as they bleed, scream, decompose and sometimes howl  in agony or even beg for mercy. And you'll be facing several classes of zombies, gargoyles, giant flying stingrays, knights in shining or all-black armors swinging what you could safely call 'weapons of mass destrctions' in the shape of ten-foot long meat cleavers at you, leeches, rats, blobs with shields on top of them, daemons of all shapes an sizes, grim rippers, octopus-headed ladies, immensely powerful fire-breathing dragons, giant steel spiders, huge worms with human faces.Coming from someone who's played the Ultima series way back in the 80's and who's still waiting for the next in the Scrolls of the Elders, having enjoyed Oblivion more than any other console RPG, saying that Demon's Souls is 'awesome' should mean something. But, I was trying to briefly describe the game so, here it is, the story line in a paragraph, as dark and impossibly complicated as it could possibly come out of Japan. A king attempts to keep his kingdom - Boletaria - prosperous by means of some dark rituals involving the consumption of souls which, eventually, awakens the Old One, a great demon whose awakening unleashes lesser but still immensely powerful demons who quickly begin feasting on the regular people souls themselves while the kingdom is enveloped by a mysterious fog, isolating it from the rest of the world. None but one who went into the fog ever returned and that one told the story - everyone in Boletaria is now insane and, unless someone does something, the fog is likely to spread and envelop the entire world. And that's where you, the player, get involved so your mission is to talk the Old One into going back to sleep and maybe save the world.MY EVALUATIONIt's strange how a game that's so unforgiving and that requires you to fight so many battles again and again until you achieve perfection - only to have to fight them some more - can become so addictive and almost obsessively so. There are three gamers in our family and not only do we wait for our turns but we watch each other playing, share 'funny stories' and tips involving gameplay and lose a lot of sleep when we can afford it and sometimes when we can't. It's probably illogical but, having to fight the same battles many times is not only immersive but it's actually fun and rewarding. On the third or fourth try you know exactly how to defeat the Grim Reaper and you know each individual Gargoyle's style and capabilities and you can play each battle in many different ways by slightly changing your tactics and strategies and the weapons you use until you achieve the perfect stab or slash or cast your spell at the time and place needed for it to hit the mark and to maximum damage. The only thing... before you get to the Grim Reaper you must first annihilate a few dozen other enemies, every single time.And did I mention that that worlds of Boletaria are simply Awesome? Exploration and discovery are a joy in this game only balanced by the overwhelming sense of fear, dread and desolation oozing out of it. Most of your enemies don't only die when you dispose of them, but they go screaming, screeching or howling. Their bodies bleed and, through the controller, you can almost feel the the flesh tearing apart or stabbed by your blade or their armor breaking into pieces.Being so hard to master - but not impossible because I won't consider myself a great player - there is a great sense of accomplishment every time a new boss is defeated, a weapon is upgraded and tried out in the field or a new location is conquered.I can't give too much praise to the online play elements. You are NEVER alone in Demon's Souls. Other players can watch you and you can see their ghostly outlines as they play. You can leave messages to warn others of dangers and... you can see how they die or sometimes commit suicide. You can help others and sometimes you must defend yourself from those attempting to invade your world and destroy you. And all is smooth and so well integrated into the game's atmosphere that, in the rare occasions when our PS3 loses its network, all seems disturbingly quiet and lonely.While nothing is perfect and nothing can be perfect and without having finished the game yet, I would say that Demon's Souls is without a doubt a top RPG for the PS3 platform.GAMESPACEYou act in 5 'worlds' or locations:  the Boletarian Palace, the Stonefang Tunnel, the Tower of Latria, the Shrine of Storms and the Valley of Defilement and you can cross from one world into another via the Nexus, a safe space, to the extent that anything built on top of the Old One can be safe, where you do most housekeeping chores. You can move relatively freely inside each world to the extent that you don't mind fighting... everybody all the time and there are gates that take you farther (usually deeper) into the worlds IF you manage to defeat the bosses guarding them.Along the way, and usually following a fight, you find weapons and armor or items that may help you upgrade your weapons or armor and you decide how to manage your possessions but the main currency in the worlds of Boletaria is now 'souls'. Everyone is after them and the only way you can survive is to get them, usually by killing your opponents and to spend them on things that you need.But this is only scratching the surface. Your eventual goal is to calm down the Old One by defeating and killing the demons that feed him souls and, as expected, this is not exactly a walk in the woods. How about a walk in swamps infested by some of the most foul and poisonous and or disease spreading critters you could never imagine? Or exploring deep and dark tunnels where ghosts and Grim Reapers live, or some immense prison where all have lost their minds and the warden ladies wear tentacles on their heads? Or a mine where... you guessed it right, everyone is insane and they keep acting as if they were working but they will always take a break so that they can chase you around, throw some fireballs at you or drop boulders the size of trucks on you? And if you think that the 'surface' is safer, think huge dragons capable of completely incinerating your with one casual sneeze, or armored and well-armed skeletons always in a bad mood.GAMEPLAYAfter you create your character - name, gender, class, looks - you start with very little but, as you gather souls, you pay the blind lady who doesn't look like much but almost everything here is deceiving and she will raise your soul level, allowing you to improve on ability: vitality, endurance, strength, intelligence, magic, faith, dexterity, luck and you will need these abilities to be able to cast spells use certain weapons and generally survive in a world in which there are very few you could call 'friends'.You progress by improving yourself and your weapons and defeating the various bosses. Doing so is important because the bosses block access to areas where... the next boss can be found.Once you get killed, something that happens often, you lose the souls that you accumulated and wake up in the Nexus in 'soul form'. And there are ways to regain your body, usually by defeating a boss or... HELPING someone else defeat a boss but acting in human form must be a well-thought decisions. You do have more 'health points' as a 'body' but you are also weaker and while in a body form your world is open to invasion from other players out there. They can show up and kill you and, every time you die (or when you do bad things) the world you died in turns a little 'darker'. And the darker the world, the tougher your opponents become and... you are more likely to find 'good stuff'.While in 'soul' form, you can volunteer to help other players defeat bosses or simply ride along with them. The reward is that you are revived in body form if, when summoned, you help the other player defeat a boss or maybe defeat an invader who teleported into his world to kill him.Now, just to make it all a lot more fun, while you are online, the makers of Demon's Souls have the ability to control the so-called 'world tendency' in each of the five worlds, independently of your own actions so a pure-white world may suddenly turn darker and more dangerous or vice-versa.And this is not all. While playing, you can see the 'blood stains' of the heroes who died on that particular spot. You touch it and you see the last seconds that preceded that hero's death. And you can leave messages to warn others and, you can see in real time, the ghostly images of other players fighting monsters or just running around as you are minding your own business.And, of course, every time you leave a world for the safety of the Nexus, ALMOST everything other than the bosses and some of the NPCs resets and respawns. So you will be fighting the same battles over and over and over again, using different tactocs, improving your skills until you approach perfection and achieve elegance.And... how about whole the game resetting itself? It's true, or so I heard that, after you complete the game you can retain some of your hard-earned possessions and skills and go for an 'encore' but a bit harder this time.THE PAIN FACTORThis is one of the most brutal and unforgiving games I've ever played. And I'm not talking about the slaying of zombies or slimy creatures at almost every turn and having to do it repeatedly. Demon's Souls is unforgiving to the player because nothing but complete dedication and near-perfection would do.The tutorial is probably the threshold that's the hardest to cross. You start weak and almost unarmed and you mission is not only to survive - which, if you are successful, you won't - but also to defeat a mysterious monster that's almost nothing but slime, near-impenetrable armor and dozens of extra-long spears and do it in near-complete darkness. Saying that it's frustrating it's an understatement. I would have given up if it weren't for my kids who won their first victory before I did and motivated me to continue.And the hardship continues and only grows after that. Unlike most other games, you can't just save once you defeat an opponent and establish a safe point to restart from. You are in that world until you are killed and lose your hard-earned souls or you return to the Nexus on your own but, remember, every time you come back from the Nexus, all the monsters you killed except for the bosses are there challenging you again and you have to kill them again. But, not everything resets itself completely. Usually 'the good stuff' only presents to you once or twice, IF you are lucky but the bad guys are always there to challenge you again and, if the world turns dark on you, to maybe slice you and dice you a few times before you develop some new and better tactics to defeat them for the 100th time again.VIOLENCEI believe I mentioned this all throughout my review but maybe the level of violence merits its own heading. There is A LOT of it in this game and all of it is graphic. I believe there is a setting that would hide 'bleeding' but with or without that, there was a reason it was rated 'M' as in 'mature'. So, anyone who doesn't feel comfortable about killing tens of thousands of soulless, computer generated creatures, don't buy this game.TECHNICAL MERITDemon's Souls was made for the PS3 exclusively and it shows. The graphics and animations are simply breathtaking and, unlike the multi-platform Oblivion where 'fire' and 'smoke' could only be done at the expense of slowing everything to a crawl and the objects in the the distance became usually blurred, the world of Demon's Souls is almost always crisp and responsive visually, it rarely skips a frame and it never slows down, even when dozens of characters are present and moving independently on the screen.Add to the above some of the most realistic sound effects and 'break and shatter' graphics, with the audio-visual experience enhanced by the controller perfectly synchronize vibrations that allow you to 'feel' the blows as your shield blocks them.Unlike many other RPG worlds where a lot of the landscape and the dungeons are cookie-cutter reassemblies of a limited number of elements, the world of Boletaria appears to be fully, uniquely custom-designed. Very little repeats and every new location you discover is different and usually surprisingly different from anything else in the game.FIVE STARSOn a 1-100 scale, I would rate Demon's Souls as a 95+. The game is remarkably bug free and the instances where characters do silly things because they can't climb a boulder or can't make a turn are rare enough for the game to stay immersive. I already know that I'll be spending more hours on Demon's Souls than on any other PS3 RPG or any other type of games I own so far.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;",5,A Fantasy RPG Dream Come True - seriously,2010/5/19 0:00
A1TY4TRLA4QK5Y,B002AB7TX8,"Brian Long Brian""""",2,1,"Demon's Souls follows in the footsteps of King's Field, and for those of you who winced in angered memory, its vastly improved. You are a mute, essentially nameless and faceless warrior of a particular stripe sent into the Deep Fog or help rescue an imperiled kingdom from the demons that now infest it. While power and glory may be motivation, unless the Fog is repulsed, it will swallow the world.The graphics are very pretty, and flow very well, so you're not caught feeling liked you've switched universes as you change rooms, but the various worlds are eerie, unsettling things that will make your skin crawl at times as you explore torture chambers in a prison filled with armed psychotics, run across ramparts pursued by gigantic dragons, and face 30 foot tall demons with weapons reminiscent of shadow of the colossus. Monster repeat rather lamely at times, but they are varied and well put together.The gameplay in this is virtually realistic. And by realistic, I mean full of mistakes, and utterly without mercy. Four or five blows from a peon can easily kill you, and while you're tougher than the average bear, its hard to fight with weapons in a cramped corridor, meaning your frequently hitting walls and other obstacles rather than your enemy. A lock on feature and fairly good combat mechanics help make up for this, but unfortunately, the sheer brutality of the game will frustrate many, though a shot of reality in the midst of nigh invincible super men is at least a welcome departure, but this makes up for it almost too well.Annoyances that still haven't been fixed despite this effectively being Kings Field VIII abound. There's very little, almost zero, interaction, apart from some yes/no dialogue options. Some items, such as levers, are interactive, though these are not easily or clearly identified, despite items being made glowing orbs of light or a bright shine. Its too easy to get lost, and there's no map. Level 80 monsters can be found next to level 8 ones, meaning there's lots of surprise deaths.Overall though, this game is entertaining, well storied, and contains some nice and almost unique developments. The interactivity and hints dropped by other players are nice, and the Black Phantoms, where you can break into another players game and try to kill them are sweet. The ghosts that crop up periodically are spooky and still manage to be helpful at times. It is very difficult, yes, but so long as you fight smarter and not harder, its only a 7 as opposed to a 9 as many say.",4,"Get ready to die, and die, and die.

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B002AB7TX8,"Cloud ...""""",4,3,"You know that situation in RPG's where you've levelled up some characters, gained some good stuff and maybe even that rare drop only you forgot to save after all that hard work? Know how disappointing and almost crushing it is to lose all that progress? If the memory still stings, then Demon's Souls is going to become your new archnemesis. When people say a game is challenging, it's usually just that they die too many times or they never really understood how to play"" the game. Demon's Souls on the other hand is never cheap or unfair but it is punishing. It's a perfect description because this game in a sense doesn't tolerate errors or ""oops"" moments, it takes advantage of them and more often than not your deaths will come from those moments where you decided to be a little foolhardy. There's a couple of things that seemingly make it more difficult just for the sake of it but all in all this is the kind of game that if you're in the right mood, the game will enter your mind and sort of linger; thinking about playing, thinking about what you want to accomplish next time you play. Sure you'll swear but you'll probably love every moment of it too, you masochist.Story: The story takes place in the kingdom of Boletaria as the old King Allant the XII ended up unleashing the Old One, a powerful beast which covered the land in a thick fog which brought with it terrifying demons who crave souls. Many have tried to defeat these demons but none of ever managed to be successful. The game starts appropriately enough with your death (get used to it) who is sent to the Nexus, where you can enter portals to various lands around the kingdom and hopefully bring down the demons one at a time.Graphics: Games such as Metroid Prime or a lot of horror games succeed in drawing players into the game thanks to the atmosphere of the game and Demon's Souls is no different. When a dragon swoops down and spouts flames onto the walkway you've just outrun, it's very easy to feel that your in this place. They also are nicely varied as well from a simple castle fortress to a mine and a creepy-as-hell prison. In-game graphics are generally simple with some nice physics effects on things that can be destroyed/blown up and some bosses are just massive and very intimitading. However while NPC models look good, it suffers from the problem of most games with a character creator which is it's very hard to make someone look like they're not a troll.Sound/Music: The music is appropriately creepy at times and almost melancholy. The soundtrack cd that came with pre-orders is a nice listen if you're into music that's not uplifting and high-spirited. Voice acting is generally good though you might not like its...flatness if you will where the actors just don't sound so excited but then again there's no bad line readings from what I've seen or anything where you let out a chuckle but would've been nice for actors to put a little oomph. Sound effects are generally alright and that ""whoosh"" that comes with a successful parry attack called a riposte is flat-out awesome.Gameplay: It's hard to describe Demon's Souls since it feels like something you've played before yet you couldn't think of it if you tried. Essentially imagine the 3rd person swordplay of Oblivion, world traversing of Zelda and RPG elements of pretty much every one you've tried in the past 10 years. You have your lock-on, attack with R1, strong attack with R2, block with L1 and parry with L2. Do a successful parry and R1 and your character will do a badass attack that'll practically kill your enemy in one hit but the timing is incredibly tricky but it's oh-so-satisfying when you pull it off. You also have magic and spells as well as bows and crossbows which feel a bit strange to use since crossbows have no aiming feature like the bow and switching from bow to sword felt strangely cumbersome to me. And you're going to need to learn how to fight because these enemies are not necessarily smart AI-wise but in groups and particularly if you're not careful they can pack a mean punch. Death in this game means that you have to make it back to way you died and activate your ""bloodstain"" where you'll regain all the souls (your currency, EXP to level up) you've accumulated. The brutal thing is that if you died trying to get back to your body, your souls are forever lost and practically negating all the hardwork you did. Yeah, this game wants to make you yell, it seems.Worse is that the game actually gets more difficult the more you die thanks to the concept of White and Black World Tendency which can alter who shows up in what world and what weapons now where it feels backwards to me is that sometimes the best stuff to get is actually in Black Tendency worlds so having the game purposefully get more difficult only to net you some good gear/trophies is odd. In addition, some may not like the idea of no save points or checkpoints and you can't pause in-game either so if you need to answer the phone you need to find a safe hiding place where you know enemies won't come. The nice thing is that enemies don't respawn (they do if you die or re-enter the world though) and other enemies won't come looking for you until they see you. Make no mistake, you need to be absolutely patient with this game because the more time you put into it, the better you'll get and the more satisfaction will come when you finally kill that annoying boss. Downside of course is that there's no place to ""stockpile"" your souls in that you pretty much have to spend or luck out and don't lose any souls since you can't deposit them anywhere save for your level gaining (stat based, not level based) or buying stuff so it's almost encouraged you keep as much as you can till you can spend all of them. No need to be penny-pinching.The most unique aspect of this is the multiplayer which isn't multiplayer per se but more like MMO's without the MMO. Basically practically everyone is in the same level as you and you can even catch glimpses of them via white ghost representations. They can leave messages on the ground to warn you about a valuable goodie ahead or a trap/ambush and even clues as to how to best a boss or enemy. One negative I have of this is that you can't actually spell what you want (obviously to dissuade people using swear words and racial slurs) but say you want to warn people about the dragons in 1-2 and to run to the other tower AFTER they've swooped down and already scorched the walkway. You can't, all you can really say is ""Run right through"" or variations thereof. Bloodstains are also on the ground which'll replay that player's death so if there's a trap ahead and you're not sure how to avoid it, touching the stain will allow you to see how they died and how best to avoid it. In addition, people can come into your world for co-op in case a boss is really laying a beating on you and people can actually invade your world in hopes of killing you and gaining their body back (you can alternate between Body Form and Soul Form). It's certainly unique and I can honestly say I've never seen this before so people, you know those ""Please recommend this"" messages? Please do as you get full health wherever you are and you never know when some player needs a big health boost. Think of it this way, we're all here to beat the thing called Demon's Souls together, not individually...if that makes sense.I got the Deluxe edition though the review is for the regular version since most people probably didn't buy it or preorder but as far as goodies you get a nice embossed cover and an official guide from Atlus with tips, walkthroughs, bestiaries, item and equipment stats and boss strategies. While for some people it might be seen as spoiling the fun but with a game like Demon's Souls, everything as far as help is concerned should be welcomed. Also there was an artbook and a soundtrack cd that came with which is quite nice though it was more character art than concept art a la Prince of Persia, Fallout 3 or Resistance 2's artbooks but oh well.Is this game for everyone? Definately not. The difficulty will be the key factor in determing whether this game is right for you but unlike most difficult games like Ninja Gaiden where the difficulty comes from balanced to completely unfair, Demon's Souls is just a wild beast that'll take awhile to tame. A long while.""",5,Believe me when I say be prepared,2009/10/10 0:00
A2GBBDNZLYC4A9,B002AB7TX8,"Jeff Johnson Jeff Johnson""""",1,1,"This is a great, yet time consuming action RPG with a unique foreboding atmosphere, great ambiance and killer line up of bosses. Its very immerse and makes you want to stay in the game longer and longer.The battle mechanics are where this game shines. You have block, attack, parry (which seems to be useless), roll / dodge (shares a button with run), use item, menu and so on. You pretty much go into every battle holding the block. Let the enemy attack and then its your turn. Its really just as simple as that. You have a stamina bar that wears down when you run, block or attack. if your stamina is too low, an enemy can easily break through your block and then attack and kill you. This is pretty much every battle. It is time consuming. There greater foes that might challenge you with dodges and waiting for the right moment to attack or getting behind them to backstab them. These are more interesting and challenging. Like a heavy knight that will use potions quicker than you and raise his shield quicker than you. The bosses are an absolute highlight of the game if not just a good excuse to kill you.You can't really breeze through enemies. Nor can you run through them as you can in other games. Eventually you'll get blocked or run out of stamina and have a mob of foes ready to kill you. Every attack, block, counter and item use seems to take too long of a time, which leaves you open for any number of things. When your weapons clang against a wall you take damage, which I guess makes sense.Its not hard, difficult or challenging as people say it is. It is just time consuming. The game does a good job of spoon feeding you things in the tutorial level. At the end of the level, they have a boss that is designed to kill you and oh trust me, the bosses will kill you. See nothing else is really that challenging, but the bosses will just kill you. Once the first boss kills you, then you're thrown into the reality of the game that you're a soul that collects other souls as currency. If you just used all of your items on the boss, you need to buy them again with no currency. Then your weapon breaks so you need even more currency and if you spend 45 minutes getting 2/3rds the currency you need to buy a replacement weapon then you die, well that's 45 minutes you just wasted. There are of course blacksmiths that will repair your weapons at about 1/5th the cost to buy a new one.As a 'soul' in a body, that leads into the game's uh multiplayer online yet single player mentality. The game is really single player, but you can see ghosts of other players. You can see blood spots from where they died and you can see a ghost of how they died. This will warn you if you want the warning. This is totally by choice that you can see it. You can also leave messages and read other messages left by other people. They can even tip you for your message whether its a hint, tip, warning or trick. There are plenty of people warning you of simple things and plenty more people trying to get you to recommend a message so they'll get tipped souls in return. Seems more like people trying to get out of the grinding.Since this is an RPG there is plenty of reason to come back to this game after you beat it. You start each game by picking a class and your stats, movement and weapon skills vary, which can drastically alter your game experience. Such as I see plenty of dead spots with ghosts of archers and pikemen. Every weapon has its own rythem too. Quick blades you go stab stab stab once you find an opening, while larger blades are too slow, but effectively 1 swipe is worth 3 dagger stabs. Also with stabbing weapons you need to lock onto a target by pushing the left thumbstick. Otherwise, without locking on... you'll be lucky to hit something.It is rare that I will actually play a game for hours and sink time into a game, but Demon Souls was able to get hours and hours out of me. I feel very committed to the game, because every action is so time consuming and yet rewarding. You get further being cautious than you ever will being quick about things. Your being cautious will keep you alive and keeping you alive will keep you playing.Now for the few downsides. Let's start with the poor camera controls that prevent you from looking into a doorway when a first person perspective would let you see everything. Also, even with all of the warnings, you really need to stock up for bosses or use trial and error methods against the bosses. The only catch is that if you die on a boss... you restart the level. All of the enemies are there again and you lose all of your souls (currency). You still keep your items, you just need to slog your way through everything. That's your punishment for failure. Sure there are unlockable gates as a sort of shortcut through the levels, but if the boss is at the beginning of a level and you need fire to beat that boss, but the merchant is all the way at the back of a level, that just means you'll be playing for 30 more minutes before you face the boss again.So be prepared to pour hours, days and weeks into this game. Every time you pick up the controller it turns into a commitment that is rewarded and punished for failure.Currently its free for Play Station Plus members. It is well worth your time to give it a try if not pick it up for $20.",5,A time consuming joy to play,2013/4/3 0:00
A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B002AB7TX8,"Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...""",2,2,"An action-RPG that prides itself on its difficulty, Demon's Souls is not a game for the faint-hearted. However, for a player willing to overcome a few hardships, Demon's Souls is a well-made, well-executed, highly enjoyable game.Demon's Souls' basic gameplay is hack-and-slash similar to The Legend of Zelda or Kingdom Hearts, i.e. you swing your sword, block with your shield, roll, dodge, and so on. However, Demon's Souls has much higher stakes - your character can die in 2 or 3 hits, for one. Enemies telegraph attacks well enough, and are generally as weak as you are in health terms, so it's at least fair in that regard. It's less that the game is hard directly, and more that the game is unforgiving of carelessness; charging at an enemy as though they can be easily dispatched, like you would in most action games, usually ends up with your death.There's a fairly wide level of customization available in terms of gameplay choices, though. Souls are the game's currency, and are obtained from every enemy defeated. They are used to buy stat upgrades, spells, weapons, armor, and items. In essence, you have a fairly wide set of choices available in terms of how you play the game - as a direct fighter, as a lightly-equipped archer, or as a supporting magic-user. Your class influences your starting stats, but there are very few class-based limitations in terms of equipment and spells. As long as you've upgraded your stats to the right level, you can use almost anything.There is some difference in terms of what weapons are used, so there's at least a lot of diversity in terms of your character's development. In addition to enemy weaknesses, the weapons in the game also take how the weapon is used into account. Most directly, walls and corridors will make it impossible to swing a weapon - a problem if you're using a giant sword and can't get the room necessary to swing it. Generally, stabbing weapons like spears and rapiers are useful in close-range areas, while the giant swings of greatswords and polearms are useful in wide-open areas. It's possible to wield weapons one-handed or two-handed; it's also possible to dual wield weapons, to varying levels of effectiveness. The two kinds of ranged weapon are bows and crossbows: the former can be aimed manually, but requires two hands, while the latter must be locked on automatically, but can be used with a shield.Death in Demon's Souls is frequent, and comes with a few penalties. Upon death you become a ghost, with only 50% of your normal HP (though this is raised to 75% by an item found early on, which is much more tolerable). When you die, you lose all your current souls (but not items or abilities), but if you can get back to the spot you died in and touch your body, you can at least recover it. There are a few ways to recover your body, the most common of which is beating a boss while in spirit form. However, it's often not worth it - you can only beat a given boss once, and it's fairly easy to die afterwards to some simple trap or surprise attack. And given the number of things that are trying to kill you - soldiers, monsters, dragons, rolling balls, pit traps, and the occasional explosion - care should be taken at basically every opportunity.The game's multiplayer is probably its most innovative feature; rather than a direct sort of join someone else's game"" feature, Demon's Souls is more like a persistent online world where you can only occasionally interact with other people. The most common online interaction is messages. These messages are assembled from premade parts (""look out for the ____ ahead"", etc.) and left on the ground near whatever they're talking about. Any player can put down a message, regardless of content, so it can be used to help people (""there's a trap ahead"", ""don't trust this guy"") or to hinder them (""if you jump down into this bottomless pit you'll get some treasure""). Trustworthy messages can be recommended; recommending a message provides the player who put it down with an instant full-heal - something that's not to be sneezed at, especially during boss fights. Therefore, it's to the player's advantage to put down helpful notes, and the game is certainly hard enough to warrant them. In one case, for example, an otherwise innocuous NPC was marked with many runes nearby indicating that said NPC was a liar and I should attack him. As it turned out, the NPC was powering a ritual that made the level's boss immortal, and without killing him I never would have been able to beat said boss.The other way that the game presents a passively online universe is through player ghosts and bloodstains. The former is just a glimpse of other people playing the game - i.e., their characters running around in the same level you are in. These are mostly just there for show, though seeing a ghost pull a lever or break down a wall can provide a helpful hint. When another player dies, their bloodstain is left in the location where they died. If you touch a bloodstain, a ghost pops up and runs through the last few seconds of that player's life. This basically shows you where traps are in a lot of circumstances - you just have to watch for the part where the ghost ""dies"" when you go forward. In some cases, the presence of a great deal of bloodstains serves as warning enough.There are more direct ways of interacting, as well. When you're a ghost, you can offer your services as a Blue Phantom and enter another player's world as a cooperative helper. Beating the level's boss transports you back to your own game and gives you your body back. You can also take the darker path of the Black Phantom and invade another player's world; if you manage to kill them, you get your body back. Overall, there's not a lot of communication possible in-game. The messages serve as the only actual communication; blue phantoms must communicate with gestures and emotes, and there are only a few of these. There's no friend lists or anything along those lines, so you're really just grabbing any random player either as an enemy or a friend.The graphics in the game are excellent - the designs and effects are detailed and well-executed, there are plenty of incredible panoramic views (many of which can be noted with messages) and the characters all move with realistic weight and effort.  On the other hand, the Havok physics used in the game are completely ridiculous. Bodies, for one, can be easily kicked around by a player walking slowly into them, which causes them to go into humongous spasms and flail around. The sound is great, being distinctly atmospheric while also serving as a warning. The music is good, but only shows up for boss fights (in a manner similar to Shadow of the Colossus), while the rest of the game is music-less to let you focus on approaching footsteps or flapping dragon wings.As a whole, Demon's Souls is a great game with solid gameplay and fun online multiplayer. However, it's also a very unique game - casual gamers, people who dislike losing repeatedly, and people who want to play with people they know in real life are probably better staying away. The game's difficulty will drive away most gamers; even gamers who stick with it will likely find it frustrating when they die for the hundredth time. The online mode, while interesting and fun, is limited in its long-term applications due to the short ""pick up game"" nature of coop play.In conclusion, the game is a 9/10 for hardcore gamers, and a 6/10 for casual gamers.""",5,"well-made, well-executed, highly enjoyable game.",2009/10/15 0:00

AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B002AB7TX8,"N. Durham Big Evil""""",2,1,"If you're a PS3 owner, chances are that you've already heard various things about Demon's Souls.  No matter what you may have heard though, the one thing that you need to believe first and foremost before you even consider popping this game in is the fact that it is unbelievably difficult, incredibly challenging, and just plain unforgiving.  No mid-level save points, getting sent back to the beginning of a level after you die, re-spawning firerce enemies; yes, Demon's Souls is probably one of the hardest games you'll ever play, regardless of the genre.  That being said however, Demon's Souls is also one of the absolute best action/RPG's you'll ever play as well.  Technically speaking, Demon's Souls is simply a gorgeous sight to behold.  The level designs are foreboding, dark, and varied from one another, while the game's creature designs are brilliant as well.  The game's combat mechanics are intricate and deep, with boss battles being nothing short of epic as well.  Along with some great online features, Demon's Souls has all the makings of being a great game, and indeed it is, but it definitely isn't something for everybody.  As said before, the game's difficulty will frustrate you to almost no end, yet you'll keep coming back regardless.  If anything, Demon's Souls is reminiscent of the arcade/action games of yesteryear in these terms, and the game is all the better for it.  All in all, if you're looking for something spectacularly challenging and unbelievably difficult, Demon's Souls is just what the doctor ordered.  Don't say that you weren't warned though.",5,"A demonic, unforgiving blast",2010/1/11 0:00
A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B002AB7TX8,"Richard Baker BinaryMessiah""""",1,1,"The Good: Looks good, deep RPG elements, unique online modeThe Bad: Brutal, technical issues, repetitive, and did I say hard? This is for the hardcore RPG players only.Brutal. That is the first word that will come out of your mouth when playing this game. This is for the hardcore only and I strictly warn you before plunking down $40 for this game and regretting the purchase like I did. This isn't your straight up hack & slash game. Oh no not by any means. This game is all about level grinding and repetition. You will be punished for even trying to take that last-minute hit. What's the punishment? Going back the last save. Ha if only that were true here. You have to restart the entire level every time you die and you lose all your souls (XP). Yeah I screamed what as well when I found this out.The game is also hard to figure out. I had to do some research online to figure out how to play Demon's Souls because most RPG's aren't like this. Instead of a story that you follow through and advance through a game you get stuck in a central hub and have 5 connecting levels. You have to repeat these levels dozens of times to level up. You can go into any level whenever you want, and each level has four sections with a boss at the end of each section. Just getting through stage 1-1 was a pain in the ass. I died about over 20 times before beating that section.Another thing you will never know how to do is level up. It doesn't just happen like most RPG's. You have to get all your souls back to the Nexus (hub) without dying and talk to the Maiden in Black to level up. There are 999 levels and each time you upgrade and attribute that bumps you up one level. So if you upgrade strength, vitality, and dexterity that's bumps you up three levels. So once you figure this out you have to start soul grinding until you get to a high enough level that you won't die with every swing.Don't panic when you die though. If you manage to get back to the spot you died at without dying again you can reclaim all your lost souls and they will be added to what you currently have. Die before you reach there and the count is reset. This makes the game so frustrating and I even almost got an aneurysm from the frustration. A lot of enemies are tough and the fighting mechanics aren't all that smooth so you have to learn them and execute them well. It's all about skill.The fighting mechanics are pretty decent. You have a light and heavy attack as well as a block and parry button. All these are mapped to the shoulder buttons. You can switch weapons out with the left and right D-pad (assign them in your menu). Another flaw the game has, and doesn't make any sense, is that you can't sell items but only drop them. You think selling these would make getting souls easier, but From Software just had to make things that more difficult. On top of this you have a burden count (think Oblivion) and getting new armor and weapons isn't easy. You can upgrade weapons and armor by finding stones. These can only be upgraded at the Nexus (as far as I know).Another flaw this game has is there's no pause button. Yeah what? I couldn't believe you can't pause the game it's that hardcore. You just have to stand in a safe spot. This game goes out of its way to make you hate it to death. Yet there's something that makes you keep playing. You just want to keep leveling up and getting the next boss and fighting you way through the game. This is probably because you get so angry that you just won't let the game win. This also means you needs hours of your day to play this game since this is by no means a pick up and play game.I was so angry about the game that I didn't even mention the story. The story goes along the lines of a Deep Fog that has taken over the land of Boletaria and you must defeat the demons holding it there. It's not really much to ponder on, but its enough to keep you going. The voice acting is iffy and you will spend so much time leveling up you will probably forget all about the story.The game does do something unique and this is its online mode. Instead of having co-op or anything like that other people can help everyone else through hidden messages or bloodstains. If you come across a message you can read it and it will give you hints to help you through the level. These are pre-made messages that people can enter to helps others out. Most of the time these are helpful, but a lot are tricks. Bloodstains are a player that most recently died in that spot and you can watch their ghost"" to avoid getting killed yourself. Some times you will see white ghosts floating around in real-time and these are other players that you can watch to give you a hint. This is very unique and innovative, but the frustration of the game makes you quickly forget about it all.The game looks pretty decent. The graphics are a bit bland in areas, but its technically sound. There are some glitches like collision detection issues and wonky physics. Overall Demon's Souls is for the hardcore only enough said. If you want a hack & slash that's simple and fun don't get this game stay far away. So why did I give this such a high score if I hate it so much? Because the game is good itself and I just don't have the patience for this type of game. I'm not going to punish the game for my inability to play it so the people who can play this will enjoy it. It'll take you a good 10-15 hours just to figure out all the stats and how the game is played, another 10-15 to get your bearings and level up enough to attempt the game, and about 50+ just to get through the game. Each boss feels like a triumph and is very rewarding, but this game only rewards the patient.""",4,"The hardest game I have ever played, this is for hardcore RPG fans only",2012/3/28 0:00

A2582KMXLK2P06,B002BRZ9G0,B. E Jackson,0,0,"I mostly have positive things to say about the New Super Mario Bros. game.  Now I admit at first I thought the entire game looked like a big, overrated gimmick (by keeping the familiar 2D Mario engine and only enhancing the graphics to please the new generation of pickier graphic-obsessed freaks out there).I still believe the gigantic Mario power-up that enables the player to increase Mario's body size is VERY gimmicky.  This is because you can basically plow through absolutely *everything* including enemies, bricks, pipes, you name it.  Oh sure it LOOKS cool filling up the screen with Mario, but it only serves a slight purpose that wears thin after a while.  If you remember the advertisements that ran for this game a while back, it was seriously like this games reason for existence is so Nintendo can emphasize this ONE unique feature.  I still don't know where I stand with it either.  Maybe it was Nintendo's intention to try and base an entire gimmick around the new feature of a screen size Mario"" or maybe it wasn't.Anyway, moving on, some of the enemies are pretty awesome.  Now the bone dinosaurs wear sunglasses and remind me of Steve Miller for some reason (from the Steve Miller Band), the Cheep Cheep's are enormous in a few spots, and actually, *several* of the familiar foes have increased in size.This game is definitely influenced by Yoshi's Island and the original Super Mario Bros. more than anything else in the Mario library.  I come to this conclusion based on several reasons- the sound effects resemble the ones from Yoshi's Island for one thing, and you can collect red coins which, not only contain the same sound effects from Yoshi's Island, but the actual idea behind them was borrowed from Yoshi's Island as well.Speaking of coins, I can't help but think that collecting those big coins is an idea taken directly from Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest.  At least searching for these particular coins offers a fair challenge, and an additional boost in replay value.  Also whenever you step on those mushroom platforms, they make you feel dizzy which reminds me of the level Touch Fuzzy, Get Dizzy from Yoshi's Island.  Also baby Bowser came from Yoshi's Island.  Lots of Yoshi's Island connections all around.The connections to Super Mario Bros. lies in the level design, especially the very first level which is basically the same level as Level One with minor design changes.Speaking of challenge, those of you who grew up with the NES will probably feel right at home with this game.  It basically plays the same as those old school Mario games but with radically unique background graphics and innovative enemy designs.  I like these features.There's a new move Mario can perform where he jumps DOWN on coin blocks and bricks, and collects the power-up that way.  It's strange, but it works.I wish the final level was actually difficult though.  It's really simple compared to the final levels in previous Mario games (especially the NES ones) and it basically consists of simply dodging those burning cannons that temporarily shoot out fire- these were first introduced in the airship levels of Super Mario Bros. 3.Some of the boss fights offer unique stategies, which is commendable.  I REALLY wish the last boss fight with baby Bowser and actual Bowser consisted of more than just performing two lousy moves in order to accomplish, the second of which is downright pathetic.  I feel cheated.Overall- fun game, slightly easy perhaps, but it's still a pretty awesome game (especially for old school Mario fans).""",4,Mario looks more stunning than ever!,2012/1/21 0:00

And when word came out that it was coming to the Wii, I was excited and cautious at the same time. For anyone who played this on the DS, New Super Mario Bros. Wii looks very similar as far as graphics and sound effects. The two games even share the same multiplayer aspects. And that is where the similarities end.New Super Mario Bros Wii holds its own by featuring new stage layouts, new graphic effects, new music tracks, new enemies to defeat and fun, multiplayer games outside of the main story mode. And this game is much, much harder than the DS version (which is a great thing, IMO.) You can tackle this game alone or have your friends join in anytime. It's a blast to play with other people and this will definitely attract the old school gamers while the new generation gamers will be more than willing to try it out.My only gripes are the Wii is much more capable of pushing out great graphics so it kind of sucks that New Super Mario Bros Wii's graphics are slightly improved over the DS version. Also, this would have been a perfect game to feature online multiplayer so you can beat the stages with other people. But oh well, it's still a great game and worthy to be part of anyone's Wii games collection.

The save feature sucks and sometimes you will beat endless pit levels get tons of stars for star world only to find that it didn't save and you have to start over.  It only saves if you beat an entire world or you manually do it which is total bs.  The multiplayer is the worst I have ever seen in any game ever.  It's a total mess, virtually unplayable with more than two players and even then it's super frustrating because players can cut each others jumps short when jumping at the same time, jump on other players heads driving them into pits, pushing each other off ledges, hit each other with items, kill the other players if you run ahead of them even slightly, die if the other players run ahead or are too far behind you, glitch kill the other players if anyone dies as it freezes all other players for a second if one dies.  If you freeze glitch near an enemy it's game over or if in mid jump it glitch drops you straight down.....hence killing you instantly as 99% of the levels with exception of level 1 world 1 are pits.  The multiplayer in this game is trip over the other players feet"" style which I hate just like Battletoads on NES.  For a simple Mario game the controls are mangled, unresponsive and sometimes have a damn mind of their own.  The layout is simple but the response time from the game doesn't match the buttons your pushing most of the time and you end up dead. I have still yet to figure out if the game was made this way or not.  The sliding around, the delayed or no jump sometimes when you hit jump while running and terrible hit detection combined with the 99% pit levels is maddening at times.  I fail to see how this game is for kids, if more than one is playing this at the same time they will probally choke eachother...even single player is to difficult for kids with all the precision pit jumping required.  The cut scenes could have been so much better and actually have effort put into them rather then having the same exact scene 12 times when you beat castles.  I have beaten the game from start to finish worlds 1-9 three times over and overall it was a frustrating as hell experience due to the games horrid controls, mangled hit detection, tired endless pit levels and savagely crippled multiplayer.

It has been nearly 25 years since Super Mario Brothers came out, and the famous plumber from Nintendo has captured so many delightful hearts and the ability to save Princess Toadstool (a.k.a. Princess Peach) from the menacing destruction of Bowser and his alliances. With so many gamers still awaiting the upcoming sequel to the widely acclaimed Super Mario Galaxy next year for the Wii, they definitely know they are in for a treat. But, that doesn't mean Mario is waiting in the wings with something new months down the road. He has something new for hard core fans that brings in a whole lot of new excitement and challenges, with a bit of nostalgia for hard core Super Mario fans young and old alike. Back in 2006, when New Super Mario Brothers came out for the Nintendo DS, it really reintroduced the classic and driven platforming that die hard Mario fans have known for years, with a new generation of gaming on the go. Now, that classic gameplay and Super Mario Platforming we all have known and loved, is again here for the Wii's gaming fans and the excitement is definitely here.New Super Mario Brothers Wii for the Nintendo Wii, brings in all the classic excitement and gameplay we've all loved past & present with new twists in the hard core way we've played with Mario, Luigi and his friends for all these years. The gampley is very simple, as you go on another quest, trying to go through the depths of the mushroom kingdom, saving the princess from the doom of Bowser. The game has over 60 different stages in the mushroom kingdom which you battle classic enemies from goombas and koopa troopas, as well as outrageous enemies that haven't been seen in the Mario universe in years (especially Bowser's Koopa kids like Larry, Roy and Lemmy from the original Super Mario Brothers 3 from the old NES days) to score your way to the top. There are new and returning power-ups that help you on your challenge from the originals like the mushroom and fire flower and the returning Ice Mario (from Super Mario Galaxy,) to new power-ups that brings in outrageous fun like the Penguin Suit, that allows Mario to slide like the classic penguins on his belly through sheets of snow and ice, to help him trounce on enemies, and score points and extra lives, and the propeller hat, which allows Mario and Luigi to spin like a whirly-bird helicopter propeller in the sky, to help reach coins for extra unlockables and new challenges.The graphics look absolutely amazing, and brings in the simple and unique look that was drawn in from New Super Mario Brothers from the DS, well and recognized as a whole for classic gameplay. The control is also very simple to master, as you can play wither holding the Wii-mote like the classic NES controller that you've known and loved for years, or choosing to control Mario by using the Wii-mote & nunchuck controller, which also works very well too. The other additions that handle well iis the ability to play with Mario in a multiplayer melee challenge, by either helping your teammates through the challenging levels, or knocking them out to their doom and making them lose a life. The enjoyment never seems to end for the hard core Mario fan in you with this great challenge.All in all, New Super Mario Brothers Wii is a fun and delightful game that challengs you well with fun and energetic mayhem. I absolutely have to say it is a fantastic treat for the must have Super Mario fan in you, young and old. I absolutely loved how challenging the game looks and the gameplay doesn't seem to lose that muscle either. It is pleasingly, pure fun for anyone who loves the classic little plumber in the true and top form fun for all gamers alike that want their way to score through the mushroom-loving, Super Mario Brothers universe.Graphics: A-Sound: A-Control: B+Fun & Enjoyment: A- for multiplayer and solo playOverall: A-",5,Magnificent Mario,2009/11/15 0:00

The one biggest hoorah I also give the game other than the great graphics, levels, power-ups, and music is the ability to have multi-players during levels instead of having to wait your turn for one of the players to die on a level to get your turn to play, also a great new move is different bosses for every level end to defeat instead of having to fireball Bowser over and over again like the previous earlier Mario Brother games to rescue the princess.  The graphics again are incredible for the wii with the added bonus for old time players to use the remote like the stardard 8-bit Nintendo controllers of yesteryear, you can use the nunchuck to move your player around as well but it brings back a bit of nostalgic quality using the remote as mentioned previously.

Is that a good thing? Well, yeah. In fact, the first NSMB's popularity wasn't really stolen.It's an all-new 2D Mario game for the home consoles, and with an extremely huge twist. Along with going through 8 hugely awesome worlds, and beating the everloving heck out of Goombas in classic Mario gameplay, you get to do all this....with your buddies! 4 players sharing the same screen cooperating together in a 2D Mario game?

The solution? Press A and you will float in a bubble....but someone must pop the bubble to free you.The power-ups are now different from the DS game. Here, you get the Propeller suit. Shake the Wii Remote to rise up into the air. If you were to remove the propeller, it'd make an awesome racing suit for Mario Kart. Next is the penguin suit, in which you slide on your stomach, bashing through blocks with your face, while also shooting snowballs at your enemies. The Ice Flower lets you JUST shoot snowballs. The Fire Flower lets you shoot fireballs, of course. Since when has that changed?You can also be able to ride (drum roll please) YOSHI!!! 4 of them, in fact! A player can also be eaten so he/she can ride in Yoshi's mouth while the controlling player (riding Yoshi) makes his/her way through the many obstacles of a level.

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B002BRZ9G0,S. Rhodes,0,0,"Whenever Nintendo releases a system, you know a Mario game is right around the corner.  Usually Nintendo only gives fans one series"" Mario game and the rest are comprised of spin-offs such as Mario Party or something along those lines.  The Super Nintendo had Super Mario World, and while it had a ""sequel"" in Yoshi's Island... it was more Yoshi's game.  The Nintendo 64 received Super Mario 64.  The Gamecube received Super Mario Sunshine.  But the Wii?  Not only did it get Super Mario Galaxy... but it later got New Super Mario Bros. Wii and then Super Mario Galaxy 2.  While the two Galaxy games are 3D Mario adventures, New Super Mario Bros. Wii goes back to the classic 2D days.  If you were a fan of Mario games such as Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World in particular, you'll find everything New Super Mario Bros. Wii does to be extremely familiar.The story is the same as always.  Princess Peach--in an attempt to fill up her frequent kidnapping card--gets kidnapped and it's up to the Mario to save her.  Only this time he's joined by Luigi as well as two generic Mushroom people.  Like classic Mario games you'll traverse a world map, going from one level to the next in an attempt to save Princess Toadstool from King Koopa and his Koopalings.  There are eight worlds and one special world.For fans of previous 2D Mario outings, New Super Mario Bros. keeps it simple.  While there are alternate exits in some stages (similar to Super Mario World) there isn't much mystery as to where you might go or anything like that.  You'll know exactly where a hidden exit will lead.  It's not always obvious as to where the hidden exit is in a level, but the wonder of exploring isn't exactly here like in some of Mario's other 2D adventures.  This isn't exactly bad.  It's obviously to make New Super Mario Bros. appeal to newcomers more so than old.Much of what long time fans see here is going to be nostalgic.  When you go into levels familiar power ups are there.  The super mushroom and fire flower are there, as they always are.  But there is also a free flower for those who want it, and a penguin suit as well (which is much better than the blue shell from New Super Mario Bros. on the DS).  They're fun power ups to mess around with, and the ice flower even allows you to pick up frozen enemies and throw them.  Yoshi also makes an appearance here, but it's always something short lived.  After so many years of not being able to ride Yoshi in a Mario game, his appearance in New Super Mario Bros. Wii feels like something they could've done more with.  He doesn't appear in that many levels, and when he does you have to leave him behind when you clear a level.  It's a shame that Yoshi seems to be reduced to what can best be described as a cameo.  At least he's there... it's just a shame he doesn't have any real use.New Super Mario Bros. also has a multiplayer component.  For the first time in Mario history you and your friends can all be moving around screen at once.  One player controls Mario, another controls Luigi while the last two slots are reserved for the generic Mushroom men.  No one character actually plays better than another or is ever more useful.  They all behave the same way as well so there's nothing big here.  New Super Mario Bros on multiplayer can either be the thrill of your life or the most annoying asset ever.  It really depends on who you're playing with.  You'll all four be moving around, but it's pretty easy to get in one another's way or slow someone down.  You can also lift and throw your allies.  Meaning that if one friend is in the way and you're impatient you could essentially carry them through a level... or just toss them in a pit and not have to deal with them.  The desire to mess around with your friends is great, and sometimes giving into that urge can yield some hilarious results (or broken friendships... your choice).  On the other hand, because of the chaotic nature of the multiplayer you'll also screw up unintentionally.  This is especially true if you're playing with veterans of the platforming genre.Which brings about New Super Mario Bros. difficulty level.  Something that has been stated countless times.  If there was ever any proof of a generation gap in gaming, this is probably it.  Chances are, if you missed out on Mario's adventures on the NES and SNES then you'll find the game to be much more challenging.  But veterans of the 2D Mario games will notice the exact same tricks that worked back then... STILL work today.  If you survived through all the challenges of Super Mario World you're probably apt to wonder what exactly is supposed to make New Super Mario Bros. Wii so challenging.  Especially because the game will throw tons of extra lives at you.  New Super Mario Bros. Wii can be a challenge... but not for a Mario veteran.  The difficulty, I'm sorry to say, is greatly exaggerated.That's not to say there's no fun to be had.  In terms of 2D Mario games, these are by far some of the most creative levels you're ever going to find.  Each one throws a new challenge or new twist at you.  It's fast paced and fun.  And you don't mind going through it all again when it's over because they're so much fun.Visually, New Super Mario Bros. Wii is apt to strike most people as just a much more polished version of New Super Bros. on the DS.  It's more than that.  It's got lots of character in its animations.  The cartoon like charm is why it's easy on the eyes to begin with.  The music is also catchy and charming as well.  You might want some slight touch ups with the controls, though.  You'll hold the wii remote like an NES controller.  Running and jumping is the same as in the original games on the NES as well.  The motion controls feel tacked on, though.  From time to time you'll have to tilt the Wii remote when you're on a sail barge, for instance and need to manipulate the light.  You'll have to pick up and throw characters by shaking the Wii remote.  It's not bad, but there are times when it comes off like Nintendo trying to figure out a way to incorporate motion controls into a game that, for the most part, doesn't really need them.In the end, New Super Mario Bros. Wii is a fantastic package.  For those who never experienced his 2D adventures, it's a great introduction to them.  For those who already have... it's nostalgia.

AN81JUYW2SL24,B002BSA20M,Gearhead Mania,0,0,"Halo Reach Standard EditionBy now, most gamers have been engulfed in the Halo mythos, and well acquainted with the lore of SPARTANs and the Master Chief. Being a long-time player of first-person shooter games since the 1990s (Wolfenstein, Blake Stone, Doom), I've naturally played Halo, Halo 2, and a variety of other modern FPS games. However, I've not played Halo 3 or ODST, but I read other reviews indicating Halo Reach is by far one of the best Halo games to date. I have to agree with that consensus, mainly because Halo Reach takes many elements of story-telling, gaming, and immersing the player/viewer into a certain atmosphere and doing all of this quite well.Halo Reach differs from previous Halo games by introducing other SPARTAN characters that have unique personalities. The best way to describe it is to take Call of Duty Modern Warfare, mix in Medal of Honor 2010, and then give the main characters SPARTAN-III armor. You get to blow away enemies while using the guns onboard rotary aircraft (Falcon, instead of a Blackhawk/Little Bird/AC130), make near-impossible jumps onboard said aircraft (ala CoD MW/MW2), use aircraft to destroy ground targets (piloting the Falcon, ala Cobra/Apache/Hind), and even pilot spacecraft (Sabre) to engage in space combat (uh... sorry, no CoD/MoH comparison here).Some of the complaints I have are related to the vehicle controls. While Halo Reach does many things quite well, it still has the inadequate vehicle dynamics found in Halo and Halo 2. The warthog, Mongoose, and other wheeled vehicles don't drive"" like vehicles you typically use in other games. The split controls over the 2 analog sticks makes it confusing initially, but I am sure hardcore Halo veterans are already used to it. The Covenant vehicles are easier to maneuver because the controls feel more in tune with Descent (one of the first games to be truly 3D). The spaceflight controls aren't too bad, and it sort of resembles Descent Freespace or TIE Fighter.Another area that I'm not fond of is in the weapons department. I found myself often running low/out of ammo when I needed them the most. Examples include an Elite charging at me with an energy sword, or a Brute charging at me with a Gravity Hammer. The enemy shields are often a pain in the butt. It started to remind me of Republic Commando where your weapons inflicted minimal damage against shielded enemies and I often resorted to just using melee to take them out more easily.Call of Duty Modern Warfare / Medal of Honor offered better damage for friendly weapons, and granted this might make Halo ""easier"", but I'd assume the human race would figure out a new type of ballistic weapon that could penetrate shielding, penetrate armor, explode and set the enemy on fire in one single shot by the year 2552.I bought Halo Reach about a month after it was first released, and I received a redemption code for a free Spartan Recon Helmet. Unfortunately, this code did not work. I performed a Google search and found out that Microsoft apparently makes the codes limited use until a certain day or when a certain amount of people have received the avatar award. I just know that I tend to buy more stuff when they give out some freebies even though they don't have to do so, and it was disappointing that they gave me a code that wasn't functional.The sound effects and visuals are absolutely fantastic. Halo Reach is definitely darker and more immersive in nature than previous Halo games. The multiplayer modes offer variety and give a lot of replay value to the game. Some of the achievements were a true pain to achieve. For example, jumping off a cliff in the Pillar of Autumn map, and executing an assassination on an Elite just before you land took me about 90 minutes and hundreds of deaths! I still haven't had time to sit and earn 1,000,000 points in Firefight to get another achievement. Who thinks of these achievements??Overall, I give Halo Reach 4/5 stars!""",4,CoD MW and MoH meets Halo,2010/12/21 0:00
A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B002BSA20M,"Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...""",0,0,"A prequel in the long-running Halo series, Halo: Reach"" delivers more of the same basic gameplay that's been present since the original ""Halo: Combat Evolved""...and not much more.Essentially, Halo: Reach is the same game as previous incarnations of the Halo series. The basic gameplay - a first-person shooter with vehicle elements - is intact, albeit with some minor changes. These changes include new abilities (though only one can be ""equipped"" at a time), some new guns (most of which are functionally identical to older ones), and a few short sequences in helicopters or spaceships. Playing the actual basic game feels almost exactly like playing old Halo games, with basically the same weapons, vehicles, enemies, etc. Because it's a prequel, they couldn't really add anything substantial - not that this stopped them from putting in a few new guns and vehicles that never show up in later installments.One of the things that is, in a way, ""new"" is the customization of the main character. Previous Halo games have had customizable characters for multiplayer, starting with picking a color in Halo 1 and developing into different helmets, shoulderpads, and so on in Halo 3. In ""Reach"", the option has become available to pick a female Spartan (this option technically existed in Halo 3, but only affected the character's voice). In addition, the changes made to the model reflect in single-player, as well, since the Master Chief is no longer the main character.A lot of the multiplayer modes from Halo: ODST have been brought over, including the cooperative Firefight mode. Other than that, it seems to be the same mix of multiplayer modes found in previous games - deathmatch, CTF, and so on. It's not bad, but it's not really original, either. ODST at least tried to do some new things with the hub concept and so on. Halo: Reach is just a retread. While this might not be bad, necessarily, it just seems like a lot of effort to go to make a new game with no real new characteristics. Even the voice actors seem bored at this point; all their performances are flat and dull, with hardly any emotion put into it.There's an easy way to determine if Halo: Reach is a game that you, the consumer, will like. Did you like the previous games? Then you will like Halo: Reach. Did you dislike them? Then you will dislike Halo: Reach. It's almost more of an expansion than a new game. It's not a bad game in terms of design or graphics, but it's the same game as previous installments.Rating: 7/10.We purchased Halo Reach with our own money from a gaming store.""",4,Halo Fans will Enjoy It,2010/10/18 0:00
ADPEAVHFCNLLC,B002BSA20M,Poisoned Blade,1,0,"I never would have thought that a Halo game without the Master Chief would be great, but REACH is pretty amazing.Story: 9/10This is a prequel that takes place on the planet REACH, where a significant event happens in the Halo Universe.  I'm not going to spoil it here, though.  In the game, you play as a Spartan known as #6 and you join an elite special forces group of other Spartans to investigate a distress call.  Each of the characters have their own specialty, Jun is a sniper, Kat is a tech expert, Jorge is a heavy gunner...  What turns out to be a simple distress call ends up becoming a cataclysmic adventure.  (Because you weren't going to buy a Halo game to shoot a few rebel farmers who didn't want to pay their space taxes.)Graphics: 9/10The Halo engine has been revamped and it looks great, considering the long draw distances in the massive levels.  There are also some major events happening in the backgrounds as you play through the game.  The visual effects are very well done, the characters animate well, the vehicles, and environments all look outstanding.  If there was any room for improvement, I'd say the human faces could have used a bit more detail.Gameplay: 9/10Sure you can blow through the Campaign on Easy or Normal Mode, but this is like buying a swiss army knife and only using the toothpick.  REACH has lots to offer.The trademark of the Halo series has been its deep gameplay.  On Easy Mode or Normal Mode, you can run through the Campaign jumping over vehicles and smashing enemies in the face with the butt of your pistol, and taking down groups of aliens with your Assault Rifle.  You will definitely feel like a hero.  But if you play on Heroic or Legendary, you see the depth of the game.  There are two types of enemies that you face.  Those with energy shields and those without.  Coincidentally, there are two damage types in the game.  Plasma Weapons (which do more damage to shields and less damage to bodies) and Ballistic Weapons (which do less damage to shields and more to bodies.)  In the harder difficulties, you will have to use both types of weapons.  And lucky for you, you can carry two weapons at a time.  This makes the combat seem frantic as you make quick decisions about which enemies to shoot with what weapon.  Outside of combat, you also need to figure out what weapons that you should carry.  Shotguns are excellent at close range.  The DMR is a good all purpose rifle good for fighting at a distance.  The Assault Rifle is good against un-shielded enemies.  The Plasma Pistol is great against shielded enemies.  There are 20 different weapons in the game and all of them have their own advantages.Halo also has vehicle combat as well.  There are sci-fi versions of motorcycles, tanks, helicopters, anti-aircraft guns...  You can fight enemy vehicles in a vehicle or if you are skilled, you can hijack the enemy's vehicle and use it against them or destroy it instantly by busting open a hatch and dropping a grenade inside.In addition to the weapons and vehicles, the Spartans also have a special ability"" or an equipment item, that specializes their character.  These items are found in levels and picked up.  In Halo 3, you had Equipment, but they were single use and you were too afraid to use them because you never knew when you'd find another one.  In REACH, once you pick them up, you can use them as much as you want, but there is a cooldown period between each use.  Sprint, Drop Shield, Temporary Invincibility, Decoy, Active Camouflage, and Jet Pack are the abilities and they are pretty self explanatory.On the harder difficulty levels, the Elite Enemy Troops become more powerful, aggressive, and dodge grenades, forcing you to use tactics and improve your aim.The Combat of REACH is very dynamic.  Their AI is sophisticated and it knows how to take cover, flank you, steal your vehicle, drive a vehicle, and navigate around a massive map.  The combat areas are not tightly scripted linear levels, instead, the areas are open spaces with cover areas, high ground, flanking paths, etc...  This allows the players to use tactics to defeat the encounters.  Halo doesn't cheat with their AI, skills, and enemy abilities.  Most other games have tightly scripted levels, with simple enemies that only do one or two things.  This hinders replayability.  In Halo, everything is treated like it is a multiplayer experience.  Enemies can do everything.The physics on the objects are also dynamic and many of the objects in the environment are destructible.When you have open area encounters, with great AI, and deep tactics, players must use their problem solving skills to survive, instead of just relying on quick reflexes or temporary power ups.  REACH also records all of your gameplay and allows you to edit it and post it online.  Because everything is dynamic, AI, physics, complex combat system, there is a huge potential for Epic Victories and Epic Fails.Missions: 9/10The Mission Designs feature close quarter combat, open field combat, vehicle combat, air to air combat, space combat, low gravity combat, and air to ground combat.The Missions drive the story and feel epic in their execution.  (Don't just run though, stop and look around once in a while.)  There are a few cinematic moments in the missions themselves that aren't in the cutscenes.The level layouts are extremely tactical.  There is high ground, open areas for vehicles, flanking corridors, etc...  If you play on the harder difficulties and die a few times, you'll notice that there are always better ways to fight the enemies.  Also, the weapons that you want are always in the spots where you need them.  If you climb to the top of a tower... Hey look!  A sniper rifle just happens to be here!  If you are facing really tough enemies, the weaker enemies usually carry the best weapon to use against them.  Kill a grunt, take his plasma pistol, and use it against an elite!  Again, all of these subtle details are more apparent on the harder difficulties.Multiplayer: 10+/10You can play through the Campaign with 1-4 players, on 1-4 difficulties and Skulls.  (A Skull is a difficulty modifier that makes the game harder.)  You can turn on and off the skulls to customize the experience.REACH also features a firefight mode where you survive against waves of enemies, similar to Gears of War.  When you set up this game, there are tons of setting to make it extremely hard or extremely easy.Then there are the Vs. Modes.  They deal with killing enemies, or performing objectives on the map.  There are also a ton of these as well.And there is a FORGE, where players can edit their own multiplayer maps and play with their friends.Sound: 9/10The battles, weapons, vehicles, and effects all sound great.  The soundtrack is well done, too.  The only knock is that some of the in game combat dialogue is... err... not so great.Replay Value: 10+/10Halo Fans can play REACH for months.  Different Difficulty Levels, fully customizable coop and vs modes...Maturity:  TeenThe box says M, but Halo is just Humans vs. Aliens.  There is a bit of red blood from the humans and blue blood from the aliens.  There is no nudity, no swearing (unless you are playing online and the other players are cursing up a storm), no gore...  There is more violence in the Star Wars movies.  Seriously, the Star Wars movies are more violent than Halo.The reason Halo has always carried an M Rating is that when it was first created, the ESRB, pressured by congress, was overly concerned with ""head shots"" in games.  If you could shoot an enemy in the head for more damage, they gave you an M Rating.  The logic behind this was that games were teaching kids to shoot for the head because it does more damage, than shooting someone in the leg.  Wow... thanks ESRB and Congress.  Without video games, I never would have known that.  Really?  Head damage is worse than leg damage?!Overall:  9.5/10Halo REACH offers so much and it's only $40 now!  If you are a Halo Fan or interested in becoming one, this is the game for you!Buy it if you love Halo.Buy it if you love Sci-fi.Buy it if you love shooters.Buy it if you have an Xbox Live Gold Membership and will take advantage of all of the online options.Rent it if you just want to blow through the campaign on normal mode.It should take you 6-8 hours, but you'll be renting a swiss army knife to use the tooth pick.Avoid it if you have trouble aiming and don't want to practice.Unlike Call of Duty, there is no target lock aiming.This makes it a bit harder for casual gamers, but it also creates depth for the skilled players.""",5,REACH is the Best Halo Game of All Time,2011/2/16 0:00

A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B002BSA20M,"Richard Baker BinaryMessiah""""",0,0,"The Good: Best Halo multiplayer suite to date, more outdoor environments, co-op campaign, good ending to the campaignThe Bad: Armory is a gimmick, campaign is highly recycled, doesn't look up to par, enough Halo alreadyHalo. That word is loved and hated by many, but Halo did help define the FPS genre and FPS multiplayer for consoles. If it weren't for Halo we wouldn't have regenerating health, or solid FPS multiplayer, but Reach perfects the Halo multiplayer in many ways, but before we get there let's dive into the single player campaign.Reach has you playing as the generic Noble 6 who is part of other numbered Noble team members. You can create your character this time around, and swap out different armor parts, but you have to advance your rank and earn credits through multiplayer and playing the campaign. This is more of a gimmick and doesn't do anything than to add filler to the already bloated series. After the disappointing ODST we get another campaign with more nobodies instead of Master Chief. The game is set before the first one so you are experiencing the first contact with the Covenant. You are just hopping around Reach trying to save the planet only to realize you can't, and then you have to  use desperate measures to save the human race, but the story doesn't get interesting until the final cut scene (surprised?) and it's a shocker.The game is pretty much another recycling of the same Covenant aliens with better graphics. The same grunts, elites, brutes, and even vehicles; you name it. Is it ever exciting? Maybe in the very beginning because it's been awhile since the last Halo, but after the first couple chapters you just want the game to end already. The game just adds everything we've seen since 2001, and even takes away dual wielding which is good or bad depending on how you look at it. There are maybe one or two new weapons and vehicles, but everything's been recycled so much I can't tell! They couldn't even add an iron sight option since the left trigger is no longer used for a second weapon? C'mon!Other than that the mission structure is the same kill this wave, press this button, defend this place, backtrack and re-kill Covenant that suddenly appeared again. It goes on for ten chapters! There are a couple of space flight missions that are kind of fun, but it's not enough to keep you from yawning on the rehashed crap. Sure the campaign is solid and challenging, but it's not as spectacular as say Halo 2. At least the flood are absent which is a Godsend!But after slogging through the campaign you're going to come back for multiplayer right? Right. Which is the best the series has with tons of modes and playlists, and all the modes we've grown to love and a mix of favorite maps from past Halo campaigns. I'm not a Halo multiplayer vet so I can't tell you every tiny change, but I know enough that saving every match, sharing with friends, picking through their highlights, and so on is a lot of fun, and the Forge mode has been re-done to be a little more intuitive, but it's still no LittleBigPlanet, or say, TimeSplitters. The new daily challenges are the biggest incentive to come back since they advance your rank. They change daily and are a lot of fun to aim for, but the only thing you can do is unlock stuff in the armory with this, and that's not too exciting on its own, but it's better than nothing.Reach is also the best looking game, but it still doesn't look up to par, and this is sad being Microsoft's flagship series. The game looks good technically, but artistically it's kind of bland, but there a lot more open environments, and not too many indoor ones, so it's a lot more to look at this time around. All the same sounds are recycled as well, so you know what to expect in that department. With a so-so story, characters you can't get attached to, and a great multiplayer suite, maybe Reach should have been multiplayer only? Sure, no one would miss the campaign, but it's there. If you want to play through it again go online and play it co-op even if you have to, or try the hardest difficulty. Actually scratch that it's almost impossible.",4,"The best multiplayer in the series, but enough is enough",2012/3/28 0:00

A2582KMXLK2P06,B002BSA388,B. E Jackson,4,2,"Super Mario Galaxy 2 is, unfortunately, unforgivably bland. Simply put- it does not live up to the hype. It does not make the original SMG pointless in comparison (which is the ridiculous suggestion I've been reading on message boards by posters who are apparently still wrapped up in the hype machine to see things how they *really* are). The game basically copies every single aspect that made the original so great without adding much of anything innovative. Many of the enemies and obstacles are exactly the same, but placed in different environments and situations as a way to assure that any comparisons be kept to a minimum. The only problem there is that I can see through the disguise and take the game for what it really is: a decent continuation -but ultimately a shameless copycat- of a fantastic and highly original platformer in Super Mario Galaxy. This means not only does SMG2 hardly stand apart but it barely even warrants a purchase. This may be the first time in the Mario series I can recall where the follow-up (sequel) is almost exactly the same. Oh wait, there is one other example- the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2 (NES game). It's almost exactly the same as the first one, but most people either haven't played or simply don't care about the Japanese version of that old, overbearingly challenging game.It should be mentioned right away that the boss fights are much worse this time around. The strategies with bosses such as Bouldergeist and Bowser from Super Mario Galaxy encouraged me to sort through a fairly elaborate set of patterns concerning several different attacks until I finally figured out what it is I'm supposed to do. I mean while playing Super Mario Galaxy, I was standing there in my living room eagerly and excitedly trying to figure out their weak points all the while totally amazed that Nintendo actually went the extra mile in making them so varied. These are two VERY creative bosses that I happen to believe smear everything that SMG2 has to offer, that's for sure. What made them so extraordinary is that I was completely dumbfounded at the complexity of their attacks. This is coming from a Mario game???"" I'd frequently say to myself (since I grew up in the early 90's with Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World when boss fights were made extremely simplistic by only having to dodge a few moves and stomping on their head 3 times- the polar opposite of THESE fights). Everytime I made a mistake with Bouldergeist or Bowser (which was plenty of times I'm embarrassed to admit) it was the result of me being careless, not the game being cheap. Bowser in particular completely blows me away. His pattern consists of dodging SEVERAL fireballs, dodging his spiked-ball form, spin attacking his exposed weak point while he's rolling around in a temporary boulder formation, and carefully jumping over his many (up to 5 sometimes) layers of rings. If you mess up once and take a hit, Bowser seems to backtrack to his previous pattern and you have to successfully dodge these moves all over again. A far cry from say, luring him overtop a few layers of bricks so he can fall through the floor, or running underneath King Koopa on a bridge and reaching the end. Let's be honest, Bowser was bland in the early days with only fireballs and hammers doing any kind of damage. Yeah, this SMG fight is what I call extremely elaborate in comparison.Which brings us to Bowser's SMG2 battle. Well at least Nintendo had the good intention of making the boss fights strategic and enjoyable, but... it feels watered down and ""Been there, done that"" now. Bowser in particular is basically the same fight with only one or two new flashy moves (including launching high in the air and soaring down like a meteorite pounding the planet which is admittedly cool and encourages the player to ground pound these floating golden balls that temporarily hang in the air and smack Bowser's body) and it's impossible for me to believe anyone in their right mind would suggest this is in any way shape or form superior to his original incarnation from Galaxy 1 where the true innovation of boss fights and level design was in full swing. There's a gigantic floating snake boss that seems intimidating at first, but since he floats around the planet with a simple to take down strategy (all you really have to do is spin attack the rings on his body up to 6 times after hearing a familiar ""choo choo"" train sound effect as he shoots through the ground) he's not much of a threat and certainly not an appealing example of creativity. The fire snake fight is pretty hard, admittedly. Same battle, but he's on fire this time. I suppose the boss in Flipsville Galaxy is sort of unique- you have to walk under the floor (or over, depending on the situation) so you're standing directly underneath of the boss and ground pound his stomach. The bosses in Freezy Flake and Boulder Bowl Galaxy are WAY too easy and unnecessary inclusions.The darn piranha plant boss that screams like a baby comes back for another helping (you know, the first boss you fight in SMG) and this time he has no tail- you just repeatedly and mindlessly spin attack the cracked egg around his backside until it breaks and he dies. Why Nintendo felt the need to dumb down an already pathetically easy boss is beyond me. Just bringing it back is an even bigger question mark. A couple other bosses (and levels) come back for another round as well (such as an even easier to defeat Bugaboom, and that one thwomp area from Beach Bowl Galaxy but sped up considerably faster this time) and these are all totally pointless returns since we've already completed them in the previous game. Lazy programming decisions. I must say however, that the Megahammer is a really cool boss fight. You have to frantically run around platforms using Yoshi's tongue to gather torpedoes, and then launch them back at the glass sections of the Megahammer itself while dodging torpedoes and rings. Running around makes the battle quite the exercise too. Unquestionably a high point in the game. Bowser Jr's Boom Bunker is pretty cool as well, even though it's clearly just a gigantic screen-sized version of the Undergrunt Gunner from the first games Toy Time Galaxy with the same fireball-homing attacks and glass protection above his head. It only stands apart because you need a cloud flower this time given his enormous size.The music is a LOT worse too. Make that inconsistent- for every awesome theme we have to persevere a bad one. In the first Galaxy you had dreamy and effectively atmospheric outer space music of the Space Junk Galaxy, subtle touches of jazz in the grassy lands of the Honeyhive Galaxy (that's been remixed with unnecessary flutes here, though granted the flutes DO give it a peppy 70's feel similar to the Brady Bunch), the detective-like mysterious theme of the Bubble Breeze levels, and cool early 80's-resembling synths (particularly sounding like the rock band Genesis) in a couple of the water stages (such as Buoy Base). Actually the Buoy Base music plays in a stage here that strongly resembles the design of the Buoy Base itself, but dumbed down considerably with switch-hitting slow motion effects and less rotating platforms making for an easier climb in comparison. I do really admire a particular subtle touch when the music sounds like it's being played through headphones. This occurs briefly whenever you hit a switch. Not a fan of the cliched Middle Eastern music found in Clockwork Ruins Galaxy either.The music in this game just does not live up to the same incredible standard. There's a distinct style of jazz being played in several of the stages such as Yoshi's Star, Boulder Bowl and Throwback Galaxy. For my personal tastes, jazz music is completely inappropriate and distracting for video game music, especially in a challenging adventure game when concentration is mandatory for completion. Not the proper setting at all. At least the beach music this time is somewhat listenable. However let's give credit where it's due- one of the water themes is REALLY awesome (from Cosmic Cove). Dare I even say the best water theme ever? Probably influenced by the theme from the first Donkey Kong Country's water stage, it's amazingly effective in both mood and melody. Oh and Bulb Berry's Mysterious Glow (or rather Sweet Mystery Galaxy) contains another excellent theme that captures the feeling of dreaminess. I really DESPISE the theme from Throwback Galaxy. Perhaps you'd have to either be a huge fan of Super Mario 64 or simply have strong childhood memories of the Nintendo 64 days in order to appreciate this theme, who knows. Then again I can name an equally crappy song from Yoshi's Island and no special memories in the WORLD can make *that* piece of music any more enjoyable. The other water theme from Slimy Spring Galaxy sounds like some partial Radiohead-influenced ambient piece that doesn't work for me. I admit I absolutely LOVE the Upside Dizzy Galaxy theme. The main melody is based around one or two techno notes with a colorful dash of other rich and rewarding arrangements in the background. A well-performed song, as is the familiar underground Super Mario Bros. theme turned really eerie and haunting in the Flip-Out Galaxy.Only a few levels are superior to the ones from the first Galaxy in the fun department. It should be said that the ghost galaxy in this game (called Haunty Halls) is better than the ghost sections of the previous Galaxy only because these ones actually feel like *levels* where you have to avoid disappearing/chasing boos along with the obstacle of having to jump across several tricky designed platforms that come out of the dreaded dark matter. You better polish your shoes if you want to quickly make it across these moving platforms! Lots of dangerous and exciting situations this time around that really plays on the ghost theme- unquestionably influenced by Super Mario World's ghost houses. It actually FEELS like I'm going through a haunted house in SMG2. This was sorely needed in the original SMG's ghostly stages. The one section where you're surrounded by dark matter and urgently need to run through moving platforms is atmospherically creepy and it's quite intense making your way through. The ghostly portions in SMG are mainly occupied with ghost races which are really cool, don't get me wrong, but not as entertaining as the actual ghost stages featured here. I could probably do without the obvious Super Mario World moving platform imitation, however. I think the planet with these type of platforms is called Boo Moon Galaxy. Riding on them wasn't particularly fun in Super Mario World (because I remember how many times I'd miss and fall into the lava, ugh) and it's not any better here. I guess seeing the same set-up upgraded to a 3D environment is sort of cool, though.Several levels are flat out boring. The honey (bee) levels are back and the one called Honeyhop Galaxy is shorter and somewhat sloppy and rushed in its design with less emphasis on exploration. Honeybloom Galaxy is worse since it's based around a really easy 2D level design with hardly any dangers whatsoever. A level for babies or newbies. At first my impression of this stage is that it works magnificently as a fast-paced chase to the finish involving swinging over vines and avoiding pockets of water while in the bee form. Now however, I realize it severely lacks challenge. I feel the same way about the 2D swimming portions from the Cosmic Cove stage. Beautiful, but easy easy easy. The lava levels have segments that are really intense and nerve racking such as the one with the mad dash upwards across several fast-moving platforms while trying to hold onto a cloud flower, and the exceptionally frightening stage where a neverending parade of those lava monsters (that first appeared in Super Mario World) march down the screen and munch at the platforms, requiring the player to be really careful moving across- can you say pink elephants! However these levels ultimately fail to live up to the consistency and plentiful variety that the original presented with the Melty Molten stages and feel more like rehashes, and my goodness, who in their right mind thought it was a good idea to overload this game with so many darn gigantic CHOMP HEADS and OCTOOMBAS? They were implemented just enough in the first Galaxy to get your fill, but here? It's overkill, seriously. Chomps are rolling all OVER the darn place and octoobmas are located in every single place where they can get in a cheap hit (now occasionally shooting TWO rocks at a time, ugh!) The entire galaxy devoted to the numerous chomps is a nightmare too, especially the one where you have to spring bounce (or backflip) over an endless amount of chomps rolling across the floor. The level that is puzzle-like with the gold rolling chomps unfortunately isn't backed up by being any fun on numerous playthroughs. It's more like ""Oh that was clever"" when you figure out you're supposed to roll the chomps across platforms a certain way while *standing* and pushing down on the blue buttons, but definitely annoying to repeat this level again. Oh and you'll sometimes see MINI chomps as well (or kid chomps as I like to call them).The water stages are worse in SMG2. I admire the way the Cosmic Cove Galaxy alternates between 3D and 2D camera angles and swimming movements, and creatively uses a freezing technique near the beginning that makes the water and the scenery very beautiful. The part near the end where you're swimming through water cubes is unbelievably cool and a rare example of amazing design creativity. Still, none of this is the least bit challenging. I could definitely do without yet another bunny grabbing mini game though. I've had my fill of those from the first game. This rabbit mission is way more dangerous than all the ones from the first game combined due to the many holes that serve as endless pits, and the fast-moving ice skating skills needed to catch up to the bunny. However the first SMG game has so many unique and better utilized racing levels in the water with penguins, cosmic Luigi, whales, and an enormous bony fish boss fight with torpedoes that it comes as no surprise that the water stages in the sequel simply can't compete.There's a snow level here. It's not as enticing as SMG's Freezeframe Galaxy and it doesn't really do anything noteworthy that stands apart from the snow levels in several other 3D games, but I do admire the beautiful snowy environments. It's really short and generic with giants snowballs and snowgoombas everywhere. I admire the brief blizzard segment for the way it makes you feel secluded and lost somewhere in Russia. The sand levels -at least as far as collecting green stars- are MUCH harder this time around with more emphasis on overflowing rivers of sand and several rows of fast-moving fireballs. It's extremely easy to lose a life by making a bad jumping (or sliding) decision. Literally sliding off the entire river and directly into the bottom of the screen is a strong possibility. The sand often flows backwards, making the trip across even longer. I like a certain platform ride near the end of one mission, however. It involves magikoopas and yes, chomp heads. Magikoopa uses his magic wand and the chomp head uses his rolling ability to destroy portions of the moving platform that Mario is riding on, making navigation to the gold star tricky and fun. Bowser's final castle is rather disappointing since it's relatively bland in comparison to the fast-moving, obstacle driven intensity found in the first Mario game. The navigation through this one is slower, and the obstacles are less creative and threatening. It's inconsistent too. The part with the drill/pockets of sand/dodging giant bullet bills is boring with no replay value, and the segment with Yoshi near the end is downright tedious since controlling Yoshi whenever he grabs a dash pepper makes for plenty of jerky, awkward movements and plenty of deaths as a result of a rapidly closing wall made of fire that you'll discover. We've already seen rotating fireball rods mixed in with tricky camera angles for dramatic effect in the first game so nothing new in that regard here.Oh and the most insulting level imaginable is definitely the Throwback Galaxy. I don't mind the updated and prettier graphics of the Super Mario 64 levels (even though Nintendo is repeating what's already been done which just SCREAMS a lack of creativity) but what I DO certainly mind is the stage where you have to fight 5 bosses in a row from the first Galaxy. It's not only pointless to make us repeat the same bosses and strategies of the previous game, but it's also flat out boring and irritating since these bosses are the weak, easy versions and not the daredevil or speedy comet versions so there's no real urgency to try your hardest or even feel satisfied after you've conquered them. What a terrible idea to repeat what's already been implemented previously and a COMPLETE waste of time. Still, this is at least better than the levels that focus on red and blue platforms that open and close whenever Mario spins. Absolutely boring and a chore to go through these particular stages (the chore being, when you're not sure you'll make it across a long gap so you instinctively spin Mario at the end of a long jump and yet, spinning in this stage could result in a quicker death than you originally planned).The Supermassive Galaxy is obviously trying to recapture some of the magic that World 4 of Super Mario Bros. 3 used by scattering the levels with overgrown, super-sized enemies, however it's underutilized and way too short here. We've already seen giant goombas in the first Super Mario Galaxy, and giant green koopas and piranha plants were first presented to us, again, back in SMB3. This idea is nothing new or innovative. Oh and another major disappointment- another terribly bland beach level that reminds me of Super Mario Sunshine. Sorry Nintendo, but beach levels haven't been interesting in Mario games since Yoshi's Island. It's been THAT long! At least this one has Yoshi and spiny-throwing lakitus. The lack of interest is because these particular type of beach stages play on the ""beaches are relaxing"" theme (or in the case of a video game, ""beaches are less threatening"") which means these portions of the game are really empty with only a few enemies and dangerous platforms in sight, and honestly there's barely a reason why these particular stages should even exist other than tossing in a bit of variety. I mean if I wanted to take a breather I'd just put the game down for a few minutes. Beaches don't fit Mario games in my opinion. Oh and whether you're going through the stage normally or with the drill, it doesn't change the fact that Flipsville Galaxy is downright *boring*. I truly despise this stage. Drilling and/or flipping upside down over and over again just to progress forward... VERY tedious. The drill may be a cool item, but this is proof that basing an entire stage around it was a disastrous idea. The purple coin mission in this stage was initially horrendous due to the limited movements of using the drill, but better now that I found a reliable formula.I don't really like the cloud levels either (Fluffy Bluff and Cloudy Court Galaxy respectively) for a couple reasons. Again, the design of these stages is sickening and unbearably cutesy in a Super Mario Sunshine kind of way (the resemblance is immediately noticeable) and the cloud flower is overused in both stages (I'll share my feelings with this item below). Both stages share the same unbearably overdone orchestration. The Puzzle Plank Galaxy is fun the first time around, but never again. Catchy hoedown theme song at least. The Space Storm Galaxy was great until all potential was lost the moment I had to guide one of those darn red spinning topmen around several open holes and do this while avoiding these VERY annoying, tiny ricocheting type enemies that insist on pushing Mario over the side and to his death. The topmen were more tolerable in the first SMG game. The Battle Belt Galaxy feels more like a practice or beginners course stage for those unfamiliar with the game mechanics and the way Mario travels (star blasts) from one miniature planet to another fighting enemies that are basically generic and overused by this point. Even worse- this stage appears in World 6 near the end of the game! The worst spot to put a level like this. This stage is unnecessary in my opinion and feels incomplete. The Flash Black Galaxy is a total ripoff of an old Donkey Kong Country level where the lights frequently flicker on and off. Same idea here, but at least in the case of the SMG2 level it's saved by unique floating movements by Yoshi. However I found out that sticking to the left the whole time guarantees an easy trip to the launch star- turn right when you reach the top ceiling. Oh well. Some of Bowser's stages are boring. I already mentioned Bowser's Galaxy Generator (the last one) but Bowser's Fiery Flotilla is dreadfully dull and short (as is Bowser Jr's Boom Bunker which isn't even a stage really).Much to the displeasure of thousands (if not millions) the rolling starball levels are back and more complex than ever! Oh and get this- while riding and maneuvering the ball you actually have to push chomp heads off platforms. No kidding. You can probably sit there and imagine how difficult this is, however nothing and I mean NOTHING is harder than the purple coin mission where you're rolling down a steep rainbow-colored hill at lightning speed and forced to collect (if memory serves) 100 out of 110 coins. This means you can only miss 10 coins while riding that horrendous starball and trust me, it's VERY difficult. You better believe you're in for a rude awakening with this stage, haha. I wish the bubbles and stingray race levels from the first Galaxy made a return. They were awesome, however in Galaxy 2 you get gliding levels with tedious and jerky movements. The backgrounds may be beautiful (especially the dark green trees and peaceful flowing rivers in Wild Glide Galaxy) but the frustratingly SUPER slow control movements of the actual gliding makes it hard for me to enjoy these stages. I REALLY wish you could pick up speed by simply holding down the A button. Instead, speed increase occurs by pointing the Wii remote down but... depending on the mission, sometimes this isn't reliable enough to gain enough speed. If you remember stingray racing was fairly simple since the object was to just make it to the goal in under 3 minutes. I wonder if the generous 3-minute expectation is because Nintendo thought people would struggle to just keep the stingray on the slippery and narrow water track? We'll never know the reason for such a generosity. Anyway, back to the rolling starball level with the chomp head. Get this- you actually have to re-do this stage if you want the extra star, and this time you're TIMED! As if maneuvering the starball wherever you want it to go isn't difficult enough. It's a nightmare, trust me! Still, the requirement in memorizing the ramps in Rolling Coaster Galaxy is necessary in order to collect 100 purple coins which easily makes it the second hardest level in the game.Yoshi is a decent addition but he's not as frequently available as you'd probably expect given all the hype he's received from the numerous online reviews you've probably read. He's in a few levels though, and while he's there he's certainly fun. An extremely easy and effective way to get rid of enemies maybe, but fun. Mindlessly and constantly tapping the B button makes using Yoshi WAY too easy. You'll find out what I mean when you play the game. Otherwise I can take or leave him. The powerups are somewhat cool, such as the boulder that can charge into (and break) heavy objects. I like this one the most because crashing into objects feels impactful and adrenaline-rushing. There's a boulder level where you have to jump over a series of platforms and it's probably going to result in over 100 deaths until you complete it. This is all because of one tricky part at the very end where you have to roll into a bouncy thing that makes you go in a completely different direction, and then forward up the path to the star. You have to accomplish this without rolling off the side. It's incredibly hard believe me. Some people complain about the stiff controls, but to me it's understandable that controlling a boulder would be difficult. The drill is alright I guess. You can dig through the soil and land on the other side of the planet. This is used in a fairly clever way on a few occasions- you can take out enemies and bosses by popping out of the soil underneath their bodies for a nifty attack. However it's a severely limited powerup used mainly for just these two purposes. The honey bee makes a return as well, and it's exactly the same. With all this said, I REALLY don't understand what makes the cloud flower so appealing to the masses. It's really not that fun skipping through several portions of a level by creating/floating on clouds; just convenient. It's used WAY too many times throughout the game as well. Yes I realize the main purpose of the cloud flower is to be able to reach the really high or far out areas needed to collect certain important items, but come on, it's definitely not very exciting to actually *use* and fans are clearly overrating it. Perhaps the ice flower not being included this time around is a minor disappointment because it was pretty fun bouncing off walls and waterfalls with it, but at least the classic fire flower has remained. I enjoy the return of the hammer brothers even if they only appear in a few spots. They're much easier to handle in a 3D environment since the main challenge you faced in the older games was making sure you were able to successfully jump over (or run under) them without eating a hammer for your troubles. Now you can simply counter their moves by walking to their side (thank you 3D world!) and spin attacking them into pieces, easily avoiding the tossed hammers.Like I mention above, those dreaded purple coin missions are back and you may have already guessed- some of them are really a chore and time-consuming to play. One mission (Flip-Swap Galaxy) has Mario flipping through platforms while trying to avoid electric beams and rolling chomp heads which is a REALLY high challenge that requires accuracy of the highest extent. You can't make a single mistake either. In another level (Clockwork Ruins Galaxy) Mario collects coins while riding a few clockwise-rotating wooden or stone structure, and what makes it annoying is the way the rotation plays tricks with your mind- you WILL mess up, slide off and fall to your death. Guaranteed. Oh and what's now considered one of the hardest levels of all-time from the first Galaxy (Luigi's Purple Coins) returns, however now it's been dumbed down- the golden platforms no longer flip over. It still has the ""step onto once and they disappear for good"" green platforms, however. More or less the same idea returns, but now it's tame in comparison. The purple coins are easily within reach now. They threw in Mario clones (enemies that follow Mario's every movement- don't touch them) but they hardly ever interfere with your focus to collect the coins. I guess Nintendo received some hate mail from fans voicing their displeasure with the trickiness of Luigi's Purple Coins so they toned it down for the sequel, haha. The Yoshi mad dash purple coin mission in Starshine Beach Galaxy is fun but it's over before you can even blink your eyes, and the one purple coin mission where you're underground and encouraged to move quickly in order to avoid the Mario clones and grab the bunches of coins grouped together sitting on the small steps is another *extremely* short one. We're talking less than 30 seconds here for *both* missions. Not sure why the latter even exists- it's practically the definition of bland.Let's not kid ourselves however- the hardest stage by FAR (called Grandmaster Galaxy) is 100% guaranteed to have gamers pulling the precious hair out of their head. You have to go through six EXTREMELY difficult portions of the stage without taking a SINGLE hit. Let's break down how challenging this really is. First you have to carefully twirl your way around several floating rocks, paragoombas and torpedoes with Yoshi's tongue while being in the air the whole time, then you must step on several extra large blue platforms and make them turn yellow in order to open the launch star without eating two homing electric beams for your troubles, then you must make several cloud flowers and float over a series of electric beams that occupy the top and bottom of the screen with a few tricky spots in between, then you must properly figure your way through a series of red/blue flipping platforms while avoiding homing fireballs, laser rings and more electric beams (INCREDIBLY hard)... then you find yourself surrounded by even MORE trickily placed electric beams and paragoombas using the pull stars, and the hardest part of all comes last- dealing with quite a few insistently vicious hammer and boomerang brothers. Luck is pretty much the only way you'll make your way through a neverending swarm of spinning boomerangs and hammers in the final segment. In fact these obstacles are so difficult I just pretend the daredevil portion of this stage doesn't exist and settle with 241 stars. If you know what's good for your sanity, you'll take my advice and avoid this stage like the plague. It makes the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2/Lost Levels a cakewalk in comparison. The good news is that you're given the option to play through this stage the normal way (without the ""one hit you're dead"" way) which is STILL really hard regardless.The good news is that the very best level in the game hands down smears ALL the levels from the first Super Mario Galaxy- Tall Trunk's Purple Coin mission. This is easily the most exciting and coolest level ever for a Mario game. It's a fast-paced race... on feet! Is it sort of challenging properly landing your jumps, avoiding crawling wigglers and collecting enough coins? Absolutely. Is it fun? Absolutely! I'm also rather fond of a few mini games. The 5,000-point boulder/bowling mini game is a highlight, and especially the ones where you have to jump on enemies heads and produce enough points to reach 10,000. These ones in particular are *awesome* and a very useful way of temporarily bringing back the point system. I never cared for gaining enough points in the older Mario games since the only reward was achieving a really high score and bragging rights for beating your friends record highs, but now -with this challenge- there's a clear and exciting purpose in getting enough points. There's a 10,000 point mini game in the water where you can ride a koopa shell and destroy ghosts and weeds that's equally as much fun. The ice skating point games involving a monkey are pretty cool (but the second one that requires 600 points is WAY too hard). I also really love the missions where you only have less than a minute to take out a pack of octoombas in Shiverburn and Flash Black Galaxy. On the negative, I really miss the cosmic Luigi races from the first SMG game. They sort of remind me of Super Mario Kart but on feet. Also, the robot mini games this time around are honestly rather simple- you have to destroy a bunch of crates using a fire flower in under 30 seconds. A shallow game compared to the demanding bomb-tossing accuracy and short time limit that the robot requires out of the player in the first Super Mario Galaxy.""",3,it's okay but...,2011/4/24 0:00
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B002BSA388,"Michael Kerner Michael Kerner""""",55,43,"There is no doubt about it that Super Mario Galaxy remains as one of the most defiant games for the Nintendo Wii. Since it came out in 2007, it has re-shaped the way Nintendo has delivered its favorite pint-sized plumber. The game really delivered in a whole new dimensiion by showcasing Mario in Zero-G with more excitement and challenges than you could definitely imagine. Now with all that hype Super Mario Galaxy 2 has finally came out and fans all over want even more of their Mario mayhem in spades, but the question is that does the sequel lose any of the formula that made Super Mario Galaxy so superb. The answer is absolutely no, it just simply adds more challenge and more mayhem to it.Super Mario Galaxy 2 is definitely one of the must-own games of 2010 that really is worth the money that is spent on. The game takes on new challenges as Mario is again sent into space trying to rescue Peach from the clutches of Bowser, accept this time the challenges are more extreme as Mario faces new worlds from a intergalatic Giant World, to tougher foes than before like Peewee Pirhana and king-sized Bullet Bills, all the way to a even more challenging Giant-sized Bowser that is even larger and fiercer than before. But Mario isn't alone in this game to face them. He has Yoshi as well in this game, and the use of Yoshi here is well worth the effort as you control him and Mario in levels that are beautiful and bolder than before.There are also new power-ups here too from the cloud suit, where as you jump you can make clouds become simple platforms to help you on your quest which can help you earn those extra stars, and the Rock suit that can make you Invincible as you can easily smash your way through foes and rocks to uncover hidden star bits. that'll help you earn lives as well as defeat harsher enemies. Yoshi as well has some tasty power-ups like the blimp fruit which makes hime float on air and help you get to certain platforms you couldn't do alone, the bulb fruit which helps you see certain levels that might dissapear when you're in the spooky levels of the ghouls and Boos and levels that might be spooky in the night, and the dash pepper which makes Yoshi move like a speed demon through to help you try to race your way around the extra Zero-G madness.The graphics are absolutely amazing through the game, and picks up nicely where the original Super Mario Galaxy has left off. The control also is strong here, with the aid of Yoshi as well, as it is easy to manuver with him as he can easily swallow Bullet Bills and Pirhana plants that'll help you on your quest, and spit them out at other goombas and lakitus that won't take no for an answer. The music though does bring back at times classic melodies from past Super Mario Brothers titles like the first Super Mario Galaxy did, but remains as epic to appease the hard core Mario fan. Nevertheless, the fun here is absolutely well-worth the effort from each and every level with new challenges and mayhem that is sure to keep your Wii plugged in for days on end.All in all, if you're a owner of the Nintendo Wii and you've loved the original Super Mario Galaxy, than I absolutely recommend Super Mario Galaxy 2 as a great addition to your Wii library. It really does the job where any Mario game really should, and is a real treat for the gamer in all of us. I really love this game from the moment I've seen it and laid eyes on the madness, and trust me you'll not even be dissapointed with it either. It is well-worth the wait and Super Mario Galaxy 2 delivers from start to finish on the fun.Graphics: ASound: A 1/2-Control: AFun & Enjoyment: AOverall: A",5,Mario Madness,2010/5/23 0:00

In the past NINTENDO has made a number of bad decisions yet the company always manages to land on its feet for nothing else but for a single reason: it never forgets that gamers want first to have fun. And SUPER MARIO GALAXY II is an excellent example.The Wii console may have been made such a huge success story by applications such as Wii-FIT, but it will be remembered for the fun it offers with games such as this one. SUPER MARIO GALAXY II makes the Wii shine at its best.Princess Peach cannot seem to stay ...un-kidnapped more than a week, so her faithful plumber has to move heaven and earth to save her - yet again...But do we really need an excuse to dive in this galaxy of magic mushrooms, star-bits and coins, secret levels and surprising solutions to, apparently, insurmountable obstacles?The levels blend beautifully 2D and 3D environments and the controls work superbly. I hadn't touched a console since my University years and had to get used to the controls of ZELDA: TWILIGHT PRINCESS - yet found the controls of SUPER MARIO GALAXY II to fit like a glove from the very first moment.This installment is not one you can breeze through, there are challenging moments. If you get stuck in a level you can ask for a mini-tutorial - but keep in mind that there is no free lunch in this galaxy: your need for assistance will be marked. Then again, retrying a level was never more fun.There is invincible Rainbow-Mario, Rock-Mario, Spring-Mario and Cloud-Mario. And then there are Lumas and Yoshi. Every world has been imaginatively designed and gorgeously drawn. It is like a supernova of creativity exploding again and again. I believe this to be the best looking game on the Wii.And it is THE BEST PLATFORM GAME EVER!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5,A WHOLE NEW GALAXY OF FUN!,2010/5/24 0:00

The game controls are the same as with the first Mario Galaxy game for the most part and I appreciate that since it's sometimes of a headache when you play one game and the sequel to it comes out with almost totally different control actions, also the addiction to the game is the mini-bosses you have to fight along the way and the different ways you have to defeat them.

It really feels like a good movie.-----------------------------------------------------------GRAPHICS:Seriously the BEST looking faces in a video game eveer, very realistic face textures. Nice lighting, gives you the feeling as if you are watching a movie. Very detailed surroundings and buildings. Clothing looks most of the time very good. Some items look really good, and some are seriously very bad looking, such as a napkins or paper.-----------------------------------------------------------SOUND:Superb voice acting!.Very nice, orchestral music, it really helps giving you the mood depending on the situation.(not that I actually payed any attention to the music lol)alsoo something that I really liked is that the game gives you the option to choose the language and subtitles you want it on.-----------------------------------------------------------ANIMATION:Characters faces and bodies move realisticly thanks to motion caption, though hands seem to be a bit off sometimes, a good example is like when people clap. (seriously looks very crappy lol). Ohh also I noticed and I'm sure other players did also, that clothing movement looks very odd, when a character is wearing it looks very good, but not when they are moving it such when they change their clothes.----------------------------------------------------------EXTRAS:There really aren't many extras in this game (well atleast not in the US version). You have some clips to watch and a few drawings, and that's about it.----------------------------------------------------------CONTROLS:I really liked the quick time event thing, but I have to say that the game developers really screw up in how they made the characters to move, you have to use your annalog stick to choose were you want to move, but you need to press R2 to actually start moving. Infact that isn't that bad until you are in a small space or with a bad camera angle and your character starts to move like stupid.---------------------------------------------------------DIFFICULTYSuper easy, I never died even though I used the hardest mode.And I actually suck at playing games lol.In this game you will never get lost, or get to a point were you don't know what to do next. It's kinda linnear gameplay, but you choose the path you want to take.-----------------------------------------------------GAME DURATION:Seriously, this was a huge dissapointment for me, such a greaat gamee with awesome story, but supeer short!It is the only game I've ever finished on the ps3, and I finished in only ONE day, I mean come oon, all this time wating for this game to come out to finish it in only one day u_u.-----------------------------------------------------TECHNICAL ISSUES:I noticed a few bugs during gameplay such as sound being clipped or being offsync sometimes. Two times the game froze completely and had to hard reset my ps3. A few save issues, that when I continued a saved file it wouldn't start, or it would leave my character out of the map literally forcing me to restart the game.Probably they will make patches later on; well, atleast that's what I hope so..-----------------------------------------------------REPLAY VALUE:It is pretty high, well only if you want to get the platinum trophy.-------------------------------------------------------CONCLUSION:I really liked this game, most of it because of the story which sucks you in. If you like great story telling like me, then you should GET THIS GAME. If you hate short games DO NOT GET THIS GAME lol cause it will piss you off when you finish the game under 12 hours even though you didn't rushed through the game and you interacted with every single thing you could in the game.It really is a movie...or game whatever..

The loading screens show detailed faces, flicking veins in the orbits of the characters eyes, individual pores, and an overall breathtaking set of graphics. Combined with a ridiculous amount of actor driven motion animations, and you have a life like set of characters in a pristine environment. Audio is the same, with dozens of hours of plot driven dialogue. Certain scenes are cookie cutter to advance plot, but these are few and far between.Gameplay however is where some serious trouble occurs. Walking is almost agonizing, identifying actions is vague and uncertain, even in simple circumstances, and not enough time is given to make certain choices. Combined with the orbiting decision buttons, which are indistinct on even top shelf TV's, combined with unhelpful descriptors make picking certain choices are wing and a prayer event, especially since you can't rewind unless you reset the game prior to autosave points. This is compounded when your character is panicked"" and the wobble and indistinctness is made worse. While I can appreciate the theater of it, when I'm guessing at what choice I'm making, its not really a choice. The decision tree is gigantic, and no real viable method was put together to go back and try again, without basically starting from scratch. A 'Prototype' style mosaic(made instead with unfolding origami perhaps?) would have helped tremendously to allow players to revisit their plot from their favorite points, rather than restarting and hoping they do it just right this time would have helped.The story is flush and full, but some characters detract tremendously, and deus ex machina's crop up periodically and nearly ruin the story, though I had a watchful eye out after the last debacle from QD. Action scenes flow well, but the greater parts are nearly lost in moments of mundanity. While I can understand the action for opening the fridge, and another for removing a pizza from said fridge, I think the rational conclusion is to close the fridge without requiring a quick time event. That said, the action scenes allow you to appreciate the scene and play the game, though sometimes the tunnel vision gets pretty bad, but this is mostly absolved by setting the game on the lowest difficulty.Overall, this game is fantastic, and unless you follow one of the leads advice and only play it once, there's an ocean of replay value and radically different endings that require more than yes/no lynchpin decisions to get.

While at times choice can come down to simply ""you either saw this or you didn't"", Quantic Dream loves to tell entirely story-driven games with quicktime events mainly and of course this can cause divisive opinions: a game that plays itself or a unique way to tell a story without having difficulty curves, hard bosses or combo systems. With dark subject matter, sex and nudity, violence and a film-noir tone not to mention a huge amount of hype, can Heavy Rain reach a wider audience than say, God of War 3? Hope it does since it'd be cool to see more of these kind of games. Game isn't flawless though and I kind of wish it was considering how well it does everything else.Story: My god the story, easily the best thing about the game. Great characters, way better directed than Indigo Prophecy (camera angle wise) and those of you who love murder mysteries will love this. Basically the story is about the Origami Killer, a serial killer whose MO involves kidnapping young boys who are then found roughly 3-4 days later with an orchid on their chest and an origami in their hand. You play as 4 characters, Ethan Mars, Madison Paige, Scott Shelby and Norman Jayden who all have their reasons for going after the Origami Killer. But depending on your actions, not everyone will live but you'll uncover more of the story if everyone's living so do your best to keep them alive.Graphics: Indigo Prophecy even on a PC had a weird grainy quality, graphics looked slightly fuzzy but it looked well enough. Well ho.lee.crap did Quantic Dream take a leap forward with Heavy Rain. Aside from the ""uncanny valley"" quality, the game quite frankly looks stunning and there's so much attention to detail especially in the sets that it seems they spent so much attention to make these places look like actual places and that can also apply to the characters such as the loading screens and even smaller touches such as the water dripping off a body after taking a shower and of course rain is constant outside which also has a great look. One weird minor thing was that a lower brightness made a really David Fincher-esque lighting where it looked incredibly moody yet it was hard to see yet higher brightness made everything looked even more awesome but lost the lighting atmosphere low brightness did. But that's me.Sound/Music: Also really pleasant is the music which can be haunting and almost tranquil with piano but then it can get really intense which really makes the more action-y set pieces even more energetic. But where it's going to divide people is in the voice acting which doesn't quite have the same quality the storyline demands. The voice actors can range from really well-done (Norman Jayden might be your new favorite character) whereas other characters kind of have a weird flat tone, almost as if what they say is disconnected from where they actually are. These are mainly found in the ""L2 choices"" where holding L2 brings up a list of things your character can think which at times can just not sound right. But there's a huge number of voice actors so you're going to see a whole range of good to great character voices.Gameplay: In one way, I can describe Heavy Rain as a hardcore gamer that casuals can play. While this isn't as banal or empty as most casual titles, you don't necessarily have to be a frequent gamer to play Heavy Rain. The bulk of the game is QTE-driven where you either do an analog motion with your right analog a la God of War, face buttons, Sixaxis movements or your shoulder buttons. For example, getting up out of bed might be Up, drying yourself off after a shower will require some controller shaking or using your hands can be shoulder buttons. Where it can get tricky is using a lot of these at a given time. For example, in one scene you have to tend to a baby in which you lift baby up with R1 and work on the diaper with the analog while still holding R1 and that doesn't even include some of the more complex uses. But they're a vast improvement over Indigo Prophecy where a Simon-Says type display was on screen and you had to use your analog sticks in a certain direction or your mouse which usually resulted in confusion as to which side required what action.The other part to Heavy Rain and unlike the quicktime events, something that wasn't fixed is the walking controls. Here you hold down R2 which makes you walk forward while the left analog controls the direction. For any who have played old school Resident Evil will find it's somewhat similar in that one button moves character forward while you steer but where it gets unwieldy is trying to navigate the environment only for your character to re-enter a room because you didn't properly steer them towards the other door. Be prepared for a lot of turning and re-turning in a specific spot trying to get the QTE prompt to show up. Also one thing people may not like is that there's no run. You walk the entire game in these scenes and unlike Indigo Prophecy where environments were at least a bit open, there's not a whole lot of room in this game to run anyway but to walk so slowly to where you need to go only for cutscene to activate and have character sprinting seems odd.One thing that I do like about the story (just to re-visit that for a minute) is that your decisions will not always bring about the most obvious outcome. Mass Effect 2 had a problem with this where regardless if a character was completely mean and anti-you, having a paragon choice completely turned a character around and he just walked away from you. One scene in Heavy Rain, there's a scene where as the detective Shelby, you're trying to get information from a prostitute about her son who was one of the Origami Killer's victims. One dialogue option makes Shelby be very tactless and very blunt about her indifferent attitude and she decides yeah, you're right, you do got a point and decides to open up. Another scene you decide to get on a convenience store clerk's good side but he throws it right in your face and completely calls you out on your BS which can result in not getting anywhere. This can set up added pressure where characters can be affected by the littlest things or biggest things. My only complaint is that this doesn't mean the game will wildly deviate with your choices. Like in the above convenience store example, a robber comes in intent on getting some cash. This can result in one of 3 scenarios: you sneak up on him and knock him out, you get caught only to then knock him out or convince him to leave the store. I did the last 2 and I still got the same result but in certain other scenarios you can do actions that will completely change the ending.How appropriate it is that Heavy Rain comes out within a month of the looooong yet linear Final Fantasy XIII and the short but linear God of War 3. Seems like a big month for the Playstation 3 and unlike those other 2 where you can be into that style or not, I'll wholeheartedly recommend Heavy Rain not only because you don't often play this type of game much but also because it helps support the whole ""sequelitis"" thing going on that lets unique games that become successful potentially inspires them to try new things too. But really you can be into this game by surprise or just not find it your style but definately play it.""",5,Storytelling evolved or flawed experiment?,2010/3/7 0:00
A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B002CZ38KA,"Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...""",3,3,"Heavy Rain is touted as being interactive drama"" - a game defined primarily by story and choices, rather than combat. While the degree of ""interactivity"" may be questionable, there's no doubt that as a game this represents an entirely new genre - not quite open-ended, but still offering results for the player's actions.Heavy Rain tells the story of four characters: The single father, Ethan, the detective, Scott, the journalist, Madison, and the FBI agent, Norman. Their stories are told as short vignettes - the perspective will start at Ethan, switch to Scott, then to Norman, and so on as the story warrants. Their stories center around the Origami Killer, a serial killer so named because of the figures he leaves on his victims. Each character is trying to investigate the killer for different reasons, and while their investigations start out entirely separate they inexorably end up caught up in each others' stories.The game is carried out through what are basically quick-time events. In some segments, the player character will be allowed to walk around and interact with their environment by making the appropriate movement when near an object. In action sequences, the player simply has to hit the buttons (or do the appropriate motions) when the icon for it pops up. Both try to have actions be fairly intuitive based on the motion. The game's use of occasional motion controls, as well as making the button display shakier in times of stress or crisis, both add atmosphere and player connection to the events of the game.The game's ""choice"" varies between the two kinds of sequences. In free-moving sequences, the player is allowed to make an occasional decision that will affect the development or ending of the game. In action sequences, the player's goal is simply to survive - messing up too many quick-time events (or one important one) will actually kill the character off permanently. For that reason, there's always a really impressive sense of weight and drama during these scenes, instead of annoyance or irritation on having to retry if you fail. There's a chapter select, so it's possible to go back and retry failed scenes, but the real drama of the game comes from trying to get it all done on one playthrough without having any characters die or do the wrong thing. Personally, I became more concerned for my success than I had in any other game simply because of this fact.The main problem I could see with the game is that, while the game's a murder mystery, you're never really given the opportunity to try and solve it per se. While you, the player, might guess at it based on clues you find, there's no part of the game that's actually about going out and getting clues. The characters investigate, but in a linear, pre-determined manner. While on the one hand I found this kind of annoying, the fact that the game has to go on no matter who dies - even if all the playable characters die - kind of balanced it out. There's simply so many scenarios already that making it open-ended on top of that would've been much more difficult.On the whole I really enjoyed Heavy Rain, primarily because of the aforementioned life-or-death struggles. However, it was only really good for one playthrough - it's not the kind of game that one really replays to find out what happened. The game is about your one story, and going back and doing it again takes away a lot of the pressure, and therefore the drama, of the game's system. It's essentially an extended movie where the player's failure can change the ending. It's worth a playthrough, but might not be worth holding onto.8/10.We purchased this game with our own money from a game store.""",4,represents an entirely new genre,2010/9/7 0:00

A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B002CZ38KA,"Richard Baker BinaryMessiah""""",1,1,"The Good: Amazing visuals, astounding and gripping story, very immersive, sounds greatThe Bad: Some glitches, can be slow at times, not the game for everyone, some control issuesHeavy Rain really shows that a game's story is important because that's the main focus of Heavy Rain. The game play is simple, but the story is so deep and complex you'll never want to put the controller down. Before you start thinking this is some awesome shooter or something it's not. Fans of Indigo Prophecy will know exactly what this game is like. The story is a murder mystery about an Origami Killer who abducts children and drowns them in rain water (thus the title) and leaves strange traces such as orchids and origami figures. You play four characters throughout the story that are trying to find one father's son (Ethan Mars who is the main character that you play) as well as a FBI agent, a journalist, and a private investigator.The game starts out very slow and takes a couple of hours to really pick up. You start out with mundane tasks like getting dressed, brushing your teeth, fetching dishes, playing with your sons. All this is done through action commands that appear on-screen near items that you use the left analog stick for. Some actions require slow movement of the stick, some use the motion sensing, and some even have you holding buttons at the same time. The game is by no means an action game. It's all about story and you control every single action the four characters do.The beauty of Heavy Rain is the fact that you can change the fate of a character without even knowing it. Miss an evidence file when investigating a scene as Norman Jayden, and something could seriously go wrong towards the end of the story. Using his ARI glasses and glove you get to virtually scan evidence files and find them. If you miss one it could turn sour towards the end of the game, or in the middle, or the very next chapter, but it all depends on you.You always want to scan everything, use every action you see, and even read every thought you can. Reading the characters' thoughts can help give you clues in a pinch especially on timed events. Some events are timed and if you don't act fast and do the right thing it could change the whole story. There are even fight scenes where you have to press the correct buttons, and if you fail too much you can kill your character, and if the character dies they're dead through the whole story.The way the game changes is fascinating, every event even the tiniest one can change the fate of a character and this has never been done in this kind of detail. The game really forces you to think about your choices since there's no extra lives, and the fact that you can't redo anything is what makes the game so exhilarating. This feels like you're playing out a movie and you're the puppeteer, but never actually messing anything up or getting involved too much to make it feel fake.The game also looks astounding. This is some of the best facial animations, and skin textures ever in a game. The game looks truly real with some of the most high-tech next-gen graphics to date. You can see every poor on a characters' face, every hair is individualized and never a flat texture. The lighting is amazing and so are the physics. This is also a true game to behold and look at, plus the voice acting is top-notch Hollywood stuff.The game does have its issues though. The controls are a bit finicky when moving the character. You have a walk button and the camera shifts often so it changes the controls on you when it does. This can be a bit frustrating during time sensitive events. Even though the action commands really put you in the game it's not for everyone. It can be really slow at times, and some people just don't like this kind of game play. There are a few technical glitches such as texture pop-up and I had the game completely lock up my system at one point. Other than this the game is excellent, it just needs a bit better pacing.The game has multiple endings and finding out what would have happened if you did or didn't do something can be very inciting to go back through again. There are a ton of trophies to unlock and some nice bonus content. So if you love stories, and pretty graphics then pick up Heavy Rain otherwise stay away.",4,Beautiful and unique.

A2A0FBLKJN4ZY5,B002CZ38KA,W. freeman,47,33,"Overall Heavy Rain really does deliver on many levels for the type of game that it is, much like a game like Indigo Prophecy it really puts you into the world of a movie rather than a game. I remember seeing about 3 years ago a piece of this game and thought wow how odd, so i didn't really know what to expect as a full game. Starting off real innovative gameplay mechanics really work sometimes other times not so much. The controls when you first start are a bit difficult and you really find yourself unsure of the purchase you just made, but work through it and it becomes, well maybe not easy but you get the hang of it. The graphics are top notch, and the story is very engrossing, i'm really not going to go into detail only that the premise is how far will you go for someone you love""? The actions of the so called oragomy killer are never really clear but all the different locations and storyline plots have many twist and turns to keep you guessing through out. The onscreen commands such as use the left analog stick to take out your enhaler, or to hit different buttons while confronting an enemy are a bit strange at first but really you have to be quick and respond if you want a certain out come. Now if you really don't care you can actually just let the game run alone and not even interfere, which is most cases you won't die, but then whats the point if you don't interact. Plus thats the whole point is making your decisions based on what you want the outcome to be. So while this sounds confusing it can be at some points, but never the less its very fun, just a different kind of game that is the Heavy Metal or games meaning its not for everyone, and won't be a huge off the shelfer, if you will. But i think its great for what it is, i finished the game in around 11 hours, so yes its like most reviewers had said, once you play it, going back to play again really doesn't seem so appealing. So thats really why i give it a 3 instead of a 5. Now mind you if this game had been a downloadable game such as Siren Blood Curse the graphics would not look nearly as good and the game files would be so enormous that you couldnt even fit it on your playstation. But i feel the game should have been 39.99 instead of 60(but hey its sony, thats not going to happen), although i didnt have to worry because i rented the game before it came out due to a friend at the video store giving me early access!! So yes rent the game i would not pay this much for the game even though for the most part it is amazing. They're are few things to left to be desired although they are few and far between. This is basically the score i give, not to add up the numbers for a final score just to tell a little bit about whats what. So if you enjoy interactive movie games than this is definitely the best out there, and there is really nothing else like it on the market.Graphics-10/10---Buries metal gear solid and killzone 2 into the ground.Gameplay-8/10---Thats a mixed bag sometimes its fun sometimes tedious, so its really a hard decision.Controls-7/10---Mostly this goes along with gameplay, so its quirky but as you go along you put up with it.Storyline-10/10---Engrossing, Sexy, Violent, Offensive, Fun, Intelligent, and the best in years.(says it all)Voice Overs-8/10---For the most part its spot on, a few areas it out of synce, some more than others.Atmosphere--9/10---Something i consider most important, and there is plenty of it here.Replay Value---4/10-Once your done i think to gamestop it will go, so its really just a rental unless you have little time to really get into the game, then by all means buy it. If you have the money, otherwise wait another 2 months when the game is 40 bucks or so, then it will be worth it.Overall-I would give the game an 7.5 even though my scores look higher. The whole reason is as a package game it really doesn't hit everything 100%, though it tries and does well its a great game for the people who will want it, what really  brings the game down a bit is little replay value if any for most. And the controls most people will find very unappealing, i myself thought it was pretty great but just can't justify the higher score i would if i could.""",3,"Fun yet frustrating, brilliant yet flawed, beautiful with some bugs.",2010/2/23 0:00
A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B002I0F5M8,S. Rhodes,4,3,"When the original Arkham Asylum came out in 2009 it more or less took the gaming world by storm.  It did so for two reasons.  The first was that before Arkham Asylum most of us couldn't remember the last time Batman was actually given a good game.  The second was that it was a very well put together game.  A game that, for the most part, is hard to follow up.  Arkham City does the original justice.  It's bigger (definitely) but most of all it retains much of the same charm.The story here is actually amusing in some ways.  The game is set one year after the events of Arkham Asylum where Warden Sharp is now the mayor.  After the events of Arkham Asylum he has moved the prisoners to a new bigger place dubbed Arkham City.  Here, the villains run around in a place where anarchy pretty much rules and somehow Batman finds himself in this madhouse.  There are a ton of villains and a ton of story to undertake.  There is a lot going on, but it's hard to say the story is quite as focused as the original game.  It's a great story and all, but one of the things you'll notice about Arkham City right off the bat is that the game just might be a little too big to handle.  It's stuffed to the brim with villains, most of whom don't get much screen time.  This makes for less development of the villains but with a cast this big, going above and beyond in character development is harder.  Some familiar faces return from Arkham Asylum as well.  Nevertheless, though the villains may not have much development they are still strangely interesting because some of them are presented to us so well.When you are traversing through the story, however, it's very well presented.  Without a doubt one of Arkham City's finest achievements is the visual spectacle of it all.  Everything is dark and gritty.  Every last detail begs you to look at it.  If there's one thing we can definitely say about Arkham City it's that it definitely pulls you into its fictional world with is amusing aesthetics and visual design.  This is made better by the voice acting throughout the story.  Certainly the game doesn't focus a little too much on the villains because there are a lot, but when you run into them they're voiced very well and the dialog is also very well written.  Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill return to reprise their roles of Batman and the Joker respectively.  If you enjoyed the animated television series of the 90's you're more likely to enjoy Arkham City's overall presentation and story.Batman Arkham City doesn't play too terribly different from Arkham Asylum.  When in combat it can, at times feel like a button masher.  You'll be able to string together long combos along with performing takedowns or counters to deliver the pain on your enemies.  You'll also gain experience which you can use to level up and learn skills.  If it were all about button mashing to get through the game, however, it wouldn't be quite as engaging in other ways.Like Arkham Asylum before it, you can put on detective mode to learn more about your enemies in the area.  This will allow you to see through walls, pinpoint enemies holding weapons or those who may be panicked... or even just using the mechanic to find secrets.  And it is very easy to be sidetracked in Arkham City because not only is there the main story, but there are also side quests, Riddler tropies and riddles to solve as well.  It is very possible to go through Arkham City and still have a lot of the game left to explore.  The only real downside to detective mode is that you won't be able to admire the games visual presentation if you keep it on throughout the experience.  And most players will find that detective mode is a very useful way to play the game as is.There are, of course, other ways you can feel like Batman.  As you go through the game you'll also find several gadgets, but more importantly certain areas have other means to go about them.  Like Asylum, you can perform glide kicks, stealth takedowns and zipline across the level or use your grapple.  There's a lot you can do but the way it all comes together is simple enough so that the player doesn't feel overwhelmed.  There are even moments where the game puts a large emphasis on a strategic takedown of your enemies as opposed to always just dropping in and kicking butt.  So even if you saw Arkham City as a button masher, it isn't likely to get you through the game anyway in areas where say... all the bad guys are using guns.  Thanks to these moments as well as the gadgets and various amounts of villains there is a lot of variety here.  The boss encounters you find yourself in are among the most unique in the game.  For example, the encounter with Mr. Freeze puts you in the position of finding out various takedowns for him... but the same one will rarely work twice because he learns from his mistakes.  Arkham City isn't exactly an easy game either.  If you somehow manage to mess up, the game is always willing to provide you hints and help you out.Arkham Asylum was a hard game to follow up.  Mostly because it showed us how a Batman game should be done.  Batman Arkham City is just as good.  In some ways it's better.  It's a lot of fun to play, has an amusing story, but most of all there's just a lot to do.  Many a gamer will no doubt stumble through Arkham City and still leave a lot of ground uncovered.  There's a lot of replay here... and a lot of exploring to do.  The game is bigger and better but in a careful manner.  It primarily keeps true to the things which worked so well in Arkham Asylum.  If you played Arkham Asylum and enjoyed it, then Arkham City really does prove to be a worthy follow up.",5,The Dark Knight Returns,2011/10/24 0:00
A2582KMXLK2P06,B002I092MM,B. E Jackson,2,1,"My main complaint with Super Mario 3D Land is... what's new?  After Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2, this game comes up drastically short in comparison.  I mean does this game do *anything* better than the Galaxy series?  I can't help but feel the majority of these levels (at least 85% of them) are WAY too easy.  Trust me, if you've ever thoroughly explored the Super Mario Galaxy series, this game offers nothing original, creative or worth replaying a second time.  Many of these stages feel designed for people who've never experienced Mario in a 3D environment and desire something simplistic to get their feet wet, so to speak.That's not to say the game is bad mind you (I *do* believe a 3-star rating is above average after all).  I admire the updated Boom Boom fights.  Let's be honest, when they first appeared in Super Mario Bros. 3 they were WAY too pathetically easy.  Stomp on Boom Boom's head 3 times and he's done.  Now -in a 3D environment- he's more dangerous, though only slightly (again, the game is easy for the most part).  The overabundant green platforms in this game are similar to the ones you found in the Galaxy series.  In fact some of these stages look directly stolen from Yoshi's Star Galaxy (SMG2 level) with the piranha plants, goombas and exceptionally colorful environments.I suppose I shouldn't have raised my expectations so high going into the game.  It's a 3DS game and not meant to be in the same category as a Nintendo Wii game or other high profile video game console.  To be positive for a moment, fighting Bowser is extremely fun, fast-moving and challenging (the one circumstance when you will probably lose several lives).  Not a bad game and in fact, let's say Super Mario 3D Land is basically Galaxy Junior.  This game can be finished in a few hours and that's just unacceptable in todays world.",3,it's Mario,2013/1/15 0:00
A36UKFV79879MD,B002I092MM,BX Lounger,0,0,"In 2011, shortly after Nintendo released the much hyped, anticipated (and problem plagued) 3DS handheld system, they released Super Mario 3D Land. While staying true to its roots and keeping the familiar game play many fans love, it's updated for modern times and utilizes the 3D"" filter. It's a blast to play and will keep you playing until you've unlocked everything.The story is still the same: Princess Toadstool gets kidnapped by Bowser and Mario rushes off to rescue her. You go through 8 worlds and multiple stages including Boo Houses, mini castles and various air ships controlled by Bowser and his allies. Controlling Mario is easy as he has all his trademark moves from past games. Familiar and new power ups are featured here as well as the infamous ""infinite power"" leaf which makes you invincible and only shows up if you die a certain number of times in any stage. Once you beat all the stages, you unlock the ""Special"" stages; essentially they are alternate versions of the original stages (some have entirely new layouts while others have a few variations here and there and feature new obstacles.) As usual, the game has three save slots so you and other people can save their respective game sessions.This time around, you can unlock Luigi as a playable character and you also get star ratings. They pop up to show you how well you are doing and you can up to 5 stars; get a 5 star rating and you unlock another ""secret"" section of the game. Don't worry if you think this game is a piece of cake; it starts off easy but by the third world, the challenge ramps up and you will be put to the test as far as getting all the star coins, unlocking secret sections, etc. This game uses the StreetPass feature to encourage gamers to walk around with their 3DS systems. It does so by having ""?"" block challenges within the game. These challenges basically have you clear out enemies and/or grab token coins within a time limit; doing so lets you collect these coins to unlock stages as you get further into the game and also sends out this info to other gamers who have this game to challenge them to do the same.The PROS: The graphics are great. Everything from the enemies to the backgrounds and the effects of everything you see on the screen looks beautiful. The music and sounds are familiar but updated slightly while controlling Mario is as easy as it's always been. It starts out easy but this game will challenge you, especially if you're the type that wants to unlock and complete everything this game has to offer. There are plenty of stages to complete with more to unlock along the way, unlocking Luigi proves to be useful as you need to use him to clear stages (sometimes he makes it easier to do so than Mario) and getting the 5 star rating unlocks more stuff so it is worth going the extra mile. The StreetPass feature this game uses is cool as it makes you want to carry your 3DS around to see if other players send you ""?' block challenges. The same goes for power ups; whenever you go to Toad's house to get power ups, your 3Ds sends out that info to other games so when you come back later, you'll see that another gamer has sent you power ups to use in the game.The CONS: None. If you don't like Mario, this game won't change your mind but then again....maybe it would. :PThis game is sold separately and as part of a bundle (Flame Red 3DS with a copy of this game) so you have a choice of how to get it. Those who are still on the fence should definitely consider buying this game. It's a lot of fun to play, looks great and it also gives you a challenge. I highly recommend it so go for it!""",5,Mario's 3DS debut is a blast,2012/8/24 0:00
A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B002I092MM,"Christopher Barrett Evil Corgi""""",1,1,"In Super Mario 3D Land (called SM3D from here out), you control Mario or Luigi on their adventures to save Princess Peach (aka Toadstool) from Bowser (aka King Koopa).  I liked the 3D format for this game, but it really looked like the developers spent a lot of time and effort on the 3D and hence, sculpting worlds that really showcased the technology.  Not a bad thing really!  You bought a 3DS because you wanted some flashy 3D right?  The only drawback is that this game plays like a meshing of Super Mario 64 (my favorite Mario game of all time), Super Mario World, and Super Mario Brothers 1 and 3.  Not a bad mix, but it seems that the depth is what I find lacking.You get 8 worlds (at first) with 4 stages in each.  So like the old school NES games you have 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, and so on.  Plus a castle.  Plus a few bonus stages (that are usually Toad Houses, or mini games).  So you have 40 stages initially.  Not bad.  But then you can replay the 'Special Worlds', which sound really cool (like Super Mario World's Star World), but they are just tougher versions of the original 8.  You can play the special worlds out of order as well, but not the original 8.The game does play like Super Mario 64 except that the stages are more linear and there is a timer.  I would have enjoyed a more open style of game much more like Super Mario 64 of Super Mario Galaxy, and had Nintendo stick with the old school format for New Super Mario Brothers.  That's where I get conflicted of course.The gameplay is sometimes a bit wonky.  Controls can sometimes be sluggish or sticky, the characters do seem to have a bit more forward momentum so that you end up sliding into chasms pretty often.  And with the view point mostly stationary (you can switch views slightly with the touch pad) you don't really get the 'big picture' feel.  The camera basically points you in the direction you need to go.The challenge is medium, even in the later stages, but often the game can either be cake walk easy or frustratingly difficult.  Once you get the hang of things though, it becomes very easy.  The main challenge is in collecting all of the Star coins.  But as a completist, I liked getting more extras such as the myriad extras to collect in Super Mario World 2, or collecting all of the stars in SM64 or even unlocking all of the extras in both New Super Mario games.So my bottom line?  Buy it! As a youth, I cut my video game teeth on the original Super Mario Brothers game, so it is with open arms I welcome this great, retro style action game.  I look forward to a more 'adventure' style Super Mario title with more in common with Mario 64 and Mario Galaxy.  Fingers crossed.",5,"A great title, but still not quite what I was looking for ~",2012/12/14 0:00
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B002I092MM,"Michael Kerner Michael Kerner""""",72,62,"There is no question about Mario. He has not only been the most influential video game character of all time, but has had honestly the most definitive impact on how we play great platform games that have never lost their luster. Over 25 years after Super Mario Brothers debuted, people still love to go for the flag, and try to knock Bowser off his perch all to save Princess Toadstool from the claws of the king. The game franchise has never honestly gotten old, and has stayed just as strong today for every Nintendo era. The last Mario platformer for the go handheld was New Super Mario Brothers for the Nintendo DS. It really was fun and entertaining for the DS, and Mario's Wii games like Super Mario Galaxy have changed the way we play with Mario in zero gravity. But now with the Nintendo 3DS which came out just last Spring, they haven't yet had a definitive Mario platformer. Well, they are about to have one now, and a little treat for the fans young and old of the past 25 years too.Super Mario 3D Land, is a new and exciting Mario game that still shows how amazing the Mario games have never gotten old. The game brings in a new twist on the classic 2D platformers by bringing back some of the amazement from the classic Super Mario Brothers 3. Just like what New Super Mario Bros. Wii did by bringing back the forgotten Koopa kids and giving them a hard-hitting challenge against Mario. This time it is the beloved tanooki racoon suit returning to the mix from Mario 3 returns, as shown in the story of the game, as well as the classic foe Boom-Boom. As Bowser not only captures Peach, but steals a bunch of tanooki leaves giving Bowser, and his cohorts tanooki powers to try and stop Mario from his wrath on the Mushroom Kingdom. It is challenging as characters like the classic goomba and Boo now can go against Mario with tanooki racoon tails to try and swat you. But that isn't just it alone, Mario also has new elements of power at his side too: including the tanooki leaf, the classic mushroom, as well as the new Boomerang power-up, which Mario can throw boomerangs at his foes and they will come back to him at his side, just like the classic Boomerang Brothers from Super Mario 3.The gameplay takes all the elements from the classic Mario games in both 2D and 3D like Super Mario 64, and giving them a 3D twist by having you race against the clock trying to make it to the goal before time runs out. There are also classic items to be found including the bonus coins, and warp pipes, as well as a few new treats as well. The gameplay is very addictive from start to finish, and has shown that they haven't gotten old. The controls are also very simple and easy to master on each level, as you leap from block to block, and hopping in pipe to pipe, all trying to make your way to the goal. The sound is also classic Mario as well, by not getting old, and remaining distinctive as before. It takes timing and a lot of guts to master this new adventure, but honestly die hard Mario fans will definitive love this new challenge, as well as new ones too.All in all, Super Mario 3D Land is a definite must buy game for the Nintendo 3DS. It truly has shown that no matter what the gaming universe has to come around, Mario has still been a great constant in the gaming universe that continues to evolve and be just as fun today as it did back then. I definitely love the challenge this game has, and I know this will be a great game for you to play on the Nintendo 3DS (and only available on the Nintendo 3DS.) There haven't been a lot of definitive games for the Nintendo 3DS since last Spring, but this is definitely one of them that I absolutely recommend.Graphics: A-Sound: A-Control: AFun & Enjoyment: AOverall: A-",5,Mario Mania,2011/11/13 0:00
A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B002I092MM,"Richard Baker BinaryMessiah""""",1,0,"The Good: Great graphics and 3D effects, solid platforming and gameplay, variety of levelsThe Bad: Same tired NSMB/Galaxy formula, only three different abilities, 70% of the game is too easy, the last 30% is way too hard, bosses lack variety, 3D effects don't enhance gameplay, star coins offer no reward, no extra modesHere we are again. Another Mario game to prove how good a new Nintendo system is. Super Mario 3D Land is another addition to the New Super Mario Bros./Galaxy formula that pushed Mario into a new generation. Honestly, I'm tired of it, but it still proves to be solid and entertaining.The game has 8 worlds to play through and each stage is completely different, so at least there's variety. Each world feels like a mini one from Super Mario Galaxy mixed with a New Super Mario Bros. level. The whole point is to just get to the end, but there are 3 star coins in each level. Here's the problem with collecting all those: There's absolutely no reward for doing so, it's just to scratch the completionist OCD itch. Mario has his usual NSMB abilities like the fire flower, Tanooki suit, Boomerange suit, and the white Tanooki suit. Honestly, the game lacked any new abilities which is a shame. I found that the Tanooki suit was vital to winning some levels and to even get to some star coins.At the end of each world you fight Bowser, but there's not variety to it. You work your way up to him then you just avoid his attacks until you get to the button that knocks him into lava. Every so often you will fight Bowser Jr. or the Koopa Twins, but they are all very easy. Speaking of easy, the first 6 worlds are a breeze with nearly zero challenge. The enemies are easy to avoid, and if you die more than 5 times you get the White Tanooki suit which makes you invincible through the whole level, they basically just let you cheat your way through. I really hated this, but at the last world I found that I needed it because the game went from super easy to extremely difficult in no time flat. It took over an hour to beat the final Bowser level.The 3D effects are pretty nice and work well here. There are a few instances in levels where 3D will benefit you to see the level layout better, but just like most 3DS games, it's just for flash, and not gameplay. I did find the graphics to look crisp and very pretty for a  3DS game, but they still look like Super Mario Galaxy and haven't changed one bit, I'm bored of it. There are no extra modes, and once you beat the game it's hard to have a reason to come back. The story in Mario games is pretty simple so I won't even go there.The severe lack of challenge throught 70% of the game just really brings the experience down. Enemies are a breeze to avoid and there's just nothing new to the overall Mario formula to make it groundbreaking like Mario used to be. Nintendo has been riding this formula for so long that it's a wonder people keep buying it. I thought this would be kind of like Mario 64 in a sense that it revolutionized the genre and console, this game had that potential. While the game is just plain fun, I wanted a challenge. I wanted something new like more abilities, a new art style, new enemies, and just a larger challenge. When you hit world 7 you will be in for a world of hurt because the game is just so damn hard. It's the way the level are laid out, enemies are placed in tricky spots, but it's not the fair type of hard.Overall, Super Mario 3D Land is a fun game, but not the genre changer like everyone thought. It sticks with the same tired NSMB/Galaxy formula that everyone is getting tired of. There's not challenge 70% through the game and the bosses lack any variety. There's no extra modes and the star coins offer no reward. What we have is just a fun Mario game with great graphics and 3D effects, that's all.",4,"A lot of fun, but way too easy.

A2TCG2HV1VJP6V,B002I092MM,Ryan Sil. (Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...,1,1,"It's amazing how when Nintendo makes a Mario game, it would turn out well. There's no bad Mario game that Nintendo has ever created! But have you ever noticed that other than Super Mario 64 DS (Which is a remake), there's no original 3D main Mario game on a portable system? Well, now that Super Mario 3D Land has arrived, I can easily say that this is the best 3DS game by far.Don't let the videos fool you. The game is incredibly fun, like any other Mario game. While the environments aren't as wide to roam around as games like Mario 64 or Mario Sunshine, they still triumph in level design and enemy/obstacle variety (Goombas on top of each other, floors that flip when jumping, etc). The game also feels a bit like a combination of New Super Mario Bros, Mario 3, and Mario 64.The power-ups are also very handy. The Tanooki Suit, while you can't fly anymore (Sad face...), you can still flutter and whack enemies with your tail, making for some very fun platforming moments. The Boomerang Suit and Propeller Suit also adds to the fun, as you can hit enemies with boomerangs and be able to fly upward for a bit, respectively.The graphics are extremely colorful and crisp. The 3D makes it look all the more better. The music is not unlike the other Mario games, yet some tunes are all-new and manage to fit well with the existing ones!At first, the game would seem fairly short, as it appears to be only 8 Worlds long with about 5 levels in each. Fortunately, it turns out that there's much more to it. You would actually have to go find Star Medals (Which are somewhat like Yoshi Coins in Super Mario World) in order to unlock certain levels (50 Star Medals for World 5's castle level). Furthermore, special levels are unlocked once beating the 8 worlds. It's surprisingly long when you want to do everything.But overall, this is a very awesome game, and it is definitely up there with the other greats Mario has to offer.",5,How does Nintendo do it?,2011/12/30 0:00
A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B002I092MM,S. Rhodes,49,41,"Back in the days of the original Gameboy, the Super Mario Lands were hailed for being relatively different from the usual Mario experience.  Sure you were still stomping and such, but you faced wildly different enemies and got some very different power ups.  Super Mario 3D Land is not a sequel to those games in anyway.  But like the Super Mario Land games, it takes a different approach to the Mario formula while keeping in sync with what has made it successful.  Here the change is mostly the fact that it plays like the 2D side scrolling games in a 3D world.  And for the most part it actually works.Mario has never been a game anyone has picked up for story.  We all know what it's about.  Princess Peach has been kidnapped by Bowser and it's up to Mario to go and save her once more.  It's pretty standard stuff.  As mentioned earlier it harkens back to the 2D Mario games in a way.  There's a straightforward overworld map to go through and you'll begin in level 1-1 before moving on to 1-2 etc.  At the end of each world is either a castle or an airship with a boss waiting in wait.  It seems traditional all around and like it offers up absolutely nothing until you're actually playing the levels themselves.  For a handheld game, 3D Land offers players quite a bit to experience.The levels here are well designed.  Each one ends when you find the flagpole at the end, but getting there isn't always an easy feat.  You can roam around in full 3D instead of side scrolling.  For the most part you can roam just about anywhere.  Throughout each level there are a lot of hidden goodies as well.  There are blocks that house powerups and plenty of enemies to stomp, but each level also has little goodies hidden off the beaten path.  There are secret 1UP mushrooms and hidden areas to explore in just about every level.  Each level is also uniquely different from the previous one.  The game often throws new challenges at you to keep you on your toes.The stages themselves are pretty short, however.  This is obviously due to it being a handheld and being on the go.  But there is usually reason to go back and play each one.  Like New Super Mario Bros. Wii, there are three Star Coins in each level.  For players who want to experience everything that Super Mario 3D Land has to offer, you'll want them as they unlock challenging levels later in the game.Mario 3D Land also uses the suit system found in Super Mario Bros. 3.  For the most part there's fire Mario and Tanooki Mario, but there are times when you'll find something to help Mario out in different ways.  For example, Mario can now find a powerup that allows him to throw boomerangs.  Much like the 2D games, Mario doesn't have a health meter or anything like that.  Rather it's done based on his power ups.  Taking one hit makes him lose his power, a second makes him small and a third does him in.  Super Mario 3D Land isn't a terribly hard game, but if you happen to fail too many times the game is more than willing to help you out by either giving suit that makes you invincible or by skipping it out right.  While this may seem like handholding, those who go about it this way will literally miss out on half the game by doing so.  As well as several secrets.  You DON'T get Star Coins by skipping a level.  On the other hand, keeping your lives in supply is rather simple.  There are 1UP mushrooms everywhere.  Each level also has a checkpoint.  Super Mario 3D Land can be challenging, but it certainly is in no hurry to punish the player.Up until now the 3D on the 3DS has seemed somewhat like a gimmick.  It isn't quite that way in Super Mario 3D Land.  While you can most certainly play through the game with the 3D off there are times when having it on will actually make a difference in the ease of play.  Certain rooms that contain Star Coins are actually puzzles where you must try and figure out the optical illusion.  With the 3D on it actually really helps.  You CAN solve these puzzle like moments without the 3D effect but it's much more difficult to do so.  The 3D is also done rather well in other ways.  Up until now a lot of 3DS games have either been obsessed with having things pop out"" at the player or making the game look more dynamic.  But here the 3D actually adds depth perception to the game itself.  Where you actually get a sense of just how far away a particular platform is or even how close an enemy in the background really is to getting to you.  It may not seem like much from the outset, but it certainly makes the 3D much more than just a gimmick here.  But the game is still enjoyable should you decide you don't want to play with the 3D on at all.In terms of visual appeal, Mario 3D Land looks absolutely amazing.  It is very similar to look and feel of Super Mario Galaxy on the Wii.  There is certainly enough here to give you a sense of what the future of technology on the 3DS can be.  There's a lot of detail to each level.  It's just easy on the eyes overall.  What may not bode well for the player all the time is the lack of control over the camera.  For the most part the camera sticks with you pretty well and moves perfectly in tune with where you are and where you need to go.  There are times, however, when the lack of being able to move the camera yourself can leave you baffled on where to go next.  It won't cause you to die much, but it will make certain platforming moments slightly more difficult simply because you aren't sure right off hand where the next platform actually is.Super Mario 3D Land doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it takes the best of the 2D games and combines them with the best of the 3D games and somehow makes it work.  The levels may be short but they're plentiful and there's a ton of replay value here.  For those dying to invest some time in a 3DS game, Super Mario 3D Land is well worth that time.""",5,Handheld Mario at Its Finest,2011/11/13 0:00

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B002I0K3CK,S. Rhodes,2,1,"It's been an incredibly long time since Nintendo actually launched one of their home consoles with a Mario game.  And yes, this was pretty much a big draw for me.  In part because I've enjoyed the New Super Mario Bros. series a great deal.  They've rekindled a nostalgic love for the side scrolling Mario adventures.  While also providing some creative levels (at least in the Wii version).  There are more creative endeavors and even a lot to keep you coming back for a while.  It's a big game, and that's actually saying a lot for a New Super Mario Bros. Game.  It's just a shame that it's going to be all too familiar to anyone who played the previous three games.If you've played just about any Mario game in the past thirty years then you know what to expect.  Bowser is up to no good again and has once more kidnapped the Princess.  His methods have gotten slightly better, at least.  Instead of kidnapping the princess and running he finally does what he never thought to do before, actually just toss Mario aside.  And that's pretty much it.  Mario has never been a game one has played for story.  It's always been about the gameplay, and thankfully New Super Mario Bros. U makes some nice improvements, in part because it's a lot more heavily inspired by Super Mario World and Super Mario Bros. 3.  Meaning you can expect some creative levels, exploration and challenge.The gameplay is going to be familiar to anyone.  You begin each level and have to run and jump your way to the end in the same manner that you've always done.  The new power up, however, is an acorn that turns Mario into a flying squirrel.  While this seems genuinely cool, it's not nearly as awesome as the first time you dawned the Tanooki suit.  You don't fly"" with this power up, however, you glide and can give yourself a boost.  Aside from that there aren't really any new power ups.  Everything else that's here you've no-doubt seen before in one of the previous three New Super Mario Bros. games.Nevertheless, the game is at least fun.  In part because it's just got some really creative level designs.  They start off simple enough but they actually grow in difficulty.  One of the things about New Super Mario Bros. is that the games have never really provided that much of a challenge.  This includes New Super Mario Bros. Wii, where the difficulty was--I'm sorry to say--overstated.  Here there actually are some genuinely challenging moments.  In part because of level design is actually quite good.  That's not to say the game is entirely challenging.  Like the previous games, New Super Mario Bros. U is a little generous with giving you tons and tons of extra lives.  No matter how many times you fail for every life you lose you'll probably gain two or three in a short amount of time.  You'll never have to worry about seeing the game over screen.The game also supports multiplayer.  Up to five people can play.  Four can control Mario, Luigi and two of the Toad characters while the fifth uses the tablet to provide blocks for the other players to jump on.  While this is well and good the same problems with multiplayer still plague New Super Mario Bros.  While it's fun to play with friends, four players all running and jumping can still cause some problems for those wanting to actually get through the game.  It's easy to leave players behind, screw up another player's jumps by accident.  This has always been something that you can get around because there has always been this ability for other players to ""bubble"" themselves and let someone else go through all the work.  Nevertheless, I still maintain that it is much better to experience New Super Mario Bros. solo than it is to do with another person.  Likewise, the ""fifth"" player being able to plant blocks is a novel idea but it just feels tacked on as a way to show that you can do this stuff rather than for any sort of necessary purpose.  It makes a lot of the platforming easy for the people who are playing, but you never really get the feeling you ""need"" it at any point.Graphically, New Super Mario Bros. U... strangely doesn't look that much different from the original Wii version of the game.  While the art style is still good looking in many respects, it's strange that New Super Mario Bros. U is only a baby step above the original New Super Mario Bros. Wii.  And while it still looks good aesthetically, it definitely doesn't show off what the Wii U can do.  Likewise, the audio is pretty nice but by now it's getting kind of tiring to see New Super Mario Bros. use the same music over and over and over again, with some tunes slightly remixed.  While many games in the Mario series have remixed tunes they have, at least, provided a ton of new tunes.  Here a lot of it is just recycled.  And yes, the enemies still sometimes dance to the music.It's really the only shortcoming the New Super Mario Bros. U.  It just introduces so little to this particular brand of Mario.  When Mario jumped into third dimension on the N64 for instance, each game that came out after felt very different from the last, despite following the same formula.  They really had ways of making each experience feel fresh and new.  The New Super Mario Bros. games haven't quite reached that pinnacle yet, and it's starting to get worrisome now on its fourth outing.  The game is still a blast to play because there is so much to do.  However it is a little hard not to wonder why Nintendo didn't opt to reach higher when they clearly had the resources to do so this time around.  You will still have a lot of fun because so many of the levels are so well designed, and there is quite a bit here to keep you busy.  But considering the previous three games, there's a certain, ""by the book,"" feel to New Super Mario Bros. U.  On the other hand... it's probably the best New Super Mario Bros. game to come out thus far.  The levels are great and there are a lot of secrets, including the new challenge mode that will test any player's skill.  It's a much more complete package.Overall, if you plan on getting a Wii U, this is a game that you probably should add to your library immediately.  It's a lot of fun, despite that it's only mere baby steps ahead of previous games.""",4,Mario Leaps into HD,2012/11/22 0:00
A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B002I0EMBI,"Christopher Barrett Evil Corgi""""",0,0,"I was upset at first because they went and made the new Kid Icarus game into a shooter! But surprisingly, they made it into a proper shooter in the vein of Starfox, rather than watering down the shooting elements to make it more accessible. Bravo!A few of the points I liked were the RPG elements that made collecting items fun. There are several different weapons and items, each with their own special features. You can use weapons as ranged or melee, some as both, others as one or the other. I found the bows to be my personal favorite, but it's fun to try each stage multiple times with different weapons and items.Another great feature is the sliding difficulty bar. It's actually called 'intensity' or something. But it goes from 0 to 9, but is actually 1 to 90 since you can hit each to the tenth decimal (so 4.1 intensity or 8.4 intensity). I played through at 4 the first time and it was tough, but not impossible. Going back through (you can play each independently on replays) and hitting it up to 7 or 8 spells suicide most often. But it's not impossible. It reminds me of the crazy 007 Goldeneye unlockables (beating the second level in under 2 minutes on hard or something crazy - I remember that nightmare).There is a lot of great stat tracking as well. You have a puzzle that contains the unlocked trophies (nice). You can also fuse weapons into stronger ones. You collect hearts which may be spent shopping or bet before replaying a level in order to up the difficulty. If you want to have a cake walk, you can set the difficulty under 2 by paying hearts and play as an invincible Pit. But that's lame! Only do if you are under 12 years old or just trying to get a feel for the level. Players should play at 3.0 to 5.0 through the main story so there is some challenge.The main game is rather long. There are a lot of episodes, and each is unique. The first half is a flying section lasting less than 5 minutes where the direction and path are controlled and all you do is aim and shoot. The second half of each episode is a ground attack with free roaming travel. The controls are still using the stylus, circle pad and L button and movement can sometimes be a struggle. But with practice it gets easier. But if you play for more than a few hours your hand will hate you.I have to put this out there: This is so far, the best looking game I have played on the 3DS. I have Super Mario 3D Land, which is impressive, as well as Mario Kart 7 (also impressive). But Kid Icarus looks great. The 3D is really flashy and works well for the game play. Granted, sometimes you lose it because of the action, then you either have to get the 3DS back to the sweet spot or flip the 3D off really quickly! I found that I used less 3D on the flying portions since they can get a bit hectic.The story is fun and witty, though Pit's voice actor can sometimes get a bit tiresome (he sounds like the guy from Suikoden Tierkreis). But by the time you get to the interactions of Pandora and Palutena you will be laughing, or at least grinning. The voice over continues throughout the episode, so it does tend to overshadow the music, but it's often helpful or necessary. It also keeps the story moving while playing. Pit comments on many things What are all those red lights?"" and such. I love when the old NES sprites pop up on the bottom screen when they talk about old baddies like Pandora and Hewdraw.It's not the same as the old Kid Icarus. But it's the differences that make it a worthy follow up. Rather than re-hashing and ruining the style of the original, the developers utilized the modern technology to put a new twist on an old genre. I think it is a worthy game to the 3DS library, and a serious game of the year (2012) contender.Pros:+ Amazing graphics+ Engaging characters and story+ Massive replay value+ Lots of items, weapons, and unlockables to collect+ Great multiplayer+ Lots of funCons:- Old school shooter style a turn off for some- Steep learning curve- Hand fatigueSummary?

The only people who remember that game are probably in their 30's right now. For the new kids Uprising is a great 3DS game with length, lots of items to collect, and a few modes to keep you busy. The game looks great and seems on par with Resident Evil: Revelations graphics wise. The 3D effects are good as well, but the game doesn't come without issues.The game consists of two part: Flying and ground combat. Flying is the best part of the game because each level is different and rushing around canyons, clouds, caverns, and other locales is exhilarating and exciting. You move Kid around while shooting and can use various power-ups. Once you start playing you will notice one of the major problems - you need three hands to play the game. You control the reticle with the stylus and either the circle pad or the face buttons to move Kid around. The ground combat is more problematic because the game just needs dual sticks to really work. My hands cramped up from having to use the shoulder buttons to shoot so I could only play in short bursts.Ground combat is longer than the flying which is disappointing. Moving around and shooting just isn't as fun as flying, but each of the 22 levels has a boss fight at the end. Thankfully the game is as hard as you make it because before each level you can increase or decrease the difficulty to earn more hearts. Hearts are used to buy weapons and upgrade them. Of course there are hidden areas in each level that has new weapons or healing items. Be careful though, you get three recovery spheres at the start of the level and that's it so higher difficulties are extremely tough.There's a co-op mode which is fun, but gathering the items and replaying the levels is really for hardcore fans only. There's a lot of rewards for finding items and completing certain objectives like number of enemies killed, so there's enough content here for any type of gamer. I just feel the game gets too repetitive after a while because the levels follow the same pattern of flying, ground combat, boss. Sure they are all different, but I would have liked to see some mini-games or levels that are all flying, all ground combat, or just one big boss level.Overall, Kid Icarus: Uprising is a beautiful game with lots of content, but has a repetitious pattern. The voice acting is sketchy at best, and even the story is pretty much yawn worthy. The 3D effects are great, but the biggest problem here is the controls. We either need three hands or dual sticks so expect some hand cramping often.",4,"A super fun game, but you need three hands to control it",2012/8/3 0:00

The last time we got a Kid Icarus game was on the original Gameboy way back in 1991.  With over two decades and several consoles since then, can Kid Icarus even hope to survive in this day and age?  The Answer is yes.  It needed to be reinvented but that's to be expected after bypassing so much advancement in gaming.  If you can get a grip on the controlsThere isn't much of a story to Kid Icarus Uprising.  Medusa has come back after her last defeat and it's up to Pit, by order and assistance of Palutena to stop her.  Palutena guides Pit to various locations and dungeons to defeat the followers of Medusa.  It's a basic plot and story.  What really makes it come alive, however, are the characters.  Pit and Palutena go back and forth in such a natural way you understand their relationship.  Even more than that, the game is filled to the brim with jokes and some witty dialog.  The game's story doesn't take itself too seriously.  The characters dialog reminds us, constantly, that we've been through this song and dance before.  So they spend more time joking with one another and making comments.  Some of them going so far as to break the fourth wall.  In one dungeon, for instance, Pit remarks that when he sees a chest he HAS to open it while his partner during this moment remarks, We'll see how long you last with that strategy,"" right as they get ambushed.  It's fun stuff and it's entertaining to watch.  And you'll find some moments that'll genuinely make you laugh.  It's partially because of the cartoonlike feeling of it all, but a lot of it is also because Pit just happens to be likable.  It's enough to keep you entertained.Where Kid Icarus succeeds, and might confuse people slightly is the gameplay.  It's going to take some time to get adjusted to. The game is divided into chapters.  Each chapter begins with an on-rails shooter segment as Palutena guides you to your destination.  This is an on-rails shooter.  All your aiming is done by moving the stylus along the bottom screen as your reticle moves across the top screen and aims at enemies.  If you played Metroid Prime Hunters on the original DS, it's a similar experience.  It's actually rather simple to do.  You'll move Pit across the screen using the circle pad and you'll fire with L.  It's a lot simpler than it appears.  The on-rails shooters are simple to learn and surprisingly addictive and fun.  It's frantic and cluttered but never too much.  If you're playing with the 3D on, it looks absolutely astonishing at this moment.When you're actually in the dungeon crawling moments it gets to be a bit more complex.  You'll move the stylus on the bottom screen to not only aim, but to also turn Pit.  You'll use the circle pad to move forward, backward and strafe.  In the heat of combat this can be difficult to really do.  It's just as cluttered but with the added bonus of having to cover your back the learning curve during these moments can be steep.  As you go through each dungeon there are also chests to open and items to grab.  Each one also ends with a boss.  None of the levels are too terribly long, and they're not too difficult either (although you can always adjust the difficulty before each chapter).  The controls will take some time to get used to and they'll like screw you up.  The controls may also give you hand cramps from time to time.  The game, luckily comes with a stand to put your 3DS on and play like that.  It's not bad if you're sitting down at a table.  It's not necessary, but it helps.There are moments where the controls may not always be in your favor.  They can feel clunky at times.  When you really get them down, they click and the experience is enjoyable.  It might take some time, but they do come together.  There are ways in which Nintendo remedies this.  The first and most useful for newcomers is that there is an aim assistance and even an auto-fire option for players.  You can also adjust the sensitivity to anyway you want.  Likewise, there is also a practice mode to actually practice the controls.  It might've been nice to have different control options.  And even buying the Circle Pad Pro isn't going to allow for the familiar third person aiming you might expect.  Luckily, the game itself isn't hard on the default setting.  You can make it more challenging, and in most cases you might want to.  Increasing the difficulty can lead to new areas in a chapter to uncover more secrets.Throughout the experience you'll find lots of treasures, pick up lots of items and collect hearts.  Pit will begin with a basic weapon, but can collect more and change his weapon between chapters.  There is also the ""Treasure Hunt,"" which are designated challenges to uncover certain tiles on a grid that eventually reveal a picture.  These are challenges such as clearing a chapter in a certain amount of time or defeating certain enemies.  There are a lot of them and the rewards can be as miniscule as hearts... while others can be powers that you can use in combat.The overall experience of the game isn't bad.  It's frantic and fast paced.  It's going to keep you on your toes.  And when you finally get the controls down everything about begins to flow smoothly.  The game can also keep you busy for a bit.  Getting through the campaign itself is likely to only take you a dozen hours or so.  However, replaying to do all the challenges or discover all the hidden secrets can keep you coming back.  The replay value of many of the chapters is rather high.Production wise, Kid Icarus Uprising looks fantastic.  It is easily one of the 3DS's best looking games out there.  The 3D is amazing, especially in the levels in which you fly.  It's amazing stuff.  But like so many 3DS titles out there, there isn't really a reason to put the 3D on.  It enhances the visuals, sure, but it's not needed to enjoy the game, and after a while you'll likely turn it off anyway.  The cartoon like look of the game works rather well for the system.  In particular, some of your enemies are well detailed.  And for those who recall seeing Metroids in the original NES game... they make another cameo here.  It's definitely out of place, but it's a nice little easter egg nonetheless.  The audio also stands tall.  The voice acting is surprisingly competent and well delivered.  It makes for not only a good looking game, but a great sounding one at that.  The music is also incredible.  Most of it compliments the frantic nature of the levels.The only thing that keeps the game down are the controls.  When they come together they're great, but it's a wonder if they'll come together for all players.  And it can really make the difference in your enjoyment of the game.  It can even be a turn off for players overall. The fact that there is no way to change them compounds this.  Practice can make perfect, but it's certainly not a control scheme that could possibly appeal to everyone.Kid Icarus: Uprising is a pretty good experience.  The only thing that really keeps it from being as fantastic as it could be is that the learning curve takes some time.  Aside from that the game doesn't really have too much that holds it down.  Yes, it might take a moment to learn, but once you do everything flows really well.  It's not the same Kid Icarus it was over twenty years ago, but the return works rather well.  At this point, it's a curiosity just where the franchise can go from here.  It's a fine welcome back for Pit.""",5,Prepare to Meet the Light!,2012/3/24 0:00

A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B002I0EMBI,Winter,2,2,"Kid Icarus: Uprising is tremendous fun.  It is a remake of the older series of games, but this time around the Nintendo 3DS and 3DS XL give it a 3D spin that really adds to the gameplay sensation.  The idea behind Kid Icarus: Uprising is simple.  Our main character Pit is an angel who can't fly...until a friendly Goddess comes along and promises to help him get his wings to work.  The downside is, she can't keep him aloft more than 5 minutes before the power starts to overheat and he'll crash.  This makes for a perfect excuse to switch the gameplay with regularity so it doesn't get old.  You spend your flying times whooshing through the air shooting at everything that flies across your path.  There will be obstacles you need to fly through to avoid damage and there will be times you do nothing but dodge anti-air assaults from all angles.  Once you become ground-bound, you spend your time loping along shooting and close-up melee-attacking all sorts of weird monsters, many of which are the same ones who menaced you in the air.  There are platforms and 'springs' that vault you up and there are even quirky bits, like climbing into a tank and running it along the ground while shooting.While playing Kid Icarus feels a whole lot like Galaga meets After-Burner"", the 3D aspect really adds to the enjoyment.  The way the depth effects are explored gives you the sensation of peering through a window into the world, and from time to time the soaring and flying portions can be enjoyable just to watch.All is not perfect with Kid Icarus however:  gameplay involves moving the circle-pad, constantly pulling the left shoulder-button above it for your trigger, and using the other hand with the stylus to control your aim.  It's a bit disconnected, using the stylus on the bottom screen to control the crosshairs on the top screen, and using the supplied stand doesn't seem to help this much.  When things get fast and frenzied, it's hard to keep the screen perfectly level to your eyes so the 3D effects don't start to skew and double your vision.  If not for the unwieldy control scheme (or perhaps the 3D effects' unforgiving field of view), this game would be perfect.Kid Icarus: Uprising is a fun shooter with a sense of humor and an arcade feel to it.  It makes good use of the 3D environment offered by the Nintendo 3DS and 3DS XL.  It can be hard to control, but ultimately the experience is rewarding.""",4,"Classic Gameplay, Cutting-Edge 3D",2012/9/5 0:00

Joker has big plans for Armageddon in Gotham, so Batman heads over the wall to bust some heads.I liked Arkham Asylum quite a lot, but they should have went in a new direction for a sequel. Arkham City is very similar, with many of the same abilities and combat maneuvers. Even the side missions and extras are identical, but just in new locations. Arkham City itself is very dark (as expected) and as a result it's a very difficult environment to run about in. The repetitive combat gets boring about halfway though, and there's no way to level-up the force of your combat, just your defenses.Towards the end of Arkham City I just longed for it to be finished. We're two games into this particular chronology now and we have still never been able to fly around the actual Gotham, or cruise in the Batmobile, or see Wayne Manor. There is a lot about Arkham City that makes it a great video game, but I've been there and done that with Arkham Asylum and the sequel should have given us something different.There are 71 trophies but I only unlocked 50% as you need to invest about 100 hours in reaching the Platinum and one particular trophy requires a YEAR'S worth of playtime.

Both are just as much fun as when they first came out! Here's a fresh review of Arkham City, the second of the two games.Where Arkham Asylum was a fairly contained, I-know-what-to-do-next"" kind of game, Arkham City opened up the world and let you really explore. There are main missions as well as side missions, and there's more of a sense that you're really loose in a city trying your best to hold off the mob of nasties. The map is very helpful to keep you organized, and you can even tag trophies that you can see but not get to, to remember to go back and work on them later.The atmospheric graphics are just amazing. The sound, the visuals, the vocals, all meld together to give you a sense of struggling to survive in a world almost beyond redemption. This is definitely not a game for little tykes. It well deserves its Teen rating. For older gamers, this is a fantastic thing. You are delving into an adult world of chaos and despair, and only you can hold it off - if you're lucky.The stealth, fighting, swooping, head-kicking, are all phenomenal. You can feel the staggering power when a fist lands on a skull. Your take-downs feel as if you were a powerful superhero doing what has to be done.Along the way you get your level ups, upgrade your armor and weapons and toys. You have 400 riddles to track down, and in addition to your main batman story there's also a catwoman story. So there are a good range of options for all styles of gamers.If you were addicted to Arkham Asylum, you'll definitely appreciate the larger style of gameplay here and the tweaks to actions and costumes. I do want to caveat again that this is more of an open style approach. If you really enjoy the go-here-then-go-there style of gameplay, you could feel lost. Still, with all the walkthroughs on the web, it's not that you should ever really be stuck. If you *need* a hint about what to do next, it's out there.Well recommended for all action gamers that are teen and above.I purchased this game with my own funds in order to do this review.""",5,Fantastic gameplay,2012/3/8 0:00

Once again playing as the Caped Crusader, you find yourself trapped in the middle of the desolate criminal wasteland of Arkham City as it appears every single villain in Batman's extensive rogues gallery is coming out of the woodwork...and they all have their own agendas, and all want a piece of you.  Featuring Joker, Hugo Strange, Harley Quinn, Two-Face, Riddler, Zsasz, Bane, Mr. Freeze, Penguin, Calendar Man, Deadshot, and plenty more besides; you're going to be in for a very long night.  Graphics and gameplay wise, things haven't really changed much from Arkham Asylum, but they didn't really have to.  The gameplay is still smooth and the action elements are wonderful, but it's the ton of side-missions that really stick out.  Playing phone tag with Zsasz, assisting Bane (yes you read that right), figuring out the next targets of Deadshot, and plenty, plenty more besides add so much to the replayability factor that you'll keep coming back.  Add to that the amount of downloadable content, including the oh so fun Catwoman missions, really make Arkham City so spectacular.

A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B002I0F5M8,Winter,2,2,"After thoroughly enjoying Arkham Asylum, I found myself wondering how the sandbox-style"" take of its sequel Arkham City would play out.  Arkham Asylum had a fairly straightfoward storyline, and the environment changed to control how you stepped through the story:  breaking down that linearity might not go so well.I'm happy to say that this game succeeds in every way.  It makes me wonder how I settled for something as small as Arkham Asylum and I see a huge amount of replay potential as I try a variation or two in this rich open world.For those of you new to the Arkham games, the concept is this:  the first game portrayed a failed attempt to put Blackgate Prison and Arkham Asylum (the prison for the violently deranged supervillains that plague Batman's universe) together on the same island. After this colossal failure, a bizarre turn of fate leaves a flood-damaged section of Gotham walled off, filled with bad guys (and political dissidents!) who are left to fend for themselves, and the whole environment patrolled by a paramilitary security company.  What this means for you is that while there is a core storyline that needs you to go through some side stories to keep the main story moving, you are also free to tackle these challenges at your own pace.  You can spend the rest of the time wandering the environment and choosing what you want to do.This could lead to some confusion and missed opportunities, so the game gives you a bit of a knowledge boost in the form of a map, a radio, and some tie-in events.  Your map will light up all sorts of items related to the 'quests' you've picked up and will now let you tag the one you want to work on.  Your radio (and microphone in your suit's cowl) will pick up chatter as you pass through an area and you can decide to look into what you're hearing or just move on.  And last, there are times when you see a group of thugs might have one member who can be pumped for information:  if you take out his companions first and finish him last, you can get an XP bonus and a lead on the supervillain he works for.I called my review of Arkham Asylum ""The Batman Simulator"", and that's exactly what we get in Arkham City:  just about anything you've ever seen Batman do in movies and in the comics is something you'll have a chance to do here.  Unlike Arkham Asylum, you don't have to start from nothing.  You get several gadgets to begin with and more seem to come along fairly quickly.  I won't spoil all the surprises, but I'll say that some of your gadgets can be used in multiple ways:  for example, early on there is an electrical weapon that can be used to stun an opponent, to control machinery by zapping it with a charge, or to create a distraction by making a device fire up from a distance (and cause your opponents to run towards it while you lay a trap or get away).There's another new twist in Arkham City, and that's the introduction of Catwoman.  There are times you can play as her, and when you do there are secrets that only she can unlock.  There are also times where the two of them need to work cooperatively:  for example, a trophy Catwoman can pick up might be behind a wall that Batman needs to blow up with his explosive gel.  Catwoman doesn't move or fight like Batman, but the differences don't limit her greatly:  for example, she might not be able to grapple onto a roof, but she can use her whip and her claws to pull herself up, leap, and climb to the same spot just as quickly as Batman's grapple.  Her combat lacks as many gadgets, but has more elements of surprise and speed.Overall, it's as if everything in Arkham Asylum was closely examined and the game's creators figured out ways to make them better.  Clues on the map can now be tagged for later so you don't have to go searching for them again.  Your cape's glide capabilities are drastically improved, giving you more distance and the ability to do all sorts of aerial maneuvers.  Skills that you upgrade can have their 'tutorial activated', which means that when the opportunity comes to use the new skill, you'll get tips on how to do so on-screen, with suggestions like ""too soon"".  Batman has an alternate mode of viewing the environment called ""Detective Mode"" it looks sharper now, and while it has always popped up relevant information in your HUD, in Arkham City it tends to do so more when you need it instead of constantly flashing in the corner of your vision.  Catwoman has this too, in the form of her goggles (though they aren't quite as good).There are only two flaws to Arkham City that I've uncovered.  One is that there is a side story that Zsasz has gained control of the payphones and is using them to taunt you.  When a phone rings near you, you need to answer it or he will kill someone.  Then he may send you off on a mad rush to find the next phone.  These can get really annoying when they cause you to get to a destination, get a phone call, backtrack, return, get another phone call, go somewhere else, and have to come back.  They're optional, but I can't see myself skipping them.  This is a minor flaw because at a certain point the phone calls settle down and I stopped getting them for a while.The other flaw is in the 'Augmented Reality Training'.  This is an optional set of tasks you can do to get bonus items.  For example, you can improve your gliding skills by taking 5 challenges of gliding through increasingly complicated series of hoops.  Some of the maneuvers are downright tough, but you really find yourself getting better at the game's mechanics if you complete them.If you're new to the Batman games, Arkham City won't be the easiest to jump into, but you can pick it up.  Take the easier difficulty and over time you will be rewarded with a great game.  If you've already played Arkham Asylum, ""More of the Same"" is nowhere near as accurate a description as ""Better Everything.""Either way, Arkham City will be one of my favorite games for a long time to come.  Highly recommended.""",5,Grand Theft Gotham,2012/1/11 0:00

While I can appereciate the effort, given how long the original Infamous has been out, it doesn't seem necessary. This apparently also gives them the latitude to assume that everyone playing the current incarnation has no idea what was contained in the original, and allows them to repeat the entire initial game. All of the powers are repeats, with the exception of a handful of add-ons and the new elemental power that can be acquired later in the game. So you're left with the feeling that you're playing the exact same game for a second time for the majority. While I can understand that they need to allow you to continue building your character and his abilities, there were far more options than hitting the reset"" button.Also missing are the multiple factions. Rather than multiple groups competing against one another, your left with 2, and both against Cole. While it simplifies certain things and helps drive the story, its bizzare when yo reach a certain point. The Godzilla-like boss encounters are a nice deviation, but the mini-boss Conduit encounters are tedious in the extreme. Also absent are all the other Conduits, which I expected far more of given the overall storyline.Graphics are a surprising let-down. While the environments are great, especially the water-flooded bayou which is anathema to Cole, there are oceans of clipping and catchment errors. I pulled myself over a ledge and into a building several times, resulting in odd glitches and crashes without any efforts to seek them out. Probably the best portion comes with character editing, but even there its something of a misnomer, as you recieve every side quest from the same 3 people, with the exception that they wear fake mustaches and wigs that don't move in time with their faces.Audio is spot-on, but thats not really a bar anymore. Given tech, bad audio is more a rarity than decent.Gameplay is hit-and-miss. Its in true form to Infamous 1, in that there are really 3 side quests that're repeatedly repackaged and spoon-fed to you. There are a few exceptions, but sadly those writers with original ideas were apparently shouted down in favor of tedious monotony and pointless mass fight missions. The karma missions lift the bar slightly, but only just.Karma manages to be handled far better, as its more between selfishness and selflessness, so you're not devouring babies, but you're still hated for solely looking out for No. 1. And character modification is toned down slightly, so you no longer look like Darth Vader if you choose to be Infamous.Overall, a repackage, which is a shame. Given a little more freedom, this could've be handled in much better style, and without forcing you to replay the same missions over and over. Better writing, more characters, and mission design would've launched this easily to 5 stars, but its left as a mush of a good story struggling under the weight of its monotony. Slinging lightning is as fun as ever, but outside of the main story missions the game is just... boring.""",3,Infamous 2 = Infamous 1.5,2011/6/21 0:00

I am sick to death of Cole clinging like a magnet to surfaces that I don't want to touch, it makes it very hard to escape conflict or to complete race missions.

There are more likeable characters this time around, which makes the grind through the story missions more endurable. If you still have a saved game on your system from Infamous the sequel will use that save to instantly upgrade your character upon starting, which I thought was cool.If there will ever be an Infamous 3 I will give it a go, but Sucker Punch need to mix it up a little bit and fix those annoying flaws.

Let's be honest, the cut scenes in this game look AMAZING. My issue lies mainly with the fact that the in-game graphics haven't really changed in addition to the cut scene graphics. This makes the experience a bit jarring. I've never been a big fan of games that promise one look in their cut scenes and then deliver less stellar visuals as you play. I would have preferred cohesion exist between the two. Another major pitfall for me was the handling of the camera and the controls. Not only is the camera closer to your character this time around (making for a much more claustrophobic experience), but the designers have attempted to make players less responsible for you landing your jumps, etc. In short, the controls are a bit more guided. They're also very sensitive. Turn just slightly and your character jerks as though he were being pushed. It made the experience slightly disappointing when it didn't need to be. It also ended causing many unnecessary deaths as I fought for control of my character's direction. Cole's voice is noticeably different here, and you'll find yourself regaining abilities fought for in the first game without an explanation as to why you ever lost them. All in all though, these aren't deal breakers. Not by a long shot. This game has one hell of a good, cinematic storyline, the core gameplay is still intact (with some extras thrown in as well), and the large scale boss battles were beyond satisfying for me. Clearly, many people think this game is better than the first. And I can understand why they would. Mostly, I just miss the sense of flowing freedom in the controls and the camera panned out the way that it was in the first game. But even with those issues, I still thoroughly enjoyed this experience. And if you're anything like most other people who've reviewed this game, then you'll probably enjoy it even more than I did. Congratulations belong to Sucker Punch. They've got a real winner on their hands here, and have proven numerous times that they're worthy of the respect gamers bestow upon them. All they need to focus on now is not sacrificing cohesion and great control mechanics, in favor of simpler (yet less fulfilling) contols and stunning visuals which don't match the game in question.",4,For Better and For Worse,2011/10/3 0:00

Dent Aragorn""""",2255,2139,"UPDATE (November, 2010):Before you decide to buy this model, note that thePlayStation 3 160 GBand for fifty dollars more you can get thePlayStation 3 320 GB. You may also want to consider thePlayStation 3 320GB System with PlayStation Move Bundle________________________________________RATINGI will begin with the rating part so that those who are already familiar with the PS3 line may save a little time.On balance, I found the PS3 Slim or the 'PS3 120GB' to be a worthy addition to the current PS3 line. It comes with several major improvements over its predecessors and the 'trade offs' are few and, to most us, insignificant.This how the new model compares to its predecessors:PS3 SLIM vs. PS3 80/160GB+ $100/200 less+ Smaller+ More energy efficient+ More quiet operation+ Cooler+ Smaller Cell processor manufactured using a 45-nanometer manufacturing process+ New, more advanced HDMI 1.3 chipset+ Easier HDD upgrade- No Linux support- No on-off switch in the back- Push rather than touch 'On' and 'Eject' buttons- Not as pretty= Unchanged game-playing experience= Same great Blu-ray player= Same PSP integration= Same WiFi, Bluetooth built-in= Same Dualshock 3 rumble, motion sensitive controller= Same I/O optionsThe PS3 Slim is a superior product when compared with the PS3 80/160GB models. This relatively inexpensive, feature packed, versatile gaming machine, multimedia hub and outstanding Blu-ray player, earns back the 5th star that I granted the Classic models and I didn't feel that the PS3 80/160GB models deserved.Granted, when compared to the PS3 Classic, the PS3 Slim lacks PS2 compatibility, has 2 fewer USB ports and and it lacks media card slots but these shortcomings are offset by the significantly lower price, energy efficiency, larger storage and an updated CPU and HDMI. And, keeping hope alive by feeding it rumors, who knows? Sony just might add PS2 software emulation once it stops manufacturing the PS2 sometime, next year.MY TEST DRIVE IMPRESSIONSThe good news is that you can do just about everything you did with the PS3 80/160GB models and in the exact same way. During my test ride, I was able to play all the games I brought with me without a problem, the Bluetooth remote controller was recognized immediately and so was the Playstation Eye. Both a USB-dongle full-size wireless keyboard, a USB-connected wired keyboard and Sony's own Bluetooth mini-keyboard worked as expected. I was able to upload pictures, videos and music from a USB thumb drive and a USB-connected SATA 2.5 hard disk and play them in the same way I do it on my own PS3. The person who allowed me the test drive suggested that I do not sign into the PSN but I have no doubt that the Slim behaves exactly like its predecessors on the PSN, running HOME or while browsing the Net.The Slim has the exact same ports in the back, the same buttons in front - albeit 'push' buttons instead of the 'touch' buttons, the same 2 USB ports, comes with the same Dualshock 3 controller, USB cable and Composite AV cable accessories.The older PS3s weren't particularly noisy but the Slim seems to be more quiet and, after several hours of play, it didn't get as warm as my Classic. The ONLY 2 USB ports bother me a little because I brought along the Eye, a USB-wired HDD, a USB keyboard and a dongle-based wireless keyboard. That meant that I had to do a lot of plugging and unplugging when testing. In real life, it's not so convenient to charge a controller and access more than one USB-connected peripheral. There are third party generic USB hubs (ugly) or PS3-specific port extenders and media hubs that could be used to increase the number of USB ports and bring back the media card slots.My overall impression of the Slim is ""nothing new"" at least on surface. The ""cooler, quieter, smaller, more energy efficient"" you don't notice while playing a game or watching a movie. The really great news about the Slim is that so many more will be able to afford it and, with a larger user base, more developers will feel more strongly motivated to publish more, better games that all of us will enjoy.THE SLIM (PS3) vs. THE 'XBOX 360 ELITE FALL 2009'This is not meant to be a 'fan' statement. I don't own a Wii but I do own an Xbox 360 so I will be able to discuss PS3 Slim vs. Xbox 360 Elite and, hopefully, it may help a little those undecided between the two or those thinking about getting a PS3 as a second gaming console. Please be aware that, even though I own both consoles and I try to be as objective as possible, I do tend to favor the PS3.Parity------- Storage: 120 GB on both systems- CD, DVD playback: both- Bluetooth/IR: Bluetooth included with PS3, Infrared remote for Xbox- Community: PSN/Home memberships are free, Xbox Live includes free Silver membership and one-month Gold subscription, paid thereafterAdvantage PS3 Slim------------------- Blu-ray: PS3 only. Blu-ray disks aren't used for HD movie playback but to deliver games as well. Since they store several times more data than a DVD disk, PS3 games can be 'bigger' and be still delivered on one disk, eliminating the need for swapping during gameplay.- WiFi: included with PS3, available as an add-on for Xbox.- HDMI 1.3a on PS3 (more vivid colors, better sound) vs. HDMI 1.2 on Xbox- Controller: wireless on both systems, rumble on both, PS3's only is motion sensitive, rechargeable batteries built into PS3's, Xbox rechargeable battery packs available for purchase.- Integration with a handheld device: PS3 integrates with the PSP, the Xbox offers Zune integration. I would call it 'advantage PS3' because the Zune integration is limited to file transfers.- Internal power supply: yes for the Slim, a large external 'brick' for the Xbox.- Ability to upgrade the Hard Disk: the PS3 could use any cheap 2.5"" SATA on the market (a 500GB can be had for $90 at the time of this writing and the existing PS3 disk can be recycled to upgrade a laptop or as external storage) without voiding the warranty. I am not aware Xbox HDD upgrades beyond 120GB but, judging by the 120GB upgrade HDD for the smaller models, they are likely to be proprietary, more expensive solutions.- Slim comes with USB, Ethernet and Composite cables, Xbox has only Composite in the box.Advantage Xbox 360 Elite Fall 2009----------------------------------- Headset: not included with PS3 but any Bluetooth device will work, wired headset included with Xbox Elite.- Ethernet: PS3 supports Gigabit Ethernet, Xbox is limited to 100BASET-T.- USB ports: Xbox comes with 3, Slim has only 2.It seems that a PS3 Slim can be brought to parity with the Xbox 360 Elite by purchasing a Bluetooth headset (possibly for less than $10 and that would make the PS3 a superior choice since the Xbox headset is wired to the controller. For the amount, the PS3 will match and surpass Xbox feature for feature if we don't factor in exclusive Xbox games or unique Xbox Live features.To bring the Xbox 360 Elite to parity with the PS3 one would need: a WiFi adapter ($70) and rechargeable batteries ($10). I will not add the various cables to the list because, depending on setup, they may or may not be needed and PS3's Gigabit Ethernet is not likely to make a difference in anyone's gaming or movie streaming at this time. $80 would bring the Xbox closer to the PS3 but the Xbox won't support Blu-ray, does not have a motion sensitive controller, can't function without an external power supply and, Zune withstanding, it does not integrate with a hand-held gaming device. In addition, continuing the Xbox Live Gold beyond the initial month would be another $30-50 per year for the life of the Elite.I chose not to factor in the quality of available software because it's impossible to be even remotely objective when it comes to judge Sony's exclusives vs. Xbox exclusives. My guess is that, in the end, those who must have Halo will buy a Microsoft Xbox regardless of cost or other features and those who fall in love with Little Big Planet or Uncharted have no choice but a Sony PS3. The general consensus is that, at this time, the PS3 has the superior hardware (see above) while the Xbox has an advantage in exclusive titles and some exclusive content. In addition, many multiplatform games are developed on the Xbox first and then ported to the PS3. That can make the Xbox versions appear to be superior and, more importantly, the PS3 versions do not always take full advantage of PS3s superior hardware. This seems to be less the case as developers are becoming more familiar with the PS3 platform - the software gap, if there is one at this time, it is closing fast.Update on PS3 vs Xbox 360 (July 2010)-------------------------------------Quite a bit has happened since I posted this review and almost all of it was good news from a user's point of view. Microsoft got 'the message' and there is a new, slimmer, quieter Xbox with a larger but still proprietary disc and with built-in Wi-Fi, plus a proprietary Kinect port. Sony, on the other hand, has launched a premium 'pay' service on the PSN featuring Hulu 'plus' and maybe other goodies to be added in the future but the 'free' PSN service is still superior to its 'free' Xbox rival, in my view.So, revisiting the comparisons above, the PS3 still holds the advantage when it comes to Blu-ray and motion-sensitive controllers. The PS3 120GB's drive while smaller is still easily upgradeable while the Xbox is not (my 120GB Slim got its 500GB upgrade within days of purchase at almost no cost given that I was able to reuse the 120GB drive for other purposes).ESSENTIAL ADD-ONS AND ACCESSORIESFor those who decided that the PS3 Slim is what they wanted, the list below may help them budget for the extra purchases they may want to consider. There are surprisingly few extra a PS3 REALLY needs and I listed them in order from what I view as the more to the less important or needed. Those at the top are, in my view, more 'essential' than the ones at the bottom, but with the exception of the HDMI cable which is a must have for an HD TV set, you could easily do without the rest or get them later if you really feel that you want them.- HDMI CABLE - It's a must for anyone who already has an HD TV. It's not included in the box and I am not going to provide a link because there are dozens of vendors at Amazon, competing and that's a good thing because one can be had for only a few dollars. Just make sure it's HDMI 1.3. A 'High-Speed' rating is not necessarily a plus if the cable you need is only 3 ft. or 6 ft. long. All HDMI 1.3 cables should be High-Speed rated and only High-Speed cables support 1080p resolutions. At these lengths, paying a premium for 'quality' can't be justified because the odds for the digital signal to be misinterpreted are close to non-existent.- REMOTE CONTROL - Unless your HD TV supports CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) which allows for the user to command and control multiple CEC-enabled boxes with one remote control and for CEC capable devices to command and control each other,Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remotecould make the operation of the PS3 a lot easier when you are not playing a game. It's optimized for movie viewing but XMB navigation, running slide shows and shopping at the PSN store are easier with the remote control because it does not need two hands to be operated. In fact, it can be operated with one thumb.- WIRELESS HEADSET - This is the one important component that the Elite bundle includes (theirs is wired) and the PS3 does not. Any Bluetooth headset would do which is why I am not going to insert a link to Sony's product or to anyone else's.- SECOND DUALSHOCK 3 CONTROLLER - Even if you play solo only, a second controller may be charging while the other is in use.- USB PORT EXTENDER - Again, there are many competing offers. I would prefer one where the ports are powered. Some singing games may come with their own extenders.- PS3 EYE CAMERA - This is not exactly a 'must have' but it's definitely a 'very nice to have' as the Eye is not only a camera but also a stereo microphone - depending on your needs, it may eliminate the need for a headset. I obtained mine cheaply, with a used copy ofEye of Judgment. If you decide to go that route, be VERY careful and ensure that the camera is indeed included before your order.- MEDIA CARD READERS - They would plug into a USB port and will allow your PS3 to read/write to Media/Multimedia/Secure Digital, Memory Stick (PRO), Compact Flash, or XD Picture cards. They can be had for anything from $1 to $20.________________________________________________Note 1: MY OWN BIASWe own a 'Classic' 60GB PS3, currently upgraded to 320GB, DualShock 3 and complemented with various peripherals: PS3 Eye, Logitech Driving Force GT Racing Wheel, Bluetooth keyboard attachment, headset... etc. We also own an Xbox 360 Elite, 3 PSP 3000's (got 3 kids) and a second-hand DS. We used to have a PS2 but we sold it shortly after purchasing the PS3. I've helped several of my neighbors purchase, install and upgrade their own PS3's. I am posting this review because I had the opportunity to test drive a PS3 Slim for several hours a couple of nights before the official launch - someone I know works at a store that sells gaming consoles.Speaking for myself only, I tend to favor the PS3 for several reasons and here they are:- WiFi - This is a major convenience for me. I hate 'wires' and the PS3 has the WiFi built in and it's VERY easy to set up.- Blu-ray - I was an early adopter and I haven't bought 'new' DVDs in more than a year. Having the PS3 doubling up as a Blu-ray player is another major convenience for me.- HDD Storage upgrade - I don't believe that 120GB is sufficient these days and our console has exceeded the 120GB threshold already after lots of downloaded games and movies and transferring thousands of photos and songs to it. A PS3 can be easily and inexpensively upgraded to 500GB today and this is a big plus.- Little Big Planet - It's a Sony exclusive and my kids just love this game. They would probably run away and resettle with a family that has LBP if I got rid of the PS3.________________________________________________Note 2: THE SLIM'S SPECS AND FEATURES- 45nm, 7-core Cell processor CPU- RSX - Based on NV47 Chip (Nvidia GeForce 7800 Architecture) for graphics- Updated HDMI chipset (bitstreams hi-res DTS-HD, TrueHD)- 256MB XDR Main RAM and 256MB GDDR3 VRAM memory- 120GB Hard disk - 2.5"" SATA - can be replaced with any 2.5"" SATA and a compatible 500GB HDD can be had for about $90 at the time I write this review- Blu-ray 2.0 player (possibly still the best) that also plays DVDs and CDs- Ethernet 10/100/1000Base-T wired networking- WiFi 802.11 b/g (from 10 Mbps up to 54 Mbps) - wireless networking I couldn't live without- Bluetooth 2.0 for game controller, headsets, keyboards and so on- Video resolution up to 1080p- Audio supported: LPCM 7.1, Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, DTS, DTS-HD, AAC- Other outputs: HDMI, Optical, Composite AV- Other I/O: 2 High-speed USB 2.0 ports- Power: dual 120/240V- Power consumption: 250W- Weight: about 7 lbs.- Dimensions: about 12"" x 2.5"" x 12"" (my measurements)- Included controller: DUALSHOCK 3- Included cables: USB and Composite AV, power chordAdditional features:- Displays JPEG stills.- Multi-featured, surprisingly good slide show functionality.- Plays MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and MPEG-4/h.264 videos.- Bitstreams DTS-HD and Dolby TrueHD to receiver- Upconverts DVDs to 1080p over HDMI- XMB in-game access.- In-game and off-game text and voice chat (headset, keyboard or Eye are needed).- Video chat with up to six people (PlayStation Eye is required)- Can discover media servers on the home network and stream content from any DLNA-compliant device.- Web browser (still has some usability and compatibility issues) but plays YouTube well.- Google Web search.- Remote play on a PSP connected to any wireless access point - play music, videos, show pics, turn on the PS3 remotely if on stand-by- Upload PSP games purchased from the PSN Store to the PSP.- Online software updates improve PS3 functionality and keep the Blu-ray player features current.- Online third party updates.- Online gameplay.- Download and play PS3 games and demos from the PSN store.- Download and play PSOne games.- Download and play movies and shows from the PSN store.- Supports HDMI Consumer Electronic Control (HDMI-CEC) - control the Slim through the remote of any CEC-enabled TV such as a Bravia.________________________________________________Note 3: HDD UPGRADEIf you are on the upgrade path, less than $90 would buy you a 500GB drive. The one that I tested would be the500GB Scorpio Blue Mobile Sata 5400RPM 8MB 2.5INwhich replaced my laptop's 60GB drive and a friend's 80GB PS3 HDD. The nice thing about upgrading your disk is that you are also going to be left with a perfectly good 80GB or $160GB or 120GB drive which you can place into a cheap enclosure, and theStarTech AT2510U2 InfoSafe 2.5-Inch USB/SATA Hard Drive Enclosureworked for me. After I upgraded my own console to 320Gb, I used the free leftover drive as a backup device for family photos.""",5,The PS3 Reloaded [a newer model is now available],2009/8/25 0:00

Sony sadly hasn't had the sales to match with the way gamers across the country had definitely needed for their needs. While it still has had some great games like Motorstorm and Guitar Hero: World Tour, there still wasn't a whole lot there for those who simply at the time, couldn't afford to buy the PS3. Well, after a few years of desperation, Sony has decided to pull out all the stops, by reducing its price, but to enhance the way that the PS3 has made itself a influential video game system. Well, with Sony deciding to soon retire the Playstation 2, Sony has put its priorities on the PS3 full time, with not only a reintroduction, but a new sleaker version. But, is it worth its weight in what it is worth, or should Sony make more drastic measures?The newer, and simpler Sony Playstation 3, brings in all that we have enjoyed from the original PS3, but add in a bit more within the price, and the gameplay. The system offers a much bigger hard drive for its price, but has all the features from top to bottom that were enjoyed from the PS3 right out of the box, including a bigger hard drive, where you can store 120 GB of gaming from the PSN, and downloadable content and games like the simple Flower, as well as play all your favorite movies on DVD & Blu-Ray discs. The setup makes it a lot sleaker and more convient to place around your house, more than any other Blu-Ray player currently on the market. You also get to play all your favorite PS3 games like Gran Turismo 5: Epilogue, Ratchet & Clank: Tools Of Destruction, and many other greats. The setup is very easy, and fun to play. Sadly though, there are a few disadvantages with this one. The first one is that unlike the PS2 or the Nintendo Wii, it honestly isn't backwards compatable. So if you still own Playstation 2 or the original Playstation 1 games, you sadly won't be able to play them here. Also, the loading time for Blu-Ray movies takes awhile on the new PS3, because the speed of the system for those discs is very slow. But you do get very well, a whole lot for what your money is worth right now, if you simply couldn't afford the PS3 then, and waited for the price to drop.All in all, despite a few things that could've been added for the newer version of the Playstation 3, it still is a great system from start to finish. Now, that the price has dropped, it is a better time to buy the PS3 than ever before. With Blu-ay players and discs being more affordable right now, it makes the system a must have video game owner. If you've waited for the price to drop on the PS3, because you couldn't afford it 3 years ago, now is the right time to jam your heart out on Sony's PS3.Price: BGraphics: BSound: BControl: BFun & Enjoyment: BConvience: B 1/2+Overall: B",4,Playstation 3 2.0,2009/8/25 0:00
AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B002I0J4VQ,"N. Durham Big Evil""""",3,2,"I wasn't too fond of the PS3 when it was originally launched, most notably by the hefty price tag attached more than anything else.  Well, here we are three years later, and it appears that Sony may in fact finally be righting the ship with the PS3.  The new PS3 slim is what the name implies: a slimmed down, cooler, and quieter console with a 120 gig hard drive.  Other than the slimmer size and the smaller price tag, nothing much has really changed with the PS3.  Online play is still free and the Playstation Store and Playstation Home are still easy enough to navigate through, and combined with its Blu-Ray capabilities help make the PS3 the best value that its ever been.  It isn't without its drawbacks however, as Sony has continued to lose a number of its once exclusive titles, although there are a larger number of great, exclusive games still in the pipeline.  Not to mention that in terms of being an all-in-one media center, the PS3 can't hold a candle to what all XBox Live offers.  The biggest flaw of the system for me however is the fact that it isn't backwards compatable.  Now this may not be such a big deal for some, but considering that it originally was a feature during the first run of PS3 hardware, this is a serious and regrettable oversight to be sure.  Other than all that however, the slim PS3 is a sign that Sony is perhaps righting the ship in this new age console war, and who knows, perhaps they'll end up coming out on top once again.",4,Righting the ship,2009/9/3 0:00

One of the best things about the PS3 I feel other than the graphics and built-in blu-ray player is the free online availability Sony has for their customers sadly Microsoft could learn from this at least a little bit, also was the easy connection I had with the console to go online it had no problems with my router or making a easy connection online(Unlike Microsoft where if you upgraded to an N-series router you have to buy Microsofts newest adapter to go online since the old adapter wouldn't recognize WPA2 security settings).  The console is about the same weight of the xbox 360 but has one 120gb harddrive inside the console already no having to buy a harddrive separately(Microsoft), and while some people might fear this harddrive is to small you can get a bigger harddrive online to put into the console at a later date if they wish to do so.  So for people undecided on which console to get Xbox 360 or the PS3 both of which are very good regardless look no farther as the Ps3 is the same price most have already paid for the mentioned Xbox and with what you get with this incredible console a great choice..",5,After So Long Finally Bought My PS3,2010/2/8 0:00

Will it improve sales, mmm doubtful, still lots of PS3 haters out there.Same great blu-ray player-best on the market.Has a new music intro when you start up the system, (nothing major though).ConsSTILL no backwards compatibility.(Just PS1 games)No stand yet for it to be put upright, but really i like it better setting down.Does run very very hot compared to the bigger models, time will tell if it becomes an issue.Even though the new casing is nice it does feel cheap(er), great power on eject buttons feel the same.Actually thats about it, still the same system all PS3 owners know and love just smaller, a lower price, bigger drive, better HDMI output, and takes less power to run. So if you want one get it, but be fast from what i've heard these versions are to see how well it sells, but dont quote me on that, supposedly if they dont sell well, the regular 80 gig will remain, and the 160gb will stay at 399. Thats the rumor. So if your tired of lugging around the big ole boy to your friends house, get this one, its not really a lot lighter but it is thinner and less bulky. Also as i said no prints and scratches to worry about. I just wouldnt be setting anything on it, or letting it get stepped on or hit by your kids. So is the PS3 slim worth it, yep sure is, same great play, less filling.PS-The smaller the system the harder it is to cool, especially a system with 7 cell processing engines. So hopefully whatever is inside will do the trick, and i trust in sony way more than XBOX. See ya.",4,"Nice improvement, still some of the same cons though.",2009/9/1 0:00

ADLVFFE4VBT8,B002I0J5UQ,"A. Dent Aragorn""""",0,0,"One full Blu disc (or 6 Xbox DVDs eventually compressed down to 3), 21 hours of voice acting, 60 blocks of 1940's L.A. mapped and reproduced in exquisite detail, 400 actors, took several (six?) years to develop, MotionScan technology using 32 HD cameras to capture face expressions... All impressive but in the end it comes down to is it fun to play?""The short answer is: my first 8 hours of L.A. Noire sleuthing exceeded my expectations and it was hard for me to put down the controller and write this brief review - except that the kids wanted to take their turn too :). There is no consensus yet but anyone who wants to make the case that 'games' are 'art' could definitely use Dead Red Redemption and L.A. Noire to support their case. So, here is my quick overview.THE STORYWorld War 2 just ended and L.A. is in full transformation. 'The car' becomes increasingly important in an expanding city without boundaries but as the Hollywood-dominated city grows so does crime - drug trafficking, individuals all too eager to exploit the would-be actresses. Add to that thousands of recently-discharged soldiers looking for jobs and a new life and a sometimes too brutal and corrupt police force and L.A. clearly needs Cole Phelps, a Silver Star decorated war hero turned cop, determined to do the right thing and fight the crime waves.You play Cole, starting as a rookie cop, handling cases specifically assigned to you or responding to calls for help while on duty. As you and your partner solve cases - and there are 21 'main story' cases plus 40 street quests - you advance in rank and you are trusted with solving the more complex puzzles.THE WORLD AND THE INTERACTIONSYou have a choice between the 'noir' style black and white or 'colored', mostly brown and grey visuals. Either way, there is an unbelievable amount of detail and, it seems, historical accuracy when portraying the 1947ish Los Angeles. You can drive your car yourself following the accurate street map or you can ask your partner to drive to your next destination, which is the equivalent of a 'teleport'. Once at or near the crime scene or out investigating you can enter buildings, examine and file what seems to be evidence, talk to people, engage in brawls or shootouts and so forth.This is not an action game but there is quite a bit of action - shooting, fist fights, car chases - only the actual fighting is not at the core of the game. What really moves the game forward is the gathering of evidence, the questioning of suspects and your ability to solve the case based on the information you gather. The questioning part is one of the more innovative aspects because you need to decide whether you trust an answer based not only on what the suspect or the witness is saying but by examining their body language and their facial expressions because whether you see a lie for what it is has an impact on what the next steps are going to be.Whenever on foot, the game offers both audible and 'rumble' feedback when you are near of objects that you should probably examine. There's also some special scene music that tells you when you are probably done at one specific location.Driving recklessly can and does get you into accidents and you can damage the surroundings, including innocent bystanders but, as far as I can tell, that does not affect the game much.INTERACTIVITYThis is by necessity a single player game and everything is scripted so I was surprised that, from time to time, you CAN contact 'the community'. It's not often but if you have what it's called, I believe, an 'intuition point', you can use it to check what action the majority of players took in a similar situation.Then there is, of course, your interaction with Rockstar. My game came with 2 bonuses, because of my Amazon pre-order but I can't get them because the Playstation Store needs to be up for me to enter the code. I was able to get some other bonus for jointing the Rockstar Games Social Club. By the way, attempting to access the Playstation Store from within the game caused it to crash hard - had to manually turn off the PS3 because it froze and it became unresponsive.MY RATINGI've had a lot of fun playing L.A. Noire so far. Unlike some of their competition, and they know who they are, the last 2 Rockstar games this one and Red Dead Redemption are extremely original and entertaining to the point where you don't want to stop playing - and I do want to stop playing because I do have a real job and I don't want to take another day off. Also, unlike their competition products, this game did not crash (except when trying to get to the PS Store), you don't see cars floating 3 ft. above the tarmac or people walking or punching through walls. All is perfectly polished.Eight hours into it, I am nowhere near the end of the game. The first assignments were not overwhelmingly difficult but I can see how they missions are getting harder. The crime-solving part, not the combat which is only 'fun'. I hope the cases get a lot harder because I don't want this game to end too quickly. From what I've read, the main story line should take about 20 hours to complete and that should be 40-50 hours in my time. You add the side quests or street cases and it should be a substantial game.Based on what I've played so far, this is how I rate it:- GRAPHICS - 5/5 - exquisite is the proper word. As I said, you can select black an white if you want and set the proper level of brightness.- SOUND - 5/5 - you get audio clues and then there is this great atmospheric music and, if you are in the right place at the right time, you get to listen to some great jazz.- QUALITY - 5/5 - as in bug-free. It's one of the cleaner games.- ACTING - 5/5 - the characters are real actors and MotionScan's ability to show 'expressions' makes all the difference.- PLOT - 4/5 - while each case is different, there is a more or less fixed pattern: you get the case, you investigate and most of the time there is some shootout of fist fight, then you take the next case. I don't believe you can put one 'main story' case on hold and pick the next one. You can only do opportunistic 'side quests'.- WORLD - 5/5 - the rendering of a city couldn't have been done better, giving today's technology.- OPTIONS - 4/5 - you can tweak the difficulty a little by giving yourself the ability to 'skip and move forward' if you can't win a fight and you can pick between color/b&w; and brightness. Not to many other major options that I'm aware of at this time.- COMMUNITY (or multiplayer) 3/5 - you can get help from the community from time to time but it's not an essential part of the game.- NICKEL-AND-DIMING - 4/5 - can't tell how the game is going to evolve but Rockstar's ability to nickel and dime the players should be quite limited. The game menu does have a 'downloadable content' section but, this being such a highly scripted and hard do make game, I doubt that major extra content is likely to be made available soon. I have 3 free bonuses so far and the Social Club membership promises more and I hope that they stay this way - free, that is.- REPLAY VALUE - 2/5 - this is a highly scripted game, it's not likely that you are going to play it again.- RESELL VALUE - 4/5 - there are some bonuses that came in the box but they should not be missed much by the next person playing the game.L.A. Noire is a 5-star for me. I am happy we bought it and we are happily playing it._____________________________________NOTE - just in case someone didn't notice this, you get a $15 Amazon certificate if you order the game which effectively makes it a $44 game.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;""",5,Rockstar's Labor of Love,2011/5/17 0:00
A1TY4TRLA4QK5Y,B002I0J5UQ,"Brian Long Brian""""",12,7,"L.A. Noire follows Cole Phelps, badge #1247, newly minted LA detective after a few scant months as a beat trooper, before bouncing around Hollywood to the various desks of the LAPD. With a diamond reinforced stick carefully inserted, he is the shining knight the LAPD is trying to make their poster boy.As a Rockstar game, the thing you'll notice immediately is the expansive, gorgeous world htats bordering on photorealistic for 1940's Los Angeles. What'll throw you is how little you explore that massive environment. The game shuttles you from case to case, with no real exploration involved. You're led by the nose with Phelps meticulously kept notebook and the dialogue of the partners.What serves as the games flagpole is the facial features, which are photorealistic as well. You can notice facial twitches and eye movements, which start out bordering on the comical, but quickly become more subtle, which drives the interrogation of potential witnesses and suspects. Its a little frustrating trying to use evidence to catch suspects in lies, since there are often 2 or 3 options to prove a single point, but the game expects a specific one. Combined with the scene exploration mechanism makes up 95% of the game, which is tragically disappointing. While its a real set of meat and potatoes, it becomes so repetitive if the stages weren't so entertaining this would be dropping possibly to two stars.There are some chase shootout stages thrown in, which follow the normal mantra of you're constantly just far enough behind the suspect until the end of the stage, which is ridiculous when you, a WWII veteran can't catch up with a 240 lb lard ass who decides to run from the police, and still manages to pull off a fairly impressive Speedy Gonzales impression. Gun battles are a joke of pop out cover combat with obvious cover sprinkled about. Fisticuffs round out the spectrum but are also fairly ham handed.Audio is fantastic as to be expected. Dialogue is crisp and precise, and is never drowned out by the noire themed music or background chatter. The background music carries well and the delivery of the noire themed mystery movie is very well delivered.What almost detracts is the fact that this is a Rockstar game. The main character is so straight and narrow the option of being even slightly crooked isn't present. And there is so much in the way of normal gameplay and story that's left out. Where's his family that he has to protect and give more depth to the character? Where's the midnight alleyway meetings with snitches and informants? Where are the crooked cops plotting to kill you? Where's the more Dick Tracy like hands-on investigation of prints, safes, and so on? Where's the mafia? The facial recognition feature is great and gives fantastic realism, but it took up so much of the pie that there wasn't anything left to reinforce the central gameplay.Is this worth the purchase? Absolutely. A great story and brilliant new tech, along with great research and fantastic scene development make this worthwhile even at a paltry 15-ish hours of play. But if you come expecting GTA: LAPD, you will be sorely disappointed.",3,"Great, but it could've been so much more",2011/5/21 0:00

The one thing that stands out when you first play the game is the visual detail of the city and people which reaches the visual heights of another PS3 game series Uncharted,  the games environmental effects are also astounding.  I'll give you one detail,  when you drive your car in the game and accidentally or intentionally hit something like another car or whatever you can see the actual damage to the vehicle and what you hit like it was actually real.  The game also gives you multi-cases as well as the storylines main cases you have to solve and if you do them correctly you might earn your detective promotion do them wrong and well you'll get punished.  The soundtrack fits the game perfectly with the added bonus of songs from that era playing on the radios as well as nice scenery you can drive or walk through.  I don't want to get many console fanboys upset but while the video quality doesn't seem different between the PS3 and Xbox 360 I decided on the PS3 version on the one point that I wouldn't have to keep switching disc as the PS3 game version is on one blu-ray disc and the Xbox 360 is on three. It's hard to write all the things I've found enjoyable with the game all I can really say is if you're still undecided try getting a demo of the game or seeing if a friend has it because you'll be surprised at how much time you've played the game without realizing it.",5,An Incredibly Amazing Concept Game Of An Era Long Gone,2011/6/3 0:00

A2582KMXLK2P06,B002I0K3CK,B. E Jackson,3,2,"New Super Mario Bros. U is a pretty solid game both graphically and from a gameplay perspective, but I believe with this game it's honestly reached the point of being been there, done that"" quite convincingly now.  We have MORE than enough games in the New Super Mario Bros. series that it's probably time to call it quits and come up with another innovative style of Mario platforming (like the Galaxy series executed so well).While I feel sort of guilty for giving New Super Mario Bros. U a 4-star rating, the truth is, it's absolutely *fun* to play and the amount of entertainment you get from a video game is the most important aspect above everything else (including originality, as much as I hate to say it).  But seriously Nintendo, this should be the last game in the New Super Mario Bros. series.  We've seen everything the series has to offer, and it's quite obvious that showing off beautiful graphics is the main attraction of the series anyway since the platforming itself isn't *that* much different from the older Mario games.  Certainly not very challenging either even though a couple stages have a few tricky moments (a challenge created mostly from collecting the star coins located in clever spots scattered throughout several levels).  The star coins allow more bonus levels to open I believe, but I haven't gotten to that point in the game yet.  I'd say the challenge is strikingly similar to Super Mario Bros. 3 but probably not quite as consistent as that legendary game.On the flipside however, if I compare this game to the NES and Super NES Mario platformers, I can't help but be blown away at how updated the New Super Mario Bros.s series looks.  The platforms are probably slightly trickier than most of the ones from Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World even though the idea is almost exactly the same, and the graphics are so beautiful I can't help but fall in love with the game anyway.  Nintendo really went the extra mile in dazzling gamers with little details around every corner, which is why every level feels so jam-packed with goodies, because they are.  There's an abundance of coins everywhere that simply appear by either walking through hidden sections of walls or by jumping to certain areas and coins rain down from above- these are two common occurrences.  It's a really amazing experience which proves why Mario Bros. is always going to be my top platformer pick forever and ever despite being repetitive by this point.I suppose to name a few graphically pleasing parts that stand out above the rest- the purple woods in the background of the ghost house stages are absolutely *incredible* looking.  Also the colorful crystal caves in the background of another stage is a high point.  The music is memorable but nothing extraordinary.  Actually that's a compliment- quite often Mario themes annoy the crap out of me.  Not so here, thankfully.  Slightly baby-ish perhaps, but there's bigger crimes out there.  The music seems to be remixed/altered themes of previous Mario games but with a new twist, which is nice.All the familiar classic enemies return which is another benefit.  Every stage drastically stands apart from the others which provides a great deal of diversity that I appreciate.  The one water stage is my favorite- you have to avoid a giant water snake creature from persistently chasing you, which is quite the challenge.  I'm also a big fan of the ghost house stages, some of which provide mazes that encourages the player to choose the right doors to figure out the way forward or find star coins.The squirrel suit is alright, but too reminiscent of the raccoon suit from Super Mario Bros. 3.  Yoshi returns- both the rideable green Yoshi and the baby Yoshi you can carry around (first introduced in Super Mario World).  One thing that bugs me is that the game allows you to wall jump.  This means whenever you're on the verge of death, simply by clinging to the side of the wall assures you can jump up and probably reach safety.  Older games (ahem, like ME!) didn't have this luxury back in the day.  Almost feels like cheating whenever I use it.  I'd rather just fall and die and try again.  I'm also not particularly fond of the fact you can ground stomp on TOP of bricks and coin blocks.  Makes the game too easy.  The boss fights are awesome.  While essentially it's the same exact set-up as Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World (stomp on the heads of Bowser's children 3 times) these boss strategies are more elaborate compared to their older NES and Super NES battles.  Ludwig's blue-firing shooting abilities is really intense.  He's actually harder than the Bowser fight at the end (and by the way, Bowser's appearance DESCRIBES epic here- wait 'til you see him!!)Word to the wise- only play 2-player mode if your partner is experienced with the Mario series.  There's nothing more frustrating than playing with someone who doesn't know what to do.  If you play with an inexperienced player, the most effective way they can contribute is by creating colorful platforms for you to jump on and advance.  Otherwise they'll constantly get in your way and just be a great big unnecessary obstacle standing in your way (literally).To give an example- let's say you're ready to jump to a higher platform but... your partner is standing in the way, so you bump into their Luigi character which takes your focus away from the original obstacle and causes interference, which will probably result in Mario falling down the screen.  Really annoying, trust me.  Also, if your partner fails to keep up in time and sticks to the left of the screen, this will subsequently prevent YOU from moving to the right (forward) and if you're on a stage where you need to master tricky platform jumps to succeed, you'll probably end up falling down and losing a life.  Yeah, stick with 1-player mode.Otherwise, the game is fairly easy.  I had an assortment of lives (up to 70) by the time I reached the final world.  I died a few times along the way and I'm by NO means a Mario platform master or perfectionist or anything- I lose lives when I play games just like everyone else.  It's just not a very hard game.  A lack of challenge and being derivative of previous New Super Mario Bros. games are the only two reasons I'm lowering my rating to 4 stars.  Otherwise, terrific game.""",4,"fun, but it's clearly time to end this series",2013/7/14 0:00

But, if there is one thing Nintendo has showed with Mario, simply is the magic has never grown old. That has shown to be the case with any Mario game, and this no doubt is exactly the strength. When New Super Mario Brothers came out for the Nintendo DS and the Nintendo Wii, it delivered with multiplayer action, and madness as you try and save Peach from the clutches of Bowser. But with the new game, comes a new challenge as well. But this time around, is it more for its money or less than a bite from a piranha plant.New Super Mario Brothers U is a great launch title for the Nintendo Wii U, as you can play Mario or one of his friends, Luigi or Toad, in a exciting challenge to save Princess Toadstool. The game takes you on eight different levels, against Bowser and his koopalings who fly around now in fierce airships, Wendy, Roy, Ludwig, Larry, Morton, Lemmy and Iggy. Along the way Mario also encounters returning foes like Spike from Super Mario Brothers 3 and Baby Yoshi's that now can become balloons, to help you collect star coins along the way that make great appearances. There is also new power ups here too like the flying squirrel suit that can help Mario glide from platform to platform without falling down and missing power-ups. There is also a few new challenges as well including boost mode, which can help you either speed up to collect coins, or lose a life at the end, trying to make it to the flag pole.There are two ways to control Mario, with the Wii U Pad, or simply with the Wii-Mote like a NES-style control, as was the case with New Super Mario Brothers Wii. Personally, I preferred the classic NES style because it was easier to play. The graphics in the game look amazing, and the gameplay is strong, as you can challenge yourself, even by tapping the Wii U pad to add blocks to help you gather coins, and block enemies from harming you. Yet, there are a few disadvantages to the game. The first one is that if you have mastered New Super Mario Brothers Wii, you might find this game a bit too easy to play. The second of all is with the Mii-verse where players can make comments on your gameplay. It might be alright, but it can be a bit frustrating and can hinder you from making it to the goal.All in all, New Super Mario Brothers U is still a great game, and a good launch pad for the Wii U. I was honestly hoping for more to drive this game into a home run, but I basically got what I was playing all the time, fun. The game definitely is a good sequel to what made New Super Mario Brothers Wii so captivating in the first place. Yet, I was craving for much more in on the fun. Nevertheless, this is still a great game for the Wii U, and for die hard Mario fans young and old that have never gotten tired of the fun of saving the Mushroom Kingdom. If there is going to be a sequel for the game, there could be more in on the fun.Graphics: BSound: BControl: B 1/2+Fun & Enjoyment: B+ for solo play; A- for multiplayerOverall: B 1/2+",4,Mario Takes U,2012/11/18 0:00

I think the New part should have dropped off long ago. We are seeing the same formula from New Super Mario Bros./Galaxy and it hasn't changed, not one bit. There are just a few additions to accommodate the Wii U gamepad and those aren't even that impressive or necessary.If you have played games from the series you know what you're in for. This time around the game's difficult is ramped up to 11 and the addition of four player co-op can either help or break the game. The biggest addition is the Boost Mode from the gamepad user. You can see everyone on screen and can tap to lay blocks that your buddies can jump on. You can defeat enemies for them, help with bosses, stop items from running away, and even help block obstacles. This is both a blessing and a curse. With just one or two people it's easy, but with three or more you can't keep track of everyone. If you lay successful blocks you get a rainbow star which makes you invincible and you can defeat anything. A lot of times you will place a block wrong and kill everyone because Wiimote players rely on the Boost guy  a lot.It's also mindless fun, but the game's difficulty will make everyone throw their controllers. I restarted levels 20+ times because I just could not get through them. Nintendo continues to offer cheats, and the worst one yet is the Luigi demo. You can literally hit a green block and watch Luigi complete the level for you so you can move on. What kind of crap is that? Is this what we're teaching the new generation of gamers Nintendo? That games will beat themselves? Half the time I didn't care because after losing 25 lives and rotating the gamepad to friends we just couldn't beat the level.

People can post what's on their mind if they lose or beat a level and it just feels like Nintendo's version of Twitter, but 5-10 year olds can post on it so you get incomprehensible words, strange drawings, and it just feels really annoying. Of course only the gamepad player can post and see other people's posts. You can also play as your Mii which is fun, but these aren't anything that would make someone buy a Wii U. Once again, Nintendo fails to sell their consoles with their own games.The graphics really haven't changed much from the Wii, they aren't ground breaking like Mario 64 or Galaxy was. I really feel this series is now dead in the water gameplay wise. Mario just needs a serious reboot. It doesn't help that the game is overly difficult and all the new hardware features are forced and can actually make the game feel worse to play. Even the star coins are nearly impossible to get this time, and there's still no reward for getting them all. Going from level to level just made me feel dizzy with Deja vu.As it stands, NSMB U isn't a console seller, and doesn't advance the series at all. The Wii U hardware features feel forced and some times break the game. It's also the most expensive Mario game since the 64 era. $60 for a game you have played many times before isn't a bargain. If you are already tired of the series, this won't change your mind at all.""",3,Too much like bast NSB games...getting old,2013/8/16 0:00
A2TCG2HV1VJP6V,B002I0K3CK,Ryan Sil. (Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...,0,0,"I've recently become a proud owner of the Nintendo Wii U, and I'm having an absolute BLAST with it! :DI've actually started out with a good amount of games, too - this, New Super Luigi, Mario 3D World, Sonic, Donkey Kong, and the Lego Movie game. As you might expect, most of my playtime since the purchase has been mainly just with the Wii U!Huh? Oh, yeah. New Super Mario Bros. U.I was actually kinda worried about how this game would shape up ever since I witnessed the disappointment that was New Super Mario Bros. 2. The 3DS installment did not add anything new, other than the incredible dumbing down of difficulty via coins and what I like to dub the You Suck"" leaf power-up carried over from Super Mario 3D Land, a game that still kept at least some challenge.Fortunately, NSMBU did what New Super Mario Wii did and added enough elements and miscellaneous content to make it a fresh enough experience as a sequel, and also included a pretty good challenge. There are levels that I've actually died more than once on!Speaking of levels, New Super Mario Bros. U shines brightly in the level design department. The design of each and every level is easily the best I've ever experienced in a NSMB game, and a number of them feature level-specific gimmicks and/or distinct art styles that helped make them stand out from each other more.The classic 2D Mario run 'n jump gameplay is as strong as it's ever been, and with this new set of levels that previous NSMB installments wish they had, you're bound to have a lot of fun.The 4-Player co-op multiplayer is also as chaotic as it's been in New Super Mario Bros. Wii. This time around though, the bubbles players appear in after dying move much faster, so there's less trouble getting back to the action. Plus, a 5th player can use the Wii U Gamepad to plop up to 4 blocks all over the screen. He/she will either help the players reach new areas with the blocks, or screw them over by placing one atop of a player over a lava pit (I bet you that will happen).The more interesting feature in the game, however, is being able to take on groups of challenge missions that test your skill. You'll have to try dodging a Fire Bro's fireballs, fly through a Bullet Bill-filled level, finish levels quickly, etc. There's even a separate list of challenges which makes use of the Gamepad's ability to plaster blocks!I for one welcome all of these challenges. They help add to the game's replayability, which is especially cool considering that there's the usual unexplored content in the main game that you can go experience after beating it.In the end, New Super Mario Bros. U still isn't really the super-creative Mario title that the 3D games and pre-2000s 2D games have been, but the game still excels in everything else. Next 2D game I see, though, I expect something up to par with the creativity said Mario games have brought before.""",5,The best of the New Super Mario series!,2014/5/5 0:00

This game is far superior to KZ2 in almost every way, such as improved AI, solid plot/character development, high-quality visuals, balanced game pacing, great mission variety, and awesome level design. Without spoiling anything, you will get to control all kinds of vehicles/devices, which worked extremely well and added to the depth of the game.Another big enhancement from KZ2 is your AI squadmates can heal you if they are nearby, which as simple as it may seem, actually makes the game more immersive, since you find yourself sticking together to reap the benefit of a second chance"". Conversely, to help your chances of surviving a tough fight, you can also heal your squadmates if he's down.Campaign mode is not long (6-8 hours total) but it is extremely satisfying from start to finish. As mentioned previously, the pacing and variety have both been improved significantly. I am not a huge multiplayer fan but from the short time I've had with it, it seems KZ3 has sped things up a bit, which is an improvement.I have just one tip: Do yourself a favor and don't read too many reviews or look at too many videos of the game so that you can experience the full effect of the game for yourself!!I highly recommend this game to all serious FPS fans![EDIT: 3/14/2011]After spending about 20 hours playing multiplayer online, I can say that KZ3 mp ranks very high up there amongst the best mp experience I have had. After playing all COD titles and BFBC2, plus KZ2, this multiplayer really sets the new standard in terms of depth, variety, and entertainment value. Many people don't like the absence of customizable class, but I saw it as a simplification of the system that makes things that much more enjoyable. Also, the ability to ""buy"" skills after earning skill points is absolutely awesome. You no longer need to be stuck leveling up then finding out you unlocked some lame weapon or perk that you have no interest in using. Instead, you get to choose how you want to build up your skill set. You can even look ahead to see what the future unlocks are so you can plan ahead and/or save up your points for later. This seems like a small change but significantly enhances the depth and fun factor overall! With Crysis 2 just around the corner, it's going to be interesting to see how KZ3 stacks up against arguably one of the most anticipated games of the year!""",5,"An epic, definitive FPS - a complete package!",2011/3/6 0:00

A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B002I0K6DG,"Richard Baker BinaryMessiah""""",0,0,"The Good: Looks amazing, tighter controls and weapons, new weapons are awesome, jetpacks!, the story is engaging, the characters are well fleshed out, varied game play and environments, the multiplayer is super addictive and funThe Bad: Difficulty is poorly balanced, not enough multiplayer maps, doesn't do much to the core FPS game play to make it feel revolutionaryOnce you start calling out beloved franchises and threatening to kill them you will get scrutinized for it by fan boys/girls. The first Killzone (released in November of 2004) was deemed a Halo killer and was Sony's late attempt to create an FPS killer app that would dominate Halo. It failed big time due to the lack of power the PS2 had and Killzone was released with lots of slow down and didn't look nearly as good as Halo 2. It's sepia toned art style was also a turn off from Halo's colorful world. So, Killzone 2 was shown and trumped Halo 3 in a lot of ways (mainly graphics) and became PS3 owners favorite FPS.Fast forward almost 7 years from the first game and Killzone 3 is an unstoppable juggernaut and a huge technical powerhouse. Plus don't forget about the astounding multi player suite. The single player campaign has always been touch and go for some people, but I personally think Killzone 3 has the strongest single player in the series and even stacks up (or is better) than some of today's FPS single player campaigns.You play, once again, as Sevchenko and you're righting the genocidal Helghast army, but this time it's a lot more personal and the ISA are really in some trouble. After assassinating General Vasari at the end of Killzone 2 the ISA squad has to stop a new rising threat while the Helghast high council tries to use a new super weapon to wipe out Earth. It sounds clich&eacute; but the characters are engrossing, and they are more fleshed out and their personalities are deepened which makes for a more riveting story. You really feel like you're on the brink of defeat due to the constant struggle for survival. The dialog is sharp, and the set pieces are phenomenal which makes for a roller coaster campaign.You really care for the all the characters in this game since it feels like it was directed like a movie. Every scene is carefully plotted out and the action compliments it. Speaking of action that's what Killzone is all about. Shooting guns in this game feels tighter and a bit faster than the past games. The recoil has been toned down so not every weapon feels completely inaccurate which makes the game not so hard as well. The old weapons are slightly upgraded so they feel nicer to wield around, but the new weapons kick ass. The WASP is a portable mortar which homes in on enemies and if you zoom in you can use it as a one shot artillery strike. The Arc Cannon shoots green energy and makes enemies explode, so this naturally replaces the lightning gun.There are also more weapons that you can carry such as detachable turrets that you can store on your person for later. Ammo crates scattered around help you stay loaded up on ammo for your favorite guns, but being able to carry a normal weapon and a heavy is a great change. The jetpack is a new addition and it feels great to fly and works well in multi player. There are also some other parts of the campaign mixed up with vehicle sections and even a section in space! The campaign never gets boring and is constantly changing things on you and this includes environments (more on that later).Shooting overall feels better than the past games and is really fun. The guns have weight to them, but not the annoying weight where it makes the game feel slower. Aiming is a lot better since it's not as stiff as the past games as well. Killzone 3 is also heavily cover based so you can't just run and gun or you will die almost instantly. This requires strategy with the weapons you choose and I love this a lot.When it comes to looks Killzone 3 shines over any FPS out right now. Fighting the huge MAWLR at the end of the game is just jaw dropping since everything has such detail. It seems impossible for Guerrilla to have squeezed so much power out of the PS3, but it really shows here. This game just looks astounding with a ton of background detail and not just in the foreground. Everything moves, everything feels dynamic and the lighting is amazing. Killzone 3 tries to dodge the complaints about the boring"" sepia tone by adding color to the environments without ruining the art style. Fighting in snow, lots of reds and oranges and Helghan, the burning city of Pyrhhus in the beginning of the game plus not to mention all the green from the new super weapon's energy.The multi player is extremely fun and more refined this time around and the unlocking and level up system is addictive. Using points to unlock new gear keeps you coming back and the more you play the better you get like in any great FPS. The maps are very well designed and don't feel so random like they did in the past games. There are great spots for strategy and learning the maps only takes a few play throughs. Each class has its own unique abilities and you will want to try them all because not every weapon is available for every class. I never had so much fun on a PS3 FPS online than I did in Killzone 3.When it comes to 3D and the Move I couldn't test this fully, but I have tried a bit of each and I have to say the Move feels great to use, but not as tight as the controller. the 3D is also great for certain moments of the game, but other times you won't notice much. Apart from this you in for a great ride with Killzone 3 due to its varied game play (the stealth section actually works!) to the brutal melee kills that add a ""Hell Yeah!"" factor to multi player. Even being able to be healed when you die in the campaign makes the game feel fresh. Everything is tighter and even looks better than the last game, and that's worth my $60.""",5,A beautiful shooter with excellent multiplayer,2012/3/28 0:00

This was a lot of fun, although it seemed shorter than KZ2.I bought my copy elsewhere than Amazon because I had a gift card.The graphics are top-notch. I strongly suggest playing KZ2 first, as the story and the weapons will be known better to the player (although KZ2 has two very hard missions at the end.) The level designs are awesome, with the Helghast taking cover and being real pains to root out. You'll also get to use the right weapon for the job.One nice change over KZ2 is the addition of rearming depots in most of the levels. This allows the player to use the ISA weapons instead of switching to Helghast, like in KZ2. One thing I missed, however, was the statistics listing - there are no stats for the SP campaign, ah well.Overall, this was worth the price of admission.

A2U7DXDNYBBLQJ,B002I0K6DG,"Shane Windham Shane Windham, author""""",1,1,"I got this game because it has local, splitscreen co-op. That, and I heard it was a good game. Really though, that's an understatement. This game looks and plays better than most any shooter I've played. The control scheme does take a little getting used to, but you do get used to it. And that doesn't take away from the fact that the aim sensitivity is perfect, and the controls aren't glitchy in the slightest. Mostly it's the clicking of the R3 button to aim down your sights that initially makes controlling feel strange. But, as I said, you get used to it. One thing I'm really loving here is the cover system. You don't push a button and pop into cover, then push a button to pop out of cover. You hold the button to cover, and keep holding it to stay there. This aspect reminds me of Rainbow Six: Vegas 2, and I love it. It completely eliminates those moments when you pop out of cover, don't mean to, and end up dying. The weapons are also exactly up my alley. Two minutes in and I was wielding a handgun/shotgun that holds 3 rounds, instead of the standard 2. You feel the strengths and weaknesses of each weapon as you should, and the sights don't dumb down the play or blind you to your target. The enemy AI is akin to Uncharted 2, in that each enemy moves in ways that aren't always predictable and make you feel more like you're playing against a live opponent. The action is endless, and the game (while linear) normally gives you multiple routes for flanking enemies. The splitscreen play is wonderful as well. If you want a game you can sit down with a friend in the same room, on the same TV and have a blast with, both playing at the same time; this is the one I'd tell you to go with. I enjoyed the story as well. It's a bit predictable at times, but that's refreshing to me; having had so many fragmented storyline experiences in the shooters I've recently taken on. In short; this game looks great and plays great. The control scheme is going to take you a short while to adjust to. But before long you'll realize how much better the changes to the standard shooter control model has made this experience. I loved the original Killzone. The second game was pretty decent.

So that remains the same, although some of the boss fights are different and pretty impressive. This game is much better in terms of gameplay and map variety, ruins, snowy wastelands, and other strange locations give this game more pozas than the first. Aiming is much more spot on, the controls feel smoother, you definitely move faster, and the new jetpack is pretty cool with multiple guns. I like it much better than the Mech-bots in KZ2. So basically it feels like the first, just more variety. Campaign is short, not 5 hours like most have said, more like 8. This game or any game for that matter is not worth 60 bucks(my internet cost that much a month), i just had a lot of old games lying around and used store credit to get my copy, because I enjoy PS3 exclusives a lot.

I'd heard of the game, knew David Jaffe(from Twisted Metal fame) was involved with the series and knew it was a much beloved series but that was pretty much it. My interest in God of War peaked when I got to play Kratos in Mortal Kombat for the PS3. I thought Kratos was one serious b.a. in that game.  So, recently, when I was at my local videogame shop- I saw the God of War Collection. I asked the person working there to tell me about it and, when she did, I was sold. I purchased the collection right on the spot.What can I tell you about the God of War Collection? Well, like you don't already know but--, it is a remastered port of God of War and God of War II on a single blu-ray disc for the PS3; with trophies, 60fps graphics and everything is in high-definition. God of War tells the story of Kratos(an ex-Spartan warrior) who's hellbent on destroying Ares, the God of War. The story's told as a flashback of three weeks prior to where the opening movie cutscene starts and then sets the stage for the game. You fight through all manner of greek mythological creatures. Whereas in God of War, Kratos set out to kill Ares; in God of War II- Kratos sets out to alter that which no mortal or god has ever changed -- his fate. Along the way, he meets more mythological creatures out to stop him from reaching his goal. Will they stop him? Lol, you'll have to play to find out. I will tell you, it ain't pretty.If you haven't experience God of War before, like me, this is a good place to start. The games are absolutely amazing.

Ultimate satisfaction. Both God of Wars have been updated in widescreen format with slightly polished visuals for HD display and running at a lightning fast 60 FPS. If you bought the game new you will have received a code to download the God of War III demo, but as of now this code is useless since the demo is now on PSN and the game is due out in just over a week. Other than that nothing else has been changed for the PS3 except trophies which was the main drive for me to purchase these games all over again. So here is a separate review for each game.God of WarBeing released in 2004 the does feel a bit old. There are more flaws in this game than the first, but let's start with the good things. Apart from revolutionizing games and the action adventure genre single-handedly the game is amazing and epic. The game is full of huge towering bosses, waves and waves of enemies, a deep dark story full of Greek mythology, a fluid, almost perfect combat system, and boobs. Yes that's right boobs. At the time of release I had never seen a game with so much nudity before, but it shouldn't really shock gamers as much these days. The game also has some very intricate puzzles that wind up being whole levels that you have to solve such as Pandora's Temple. The combat system is pretty fast and fluid on its own.With Kratos whipping his Blades of Chaos around you feel like you have complete control over him. Another combat element that revolutionized games was quick time events. After weakening an enemy enough you pressed the corresponding button (usually circle) over them and a series of buttons flash on-screen. If you don't press it on time the enemy knocks you down and you have to start over. Of course you can just kill them normally if this gets dull for you. The best QTEs, however, are during boss fights. If just feels awesome to plow a mast through a 200 foot tall Hydra. Now you do need to realize that there is magic here as well. You get four different powers throughout the game such as Medusa's Gaze (freeze enemies), Poseidon's Rage (shock), Hade's Army (souls that continuously attack enemies). These, plus your weapons, can be upgraded by collecting red experience orbs. As you upgrade all your items you get new moves, plus increased power. If you're asking about your health and magic your can collect Phoenix Feathers and Gorgon eyes for magic and health respectively. These are all found in hidden chests throughout the game so keep an eye out.The camera is fixed so it frees up the right analog stick for dodging moves, the camera does a perfect job of following the action without any problems. Some times you can scale up walls and even fight there or on ropes. Combat is pretty much anywhere Kratos goes and this keeps things mixed up. The level's traps and puzzles are very well designed and require you to really think or be on your toes.The story is very deep and memorable. We see Kratos as a fallen Spartan leader who gives his life to Ares if he slays he Barbarian leader who is about to behead him. Ares makes Kratos his servant for eternity, but Kratos becomes a raging killer who kills the wrong people. He becomes set on a path to free the nightmares from his mind and kill Ares in the process.If I were to nitpick about what's bad about the game it's that the game looks kind of dated from today. The textures are a bit low-res and blurry, and there are some collision detection problems when jumping around. The game is also extremely difficult even on the normal setting so God mode becomes virtually impossible. The game has a decent length of about 8-10 hours, but other than that the game is great for the first outing. If you finish up the game you get to unlock hidden costumes, Challenge of the Gods, and some other hidden treasures.God of War IIIf you think the first game was epic wait until now. With visuals that surpass the first game twofold, and even more huge epic bosses God of War II became the best game to ever grace the PS2. The story follows just after the events of God of War. Kratos is still sent on a war path to avenge his nightmares and kill Zeus for killing and betraying him. He must find the Sisters of Fate and turn back time to the moment Zeus betrayed him and kill him.The combat system is slightly upgraded, but pretty much the same. It feels a bit more fluid, and we even get some more moves. The controls are a bit more refined, and we get new powers. We get some new secondary weapons such as a hammer and staff that can be upgraded. The puzzles aren't as hard as the first game, but there are a lot more of them this time around. The game also seems to be a bit harder as well with even tougher enemies. We get a new grapple hook for swinging around so this adds a lot to the game play. The game also feels more fluid and has a lot more epic moments than the first game, but most of these come towards the end of the game.While God of War II pretty much is almost like the first all the new content make it an epic and thrilling sequel. The only issues with the game is that it looks a bit dated, the game can be very tough at times as well. The game is about the same length as the first, but the game obviously feels and plays five times better than the first game. There are a great amount of extras as well as a full length making of section on the disc for God of War II.So if you think all this sounds good you can now pick the game up brand new for $30. $15 a piece for two of the best games ever made is a great bargain to me. With a separate set of trophies for each game, HD resolution, and faster FPS this is a huge package that is exploding with awesomeness.

A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B002NN7AKU,Winter,0,0,"The God of War Collection isn't a facelift for the original series:  it's more of a makeover.  The original designs and artwork were beautiful, awe-inspiring, and ambitious, but they were limited by the hardware of the PlayStation 2 and the fact that at the time, most people didn't have high-definition flat-panel TVs.  These games play exactly the same as they did on their older cousin the PS2, but for the PS3 we now have the capability of rending everything sharper and at higher resolutions.  The PS3's hardware doesn't have a hard time keeping it at a rock-solid 60fps, either, making for a very clean picture.In God of War I and II, you play Kratos, a mortal warrior of Sparta who made a deal with the Gods (of Olympus).  It all went horribly wrong, and the further Kratos goes seeking revenge, the more massive his quest becomes.  Kratos uses various weapons to accomplish his goals: as you uncover them throughout the game, you can not only choose when you wish to use a particular weapon, you also collect power orbs that allow you to make choices about how to 'level up' a weapon's capabilities.  Attacking your opponents is broken down into light"" (but fast) attacks, ""heavy"" (but slower) attacks, and the various ways you can combine them with jumps or other button presses.  Kratos can also use magic, grapple his opponents for specific combos, and gets opportunites to do serious amounts of damage or detailed finishing moves.  The action takes place in a variety of locations, including while scaling walls, climbing ropes, and more.  The God of War series is an action game that is rated 'M' for violence, gore, and some sexual situations and content.As an added bonus, this collection has online ""trophies"":  little achievements you can earn as you play.  It has all the extras my original copies of the God of War series had, only you don't have to beat the game(s) to see them:  they're right there on the menu.If you remember the original God of War games, the price makes this a worthwhile way to relive the fun, more vivid than ever, on the PS3.  If you're new to the series, you won't miss anything from the originals:  it's all here.  You'll see why this was such a successful franchise, and why God of War III was so highly anticipated.  It's a shame most PS3 units are not backwards-compatible, but this is one title that makes up for it well.""",5,Immortalized on the PS3,2010/8/9 0:00

Nevertheless, Nintendo has made the decision to expand their Classic Controller and improve it with the new Classic Controller Pro for the Wii. This new version of the classic controller has a easier grip that helps you control the games you play, whether it is a download of Super Mario 64, or playing certain Wii games that you buy that can be compatable with the controller like smashing your opponents during a match of Super Smash Brothers Brawl, or racing against others during a online race of Mario Kart Wii. While all the excitement is there, the only one major flaw Nintendo decided not to improve on is making the Classic Controller Pro compatable to the Nintendo Gamecube games that the Wii can play like The Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker.

A74TA8X5YQ7NE,B002TLTBN0,NeuroSplicer,0,0,"The Nintendo Wii is a unique console. It was never the most graphically powerful console on the market and yet it managed to offer the most fun to its users. Two factors contributed to this: brilliant games and the introduction of innovative controls. For years the rest of the market straggled to imitate the Wiimote. With mixed results.There are certain games however for which the combination of the Wiimote with the Nunchuk requires some training. It feels like a second nature after a while and you do not give it a second thought. If like me, however, you are over 35, you will welcome the feeling of a good old classic controller in your hands.Games such asMonado (aka Xenoblade Chronicles),The Conduit I&IIandRune Factory: Frontier, they all open up as a different experience when played with a classic controller.The controller plugs into the Wiimote and not the console so it is portable - but clearly not wireless which would had been preferable even if it meant a higher price. Nevertheless, this is a very ergonomically designed controller and it manages to combine the classic Nintendo feel with more modern expectations. It has the classic 4-directions cross on the left, the four action buttons on the right (A, B, X & Z) and the two octa-directional sticks (which are at the right distance not to hinder one another). Moreover, each side has two shoulder buttons (L, Zl, R & Zr) as well as the familiar from the Wiimote, Home, Select (-) and Start (+) buttons. Everything is within easy reach and works without a glitch.The controller feels just right. Heavy enough to register but not too heavy to be tiresome.

One thing I know for sure is that game controls feel MUCH better with this controller than they do with the GameCube controller. Even GameCube games feel better with this controller.

You play Monkey, a wandering nomad captured by Pyrmaid slavers. After crashing aboard ship, you are forced via a slaver headband to help Trip, a girl kidnapped from a distant town to get home, traveling through a jungle like apocalyptic hellscape called New York City,"" which is filled with predatory mechs.Graphics and sound are above average, though some of the gameplay effects, namely the color coding ability you can get for hand to hand combat render the mechs overdrawn and bizzare to look at. Environments are nice, though climbable and non climbable objects are hard to tell apart on the fly, especially in the more open areas. Otherwise, this game is very pretty to look at, and the voice acting is superb, with good, well thought out dialogue that has a good balance of drama and comedy, and they manage to work the Monkey Kings abilities in so subtly that you'd not know it if you were not familiar with the story.Gameplay is fairly basic hand to hand, with climbing and navigating puzzles sprinkled throughout. Similar to Ico, you must protect Trip from all the encountered bad guys, but Trip can at least provide distractions to help Monkey get into better position. There are even a few stealth puzzles, those these're quickly abandoned in favor of monotonous, slogging combat. After a while it becomes more an annoyance than anything else, as unkless you're jumped upon by 4 mechs simultaneously, you'll never experience any real challenge outside of boss fights, and those are bizzare in they're all run around until you're told what to do sequences, rather than dropping you into the mire and left to fend for yourself.Overall, this game is good, with a well made if left field ending, good environments and a few decent puzzles and good acting.

ADPEAVHFCNLLC,B00319DX4W,Poisoned Blade,2,2,"In the spirit of Prince of Persia and Ico, Enslaved is an epic adventure in a futuristic Garden of Eden.Concept:  9/10I didn't get this game when it first came out because I heard it was a platformer.""  This conjures images of you trying to jump across chasms, falling, and starting over.  The title of the game is Enslaved, and who really wants to be enslaved?  But I picked it up for $10 and it turned out to be a sleeper hit.Story:  10/10You play a nomad adventurer named Monkey in a futuristic world where mankind has been enslaved by a mysterious entity called Pyramid, who is armed with an army of war mechs specifically designed to hunt down and capture humans.  The story begins with Monkey waking up aboard a slave ship and a beautiful saboteur / tech genius named Trip trying to escape and blowing up the ship in the process.  The couple survives the crash and Monkey wakes up wearing a slave headband, which forces him to obey Trip.  She needs his help to return to her homeland and promises to release him once they arrive.World:  10/10This is a post apocalyptic world, but instead of ruins and dust, the planet has been overgrown with lush vegetation.  The ruins are actually beautiful.  Scattered all over the ruins are tech orbs that Monkey can use to upgrade his abilities and there are also holographic masks, that give some insight to Pyramid's mysterious function.Gameplay: 9/10There are four basic types of gameplay:  Environmental Navigation, Combat, some hoverboarding, and a bit of Stealth.I say Environmental Navigation instead of Platforming because you can't fall by accidentally jumping in the wrong direction.  Money jumps from acrobatic prop to acrobatic prop as he works his way through beautiful environments.  In the later levels, there is some timing involved, but the navigation elements are actually fun and you can explore the ruins for hidden items.The Combat is limited in terms of moves, but each move has a tactical function.  This isn't one of those games where you get 50 xxxyxyxxyyyyx, attacks and they all pretty much do the same thing.  You get a wide arcing XXX attack, a linear damaging YY attack, a block, a counterattack, an evade, an evade attack, a charge up stun attack that stuns enemies or temporarily removes shields, a 360 knockback, and a super attack that charges up by hitting enemies.You typically fight 1-4 enemy mechs at a time and their attacks and defenses perfectly match your attacks and defenses.  Enemies have states when they are blocking and they are vulnerable.  Their position around Monkey determines if it's best to use XXX to damage a few of them or YY to heavily damage one of them.Attacks can either be blocked or evaded, and a few more powerful enemies have a glowing red unblockable attack that Monkey must dodge.  Some enemies have glowing shields in front of them, so Monkey must either use a stun attack to remove the shield, or quickly evade behind the enemy and strike it from behind.Monkey's staff can also be used to shoot two types of ammo.  Blue, stuns and removes shields, and red damages enemies.This simple system forces the player to constantly make decisions about their attacks and defenses, which makes combat engaging.  There isn't one all powerful move, instead there is a `best' move for every 2 seconds of gameplay.There are a few levels where Monkey can use a hoverboard and explore or chase bosses.  The controls feel like a loose skateboarding game, which is fine most of the time.  There are 2 levels in the game where Monkey must chase after bosses over difficult terrain while gliding over speed boosts.  If he misses a few of them or misses a jump, he dies and must start over.  These two levels are frustrating, especially on HARD Mode, where you have to be perfect.There is a bit of stealth in the game, where Monkey has the option to either fight mechs head on, or navigate around them, by finding the right path through the environment.  There may be a partially hidden hand hold somewhere that leads to rooftops.  Most of the time, I just fought the enemies because it was fun.Graphics:  10/10The environmental graphics are great, but where the game really shines is in the facial animations.  The same facial capture technology that was used in Avatar was used in this game.  As a result, the acting is the best that I've seen in a video game.  The scenes are also mo-capped, so the character's body language isn't just a bunch of recycled animations.Sound:  8/10There's some good acting, some decent ambient music, and the explosions bring the action to life.Maturity:  TeenThere are a few appropriately placed swear words and some fantasy violence when the main characters get killed, other than that, it's really just a guy and a girl navigating through environments and smashing robots.Replay Value:  3/10Aside from harder difficulty levels, there really is no reason to replay the game.  It takes 8-10 hours to finish the game on Normal Mode, depending on how much you explore and search for items.Overall:  9.5/10Enslaved really captures the feeling of a romantic fantasy adventure with action, suspense, and comedy.  The gameplay is streamlined but engaging, the graphics and sound bring the world to life, and the acting is great.  For $10 you can't go wrong!Buy this game if you like good adventure stories.Buy this game if you like Prince of Persia or Ico.Buy this game if you like adventures with dynamic melee combat.Rent it if you just want to blow through the story in 8-10 hours.Avoid this game if...  You know, I can't think of a reason to avoid this game, especially at $10.  This is a first for me.If you enjoyed Enslaved, you'll like the Prince of Persia games, the Batman Arkham Asylum, Batman Arkham City, and probably Castlevania:  Lords of Shadow.""",5,A Truly Great Adventure,2012/5/26 0:00

A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B00319DX4W,"Richard Baker BinaryMessiah""""",1,1,"The Good: Great story and characters, looks good technically, some time that game can be very epicThe Bad: Combat is flawed, horrendous camera, finicky controls, poor pacing, some tacked on elements, bland art styleNinja Theory has had a hard time establishing itself as a talented developer. With the major hype of Heavenly Sword, and luke warm sales to the crappy Kinect Joy Ride, and the controversy of DMC it's struggling. Enslaved is probably NT's most successful game mainly commercially due to it's better marketing. The story is probably the game's strongest point, as well as character development and combat takes a back seat.You play as Monkey a guy who escapes a slave ship that's crash landing in post-apocalyptic New York. Along the way to escape he finds himself stuck, and enslaved, but a young woman named Trip who needs his muscle to get her back home further west. The relationship between Trip and Monkey is what makes you keep playing, and their constant fight for freedom is heart warming.The combat had a lot of potential, but after the first chapter you'll get tired of it. It's the same two combos over and over again with a crappy camera that can't stay put. Sure the angles are cinematic, but if you get backed into a corner it's nauseating. The camera can't stay put at all, and it leads to cheap deaths, and frustration when mech after mech is beating you down. You can charge an EMP burst to disable shields and make the mechs temporarily stunned, and this is essential to defeating them due to their constant blocking and shielding. You can command Trip to use a decoy so long range mechs shoot at that instead of you so you can climb around and get to them. Some mechs have weak points that allow faster kills, and you can use your staff as a projectile weapon equipped with plasma rounds and EMP rounds. This staff is also used for puzzles and exploring as well.So combat is pretty finicky, but exploring can be a blast thanks to huge sprawling vistas, and easy to see glowing handholds and what not. Occasionally the camera gets in the way here or controls can be a bit touchy, but it's not nearly as frustrating as the combat. You'll notice orange orbs floating around everywhere and these are used for upgrades, but you can only upgrade if Trip is in the vicinity. There are some points where you can use Monkey's Cloud hoverboard and there are a few exciting moments like chasing a giant mech, but this feels a bit tacked on.The game also has pacing issues since the first chapter is epic then the next six or seven are the same repetitive area-to-area beating mechs up, jumping around affair. It's a shame that Enslaved feels like it's only 80% complete because it needed a lot more polish. Even though the game looks good technically it's pretty bland with just lots of green everywhere. There's no unique art style or anything and this is a shame. The mechs all look the same and the enemy variety is less than half a dozen. Boss fights some times feel epic, but they repeat often, so Enslaved is iffy on every subject. I do recommend this as a great weekend rental or bargain purchase.",3,Extreme repetition brings this otherwise unique experience down,2012/3/28 0:00

As usual i tried it out on both to see which played and looked the best, of course 360 won the demo battle. So i waited a while and got the game used. I was highly impressed with some"" of the graphics and the gameplay was stellar. Parts of the game look beautiful, other parts look a little rushed in certain areas, i still don't think during cut scenes the characters look all the great. This is basically like a futuristic version of Drakes Fortune with a great story and sci fi action. In the aspect of climbing its almost exactly like the formentioned game and also in lots of the back drops. The controls and mechanics are fast and responsive and as i said the dialogue is good along with the story, which i usually don't care about anyways. The game is quite easy, almost to easy and its never hard to find out where to go and what your next objective is. I think during the whole game i died about 5 times, thats it. Also for a journey or Odyssey, its a bit short. I didn't time it, but it was a slow snowy day and i don't think it could have been more than maybe 6 hours or so.The game is unique though and i would like to see more games like this in the future, fighting your enemies is a blast, the take downs are a lot like Batman Arkam Asylum, and as i said the gameplay is strong and not to repetitive. So if your looking for a great quick adventure actually with very little replay value and great graphics this game is for you. I really enjoyed it, a lot more than the straight forward bi-linear Castlevania Lord Of Shadows which was less than impressive, other than graphics. With much more repetitious gameplay.

From the tone and pacing of the campaign, to the graphics and the engine and to smaller but very important changes such as the return of the weapon wheel, Resistance 3 improves on its predecessor in nearly every way. But there is some unfortunate omissions and if you're looking for a every question answered"" kind of finale, you're not going to get that here but with a promising multiplayer offering, and a great campaign, Resistance 3 might not end up getting everyone's money thanks to bigger games in a really crowded Fall season, but it sure feels like it deserves it.During an alternate 1950's, an alien/mutated human race known as the Chimera swept through all of Asia and either killed or converted everyone in their path eventually making their way to England. Fighting back and driving them off was a lone American soldier named Nathan Hale who was infected by the Chimeran strain (Resistance: Fall of Man). While defeated, the Chimera pursued and set their eyes on America leading once again for Hale to make a valiant effort to drive them back (Resistance 2). But it was all for naught as 4 years later, the Chimera have taken over the country and only pockets of civilization living underground exist, vastly outnumbered and lacking the resources to fight them off. Living underneath Haven, Oklahoma is Joseph Capelli, a former soldier and squadmate of Hale, who is newly married with a son. But when Dr. Malikov, the scientist from the second game finds him and explains a situation that threatens to completely wipe out humanity, Capelli and Malikov make the long trek to New York City to if nothing else, deal a huge blow to Chimeran forces and hopefully, wipe them out completely.What makes the Resistance 3 story way more effective than its 2 predecessors is that there's an emphasis not only in the situation humanity has found itself in but also the motivation of its protagonist. Things are grim and faced with the possibility of having his family and everyone else's wiped out, Capelli's journey is one of personal stake and not one of military orders like Hale's. The campaign is also incredibly well-paced and with each chapter (20 in all) promising the introduction of either a new weapon, setpiece or environment, the game does a good job at keeping things varied. The only slight misstep is the ending but I don't mean that in a abrupt scenes-are-missing feeling that Killzone 3's gave but rather it feels a bit too brief and for a series with a thick backstory and questions a mile long that need be asked, it's disappointing not everything is addressed.Learning from their mistakes, Insomniac also brought back some gameplay elements that were lacking in Resistance 2. Chief among them is the weapon wheel so while realistically, one man shouldn't be able to carry 2 assault rifles, one rocket launcher, a sniper rifle and others, gameplay wise it makes for more varied and dynamic firefights. No longer do you have to pick up the new weapon found to deal with the next situation, now you can just decide how to best approach it. With weapons having alternate fires such as the makeshift bomb that magnum rounds give, the shield the Auger puts up or a mini-turret the Marksman lays down, you can use one gun for most of it or change things up when you need to. And it's best if you mix things up since weapons will actually level up with use so bullseye can now tag up to 3 enemies instead of one or the shotgun can shoot a powerful concussive blast and even light them on fire which makes combat even more satisfying as it continues. Also returning are health packs and thankfully they're always around when you need them and not sneakily hidden or thin in numbers. While you can buy cheats to be used in campaign, among them is the shooter-standard regenerating health, the return of health packs is a welcome one.Graphically, this isn't the next Playstation 3 ""look what we can do"" powerhouse like God of War and Uncharted are but the game is remarkably improved over R2. More attention is paid to its atmosphere and lighting with wind kicking up tons of dust particles and debris, levels played out in the snow and some cool setpieces involving a foggy river trip and a stampede (it's best to see it for yourself), the extra year helped make not only a more pleasing looking campaign but a better designed one. Sound design is equally strong with guns such as the bullseye getting a more violent sound, the distinct Chimeran roars and death knells abound, and the setpieces and accompanying music are appropriately epic. Voice acting is also very solid and despite some rather stiff facial animation (though let's be honest: after LA Noire, everything looks bad in comparison), characters are believably voiced and though there's a lack of personalities among them, they're at least not laughable to hear.  One thing to note is the game does have a 3D mode option which I of course can't test because I'm not fortunate / rich enough to afford one but least it's there for people who do.Another overhaul is in its online modes so once there was a unique and addicting 8 player co-op mode, now it's just campaign co-op. Instead of a huge 60 player count in its multiplayer, now it's 8 on 8. While the missing co-op mode is cause for sadness, the actually multiplayer is a welcome change since the 60 matches were chaotic and almost cluster****-ish though the new offering is more ""Call of Duty with a Resistance skin"". Now I'm not completely adverse to anything with a CoD-like structure and what's on hand here is promising though not altogether spectacular. Getting XP to level up in rank so you can access abilities and get killstreaks (called ""berserks"") is fairly standard now but with the unique weaponry of the series, it's just different enough and plays well enough to be exciting. But there's some faults such as sometimes the game temporarily stops and freezes before it continues, weapons and abilities can be either underpowered and useless to overpowered and irritating. But then the matchmaking was remarkably quick and with promises of more updates in the future, the multiplayer should hopefully last quite awhile.Another thing to note: Resistance 3 is the first game to have an ""Online Pass"" system where new copies of the game will be shipped with a code that must be redeemed to access the online. The one caveat is that unlike some of EA's passes which at least contain a trial, if you rent or buy used, you're not allowed on there period so either you pay 10$ for a multiplayer you might not care for or it's all-in and you're paying full price for the game.While it's kicking off the busy-as-hell Fall season of games, I'm not entirely sure if Resistance 3 will be the big hit it should be. With bigger and even multi-platform titles on the horizon, people might just pass this game up to save for something else. Which is unfortunate because this is easily the best Resistance game with a campaign better than you'd think and a multiplayer that should have legs to it, it's a game that I found easy to enjoy despite its flaws.

Main aspects of the game such as visuals, level design, story, and weaspons have all been improved over R2 but only slightly in some areas. One thing I like the most is the weapons; they feel a lot more powerful than before and there are a few additions are gives you more variety. Enemy AI and variety has also been improved over past releases; no more hopping back and forth!

When I picked it up about 4 years later it looked like crap, was ridiculously hard, and had ho-hum multiplayer. I never finished it and skipped the second game. The third game has a new protagonist, Joe Capelli, and has a more organic fluid campaign reminiscent of Half-Life 2 than Resistance. You go from the east coast to New York to destroy the tower that the Chimera have built to freeze the Earth over. This is the last shot to save humanity, but in the mean time you get to meet some new and old (Chimera) faces.The game is still too familiar to me and will be for Resistance vets. No matter how many times you re-create Chimera they are still the same and it's pretty old by now. The same tactics work, most of the same guns are still here (Bullseye, Rossmore Shotgun, Auger, Deadeye etc.) plus a few new ones. The Cryo gun is fun, but most of the weapons are the same, and the same problems are still present in the game. There isn't enough ammo that you can hold for each gun so you have to constantly swap weapons even if the situation doesn't call for it. There is no regenerating shield (there's a reason why Bungie invented it for Halo) and health packs are scarce even on normal difficulty. The game is extremely tough because it feels built for co-op because dozens of Chimera will come after you and you will die with just a few hits. This means taking 20 steps forward only to find a horde and get pushed back 50 steps.Thankfully you can level-up your weapons just by using them and useful things happen like your shotgun spits out incendiary shells, your Deadeye will highlight heads, and your revolver will cause more damage.Despite the ridiculously difficult campaign there are some great cinematic moments but they are far and few between. The first third of the game is nicely paced with varied environments ranging from a forest, to a train ride, to the snowy streets of New York, but after you get near the tower it's the same Chimera bases and architecture that we've seen three times already (if you count the PSP's Resistance: Retribution which was equally as difficult). The game gets even more difficult, and the story becomes less interesting. The characters are pretty shallow and there's not too much delivery in story despite a few odd twists, plus a disappointing ending that makes you feel like the developers gave you the middle finger for sticking with the series for 6 years.There's multiplayer here if you really need to keep playing, but one play through was enough for me. Resistance 3 has some amazing visuals, despite some ugly textures here and there, and will satisfy fans with a difficult and challenging campaign. FPS players used to Call of Duty and Halo will probably hate this game (and the series), so only hardcore FPS fans should take the path of Resistance.",4,Extreme difficulty and tiresome familiarity may turn even fans away,2012/3/28 0:00

It starts off kind of slow, but really picks up as you progress further into the story. Some of the later battles are truly awesome. These late battles are really long and you will earn victory the hard way. A player's shooting skills are really put to the test. However, it is not hard, and a lot of fun!This is one immersive game. There are short cutscenes in every chapter. They draw you in. I found myself playing just to see what happens next in the story! It is a good story, with a few twists and turns compared to the average shooter. Very nice.The graphics are pretty good. At first, I thought they were only so-so, but they are, in fact, quite nice. Environments are well rendered, and the enemy Chimera have never looked this good. Cutscenes are seemlessly interwoven into the game, and the entire game uses the same graphics capability, whether it is a cutscene or normal play.Sound is pretty good. I turned sound effects to maximum to get the best sound out of weapons fire. Explosions and enemy deaths are well done. The background music is both ominous and foreboding, and plays differently during the battles; when you finish off the all enemies the music will change. The music is also just right for this apocalyptic setting. Again, very nice.Gun play is excellent, the best in the series. Each gun is useful, and there are some neat varieties, as well. Also, you have all the weapons you have picked up, so pick and choose whatever method of destruction you desire. All of the weapons are very nice indeed.I thought at first that I would not like the way healing is handled. Health kits are needed to heal. However, the play is just right. There are times, in some battles, where you run around frantically looking for a health pack. Not that it is crucial. Usually, there is a lull in the battle as you are running-n-gunning while you look for that ever-needed health restore. In the end, the way healing is handled is a plus for this game.This is an Epic game. Sony really put a lot of effort into this game. The credits are very long! I clocked in 9.5 hours playing this game, as some of the later battles require good tactics to wade through. Resistance 3 is one heck of a shooter!There are not many boss battles; those are found in Resistance 2. The few boss battles in the game are new and refreshing and tons of fun! I really liked what was included in Resistance 3 for the boss battles. They are neat and innovative, not frustrating at all. In the end, just shoot!Resistance 3 is a top-quality game. The levels are well designed, and the play is fantastic! This Exclusive science-fiction shooter is well worth playing.",5,Resistance 3 - Save Humanity From Extinction!,2012/8/28 0:00
A2U7DXDNYBBLQJ,B003O6E67A,"Shane Windham Shane Windham, author""""",0,0,"One thing worth pointing out right away is that R3 really does incorporate the best elements of the first two games. The bleak and near-hopeless feel of the first game is here, yet as colorful and packed with massive enemies as the second game. The weapons are really just more of the same. But, for those who've never played a Resistance game, please understand that these are not complaints. These are good things.Stage and sound design are ridiculously good in this entry. But the story didn't do much for me. And I've never actually been drawn enough to the Resistance multi-player to even try it out. So I can't offer an opinion as to the online component of this game.Falling somewhere between everything great about the Killzone and Dead Space games; Resistance 3 makes for a gripping and action packed campaign; highlighted by equal moments of furious fights to survive and creepy strolls through the mostly humanity-devoid stages. And the larger enemies make it memorable.Still, this isn't doing anything we haven't already seen. As long as you aren't expecting innovation, you will love this game. It won't win any awards for game of the year, and it doesn't hook you the way Resistance 1 probably managed to, but that doesn't make this experience worth skipping. Trust me, Resistance has plenty of excellence left to exhaust. This entry is no exception. Buy now.",4,Atmospheric and familiar to anyone who's played the first two,2012/4/9 0:00
A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B003O6E800,"Christopher Barrett Evil Corgi""""",0,0,"Answer: that depends. If you have a copy (whether a ROM, a download from Wii, or on an original N64), then probably not. If you don't currently have a copy, then you really should get this title. I'm not big on $39.99 MSRP re-releases (unless the developers completely revamp the game), but this is arguably the best game ever made (arguably! though my vote goes to FF7), and one should play this title at least once, preferable more than once. I have been playing through a copy checked out from my local library (gotta love Portland libraries!).Here is what you get: a 3-d enhanced version of the original. There are a few extras, namely the boss rush (kind of boring) and the Master mode, which is a mirror image of the original game with enemies doing 2x damage. Interesting, but not the kind of additions I would have hoped for. I would have liked perhaps an additional new dungeon or two, or maybe a new little branch of the world, perhaps a fishing side quest beyond the in game one. It IS widescreen though! Whereas the original N64 version was the square screen size.Regardless, the game is amazing, and better to have few minor extras than none at all! The 3-d really works for this title, though it's not as amazing compared to some of the games made specifically for 3ds such as Super Mario 3d land or Mario Kart 7. And with the slider, one can take the 3d off and play basically the same version as the N64, just in widescreen.The controls are different than N64, but of course they had to be thanks to the different control setup. I liked some of the changes. Having the touch screen for a few extra quick weapons was nice. The other weapons go on the X and Y keys. I kept mixing up A and B, I might go back and look at the N64 version, but I think these were backwards on the old system. L button is for targeting. In the options you can invert Y axis and set the L target to lock (recommend you do this!) instead of hold. The ability of the game to pan the camera when moving the 3ds is nice in theory, but works best when not in 3d mode. When you start moving the 3ds you lose your 3d sweet spot... But nice try.And for those who haven't played the game... It is classic Zelda in a way. It does have the 3-d environment (unlike the previous Zelda titles) and was the first true Zelda game in the 3-d style (don't talk to me about the CDi Zelda games!). But it is still hack and slash action adventure. No exp, no hp (only heart containers), and a steep difficulty ramp starting at about the Water Palace. Heck, the last boss is easy compared to the last few dungeons!If you go about finding all of the heart pieces and maxing out your inventory, this game could take 40 hours or so. I recommend not using a guide when doing this, as it's a lot of fun finding these on your own. And the world is smaller than in Twilight Princess, so it's not as exasperating trying to explore.Bottom line: buy it if you don't own it. Otherwise weight the pros and cons. Do you need to spend $40 for true 3-d as well as a Master mode? That depends on your super fan level. I won't be buying it myself thanks to ready availability at my local library. If they didn't have a copy, I would probably have broken down and bought another despite having the game already. It's fun to play it on the handheld in 3d and is a winning trip down memory lane!",5,"Arguably the best game ever, but do you need to buy it again?",2012/12/12 0:00

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B003O6E800,"Michael Kerner Michael Kerner""""",4,2,"There is no honest question about it, The Legend Of Zelda has been one of the most definitive video game franchises of all time. Nintendo has shown that they have no signs of slowing Link and company down whatsoever. This year is a massive one for Link, he is celebrating the 25th anniversary of his first quest against the hateful Ganon. Along the way, he has made so many encounters with a great cast of friends from Zelda, to Midna from Twilight Princess, and so many others all in his quest for the tri-force. With all the hype surrounding the upcoming Skyward Sword for the Nintendo Wii, Nintendo said they weren't going to do much to celebrate the silver celebration of Zelda. What they have donw is brought out the classics. Not just for the Wii, but a revamped Ocarina for the new Nintendo 3DS, and honestly it is worth the tri-force.The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time 3D brings back the excitement and thrills of what made the Nintendo 64 classic, into a new generation of fans. The gameplay is just as amazing, as Link does what he needs to to reconnect the pieces of time, and search for the idol medallions through amazing quests from Hyrule, all the way to the Forest Temple, to Hyrule Castle. The graphics do look absolutely amazing, and the music has all been restored brilliant in shine from top to bottom. The challenge that Nintendo had by bringing the N64 classic stands absolutely tall. The control though is a bit more complex if you've never played the Nintendo 64 version, or don't have the Wii to download it through the Wii's virtual console. The control really puts you to the test as you fire weapons like the light arrow and slingshot with the 3DS motion sensor. It can be rough to get used to at first (unless you've played The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess for the Wii,) but after a bit of practice you'll get the swing of things. The music though has been brilliantly redesigned to fulfill the 3DS platform, but the gameplay is absolutely challenging.All in all, there have been few games right now that have been worth buying for the Nintendo 3DS, and honestly The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time 3D is one that is absolutely worth the price to play. I never did play it when it was made for the Nintendo 64, but honestly I am glad that I got the chance to for the Nintendo 3DS. It absolutely is worth the effort, and follows through with why games love the Nintendo 3DS. What Super Mario 64 was to the Nintendo DS when it came out in 2004, The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D is that game to the 3DS. With other great Nintendo 64 games coming to the 3DS like Starfox 64 3D soon, it is going to be rough to equal the fun, but this is truly a must buy for the Nintendo 3DS, and Link and Zelda are so proud.Graphics: A-Sound: BControl: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B+Overall: B+",4,Zelda 3DS Style,2011/6/24 0:00
A21GTH20R33D6B,B003O6E800,Rondy,143,16,"I am going to be really strict for this review for 3 reasons:1. This is a remake- a second chance of the same game.2. I am an experienced gamer and have played the old version, amongst many other games, old gen and next gen.3. This is a Zelda game, and fans expect the best.Why one star? I know many people love Zelda, and no doubt some people will write angry comments thereafter, but try to understand, expectations MUST BE HIGH due to the 3 reasons above.I am very disappointed with this game.First, Ocarina of Time was a home console game, and should stay that way. There is no reason to make it for the 3DS, except to fit it in a small screen so that you can sell a low definition graphics game in today's world of Next-Gen consoles. If PS2 games can be made HD and ported to the PS3, why not this game? Of course, it is very obvious that til this date, Nintendo still has not released a decent HD home console. (The Wii U is sub par in my view.)That being said, the feel of Ocarina of Time is very different on a handheld. You struggle with a small screen, and the controls are awkward. It does not feel as pleasurable as on an N64.3D is a nice gimmick, but the feeling of novelty wears out pretty quickly. And yes, the graphics are updated and look better, partly because of the illusion that a smaller screen makes it look more detailed. Experienced gamers are able to tell right away.Touch screen functionality is absolutely unecessary. Why do you need it when you didn't have a touch screen for the N64? Seems like every port to the 3DS requires touch screen use. It did more harm than good here; it is just distracting, and makes you switch from the button controls and pick up the stylus regularly, and is such a pain.Again, I emphasize, this is a review of Zelda: Ocarinao of Time on the 3DS. Not the N64 version. The game is great and nothing has changed, but this release is illogical.",1,A disappointment.....,2013/7/21 0:00
A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B003O6E800,S. Rhodes,7,4,"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is by far one of the most critically acclaimed games of all time.  When it was released back in 1998 it garnered so many perfect scores that some have gone on to claim it as THE best game ever made.  It's gameplay in particular helped establish the action RPG genre.  To this day several video games still draw quite heavily (and fondly) from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.  As a result, Nintendo has decided to play it safe with this reissue.  You won't find a lot of new things here.  It's the same game you've always remembered.If you've experienced the game before you're going to know it like the back of your hand.  That's not to say there aren't a few gameplay differences, but they're mechanical mostly.  You won't find yourself going to any new dungeons or fighting new enemies.  But you will find that some of the control scheme is a little different.  For instance, inventory management is noticeably simpler here.  The action all plays out on the top screen while your inventory is on the bottom.  At the simple touch of the screen you can equip new items, view your gear and take a peak at the map.  It clears up the top screen so that you can view the gameplay and cinemas a lot better without there being a lot of clutter.There are, of course, no C-Buttons to set your items to.  Instead you can set two items.  One to X and one to Y.  It's not the same three, but you CAN set two additional weapons to slots on the touch screen that can be used fairly easily at the touch of a button.  It's a small change, but still effective.  The games controls transition to the 3DS smoothly and they're pretty tight and responsive.  The biggest difference to the controls is how it works in the 3DS's motion controls.  You can actually use the 3DS as a scope while you're targeting with your slingshot or arrows.  It's actually quite precise and easy.  If you don't want to use the motion controls you don't have to, and that's not really such a bad thing at all.The biggest upgrade, of course, are the graphics.  The original game used a lot of polygons to render Link and the denizens of Hyrule.  When playing Ocarina of Time 3D things have been smoothed over, but not unusually changed.  Characters such as Link, Zelda, Saria, etc. look pretty much exactly the same, but with less of the blocky and jagged edges and rather with smooth, round faces.  You're going to find a lot of 3DS games that look better, obviously, but the graphical upgrade isn't so bad in and of itself.  It's definitely easier on the eyes.  But that graphical improvement is pretty much all you get.  You won't actually get a lot more detail... just a lot of smoothing over.  It's more of an enhanced port rather than something that's been built from the ground up.  It represents Ocarina of Time's art style perfectly, but at the core it's still the same old N64 game.  You won't find areas strangely populated with more people, for instance.  And while a lot of the game looks better, there are still a few places that look as though they've been untouched.  So you won't really find a lot of additions.  Just a nice enhancement.The sound, however, doesn't sound any different at all.  Most of the classics tunes are in tact.  The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time has a marvelous soundtrack, but sometimes it's hard not to wish that perhaps there could've been an enhanced soundtrack as well.  Either way, it still sounds good.  The sound effects are also the same.  Link screams and grunts are the same, as is his sword and Navi's annoying presence.  Here, it seems like nothing has changed.In terms of new content, Ocarina of Time 3D is devoid of quite a bit.  You won't find any new dungeons or enemies or characters who have expanded tales or anything like that.  It's all the exact same game.  If you mastered the original N64 version there is nothing here that's going to be any different.  This might bum a few gamers out.  Especially because The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time has had a couple of releases already.  Two of them were on the Gamecube and there's one on the virtual console.  Veterans of the game are going to have to decide if a graphical enhancement alone is worth the price.That's not to say there aren't a few things added.  Just none of them really pertain to changing up the gameplay experience.  There is a Master Quest to tackle where the dungeons are slightly different and the world is mirrored.  You have to complete the game once to unlock the master quest.  There's also a boss challenge mode to tackle as well.  That's really about all you get with this package.  So once again it boils down to whether or not the enhanced graphics alone are worth the price.One thing to note, however, is that Ocarina of Time seems to have aged rather well.  The gameplay is still fun and immersive.  There are tons of places to explore and tons of sidequests.  Even by todays standards, Ocarina of Time is still well packed full of things to do.  If you've never experienced The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time before, this is a great place to do so.  If you have experienced the game before, it may be hard to command you play it again because of graphical enhancements and 3D... but it has still managed to age well, and it is still a lot of fun to play.",5,It Stands the Test of Time,2011/6/23 0:00
ADLVFFE4VBT8,B003O6EATE,"A. Dent Aragorn""""",480,429,"A few hours since delivery... I'm impressed. Just about everything about the PSV: display, controls, features, the games - top of the line. This is a gaming machine that shouts quality"" and, after the first few hours of playing Uncharted and a couple of small games off the PSN, I can say that I've had the best portable gaming experience ever - we currently have a PSP and a DSi in the house plus a couple of tablets and smart phones.Briefly - and I will update my review as I experience more of the PSV - these are my findings so far.HARDWARE AND FEATURESI'm not going to get into details because Amazon's page has it all. Yes, it's quad-core this, and super-high-rez display that but what counts is that it translates into a super-smooth gaming experience with a bunch of non-gaming capabilities on top. I'm surprised how immersive playing a game on such a small screen with such tiny speakers can be. And it is so for a couple of reasons.- the sharpest, best looking display I've seen on a portable- the dual analog sticks make all the difference - Sony learned from past mistakes- the back touch panel are something that it's better to experience because it's the one clear innovation on this machine and it won't give you headaches (sorry Nintendo :) )- games can be either downloaded or purchased and shared on physical media - like I said, Sony is learning from past mistakes (sorry PSP Go)- seamless integration with the PS3 and the Playstation Network- a bunch of great multimedia apps including Netflix - I'll have more to say about these after I stop playing Uncharted :)- cameras - more later but I heard that some games allow you to build characters that look just like youTHE GAMING EXPERIENCEAnyone who has a PS3 or a PSP should feel very familiar with the PSV. All the PS3 controls are there although some of the buttons are smaller. Add to that the 'touch' capabilities on both front and back with support for gestures and the gaming possibilities are almost endless. Because of its high resolution, there can be a lot happening at the same time on the PSV's screen and, don't forget, you can also feel the action while playing.I don't feel like doing comparisons at this time but anyone who claims that the PSV is no big deal because we can play games on our phones should experience the PSV and then consider revising their statements. Vita can easily play any one-dollar game that a phone can play and I'm sure we'll get a couple of those and Vita can do just about everything a smart phone or tablet can do and most of the time do it better, but no phone or tablet can play Uncharted and no 'next generation' phone or tablet is likely to be able to play Uncharted or Little Big Planet. And, let's not forget that the Vita costs a less than most smart phones.EVERYTHING ELSEI haven't had time to explore all of Vita's features yet but, they're all in there. Multimedia, wireless connectivity, music playback... it's all in there. Add to that one of the best laid out, intuitive and responsive user interfaces and even non gamers should be happy to have a Vita around.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKEA couple of things. The most annoying is, of course, the hyper-overpriced memory card. You can't play 'big games' without one and Sony decided to make lots of money on this proprietary 'must have' add-on which is anything but optional. Then there's of course Sony not making the Passport program available in the US. We have a PSP and lots of games on UMDs. Not being able to play them on the Vita is very frustrating.Other than that... perhaps I should have titled my review 'gamer changer' because the Vita is likely to change me into a more active portable player. I used to prefer the PS3 over the PSP but I'm not sure this will always be the case in the future. I know that I won't put the Vita down until I'm done with Uncharted and once I complete that there are at least half a dozen games available on lunch date that I'd like to play.Oh and... I don't really like sharing our Vita with the kids at this time but I have to :)____________________________________________NOTES OF CAUTIONBefore deciding whether you want to buy a Vita and as you are budgeting for one, keep the following in mind:* SINGLE-USER SYSTEM - or so it is meant to be at this time. Like the PSP, the Vita will recognize only ONE account. Unlike the PS3, you can't have other members of your family or friends log with a sub-account. If you are planning to share the PSV, Sony suggests that individual users keep their game saves on separate memory cards but you will still be logged on the Vita as the one user who 'owns' it.* TROPHIES - A Sony representative confirmed to me that only the 'owner' will get credit for the trophies, no matter who may be earning them during gameplay because the PSV only recognized one user.* DOWNLOADS - If you buy a 'download' you will have to download that game on each of your family members memory cards who wish to play that game individually.* MEMORY CARDS SIZE - see above for the multiple users scenario. In addition, get the biggest memory card you can possibly afford. The size of downloaded games tends to be enormous. Uncharted alone is 3.2 GB which is just about all that a 4 GB card can hold. Most games I care about seem to be 2 GB or larger.* DON'T PLAN ON BUYING MANY DOWNLOADABLE GAMES - see above. Half a dozen downloaded games would fill up your 16 GB memory card with little room for anything else. I would buy games on physical media whenever possible.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;""",5,Game Changer?,2012/2/22 0:00

A114TMHW9GRMPB,B003O6EATE,PM_SuperFreak,4,3,"As a gadget nut and a previous owner of the original PSP, I was watching the PSV from the start. It was appealing and showed promise, but I didn't really jump on the bandwagon"" right away. I was confident that Sony would deliver a high-quality product but was unsure about types of games that would be made available. Then I saw some videos of Hot Shots Golf and I knew I had to have this system. I went for it, and do not regret my decision one bit. The 5-inch screen really pushed the boundaries of what is considered a ""portable"" system, but it's as good as it gets. The resolution and clarity is incredible, and the performance is very smooth.Here is a run-down of my thoughts. I have the DS and DSi XL but I won't bother comparing PSV to these systems because it's like comparing apples to oranges. Instead, I will make a few references to the PSP since I feel that is the predecessor.Pros- Overall feel of the system is very solid. It's not as heavy as my original PSP Phat yet it does not feel flimsy like the newer editions of the PSP. The construction is mostly metal with some plastic components. The concave design on the back is a good choice as it allows you to hold the system more securely (as compared to the PSP).- Very nice screen. Bright and crisp.- Great controls. D-pad has been improved significantly. Control sticks are small nubs which feel smaller than they look, but they are still far superior to the tab on the PSP.- The back touch pad is has a nice feel to it. From the pictures, it seems to be very sippery but when I felt it for the first time, the feel surprised me as it has a slightly tacky feel which is not completely smooth. This actually works really well since it improves the grip on the device. I don't know how many games will utilize this unique control mechanic but Hot Shots Golf uses it well by allowing you to determine the distance to the pin by touching a point on the course.- Sony included a USB cable/AC adapter which is great. It enhances the versatility if you want to transfer files from/to a PC or PS3.Cons / Minor Gripes- Integrated battery may become an issue; as the years go by we can't replace the battery ourselves if it fails to charge. This seems to be the trend these days as seen in tablet PCs. It's a minor concern rather than an issue I think.Miscellaneous Observations- The system boots up fairly quickly. It seems to be slightly quicker than PSP.- When you insert a game cartridge, the system will go through a quick install and put some files on your memory card. This process is also quick; probably around 30 seconds or so.- The 'Start' and 'Select' buttons seem to be too depressed which makes it difficult to press. I can see that this is by design so that you don't accidentally push them.- Many people are not happy about the memory cards being so over-priced. I tend to agree that Sony found a way to gouge loyal consumers again, but this is what Sony has done for years with their proprietary formats. If you look at the positive side, you get to decide how much storage you need/want. If the unit came with a standard internal storage then we would not have that choice and could have been stuck paying an even higher price.Closing CommentsThe PSV is a great piece of technology that has great potential. I have only used mine for a few days but I am thoroughly impressed by the quality of the product so far. The longevity of this product will depend on Sony's ability to release top-notch, high-value games either via full releases or PSN. With so many different control schemes, I anticipate developers will come out with many more titles in the coming months/years. If you consider yourself a gamer at all, and crave for more serious, deeper games instead of what you get on your cell phone or tablet, you should seriously consider the PSV!""",5,Amazing piece of tech!!,2012/3/21 0:00
A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B003O6EATE,"Richard Baker BinaryMessiah""""",7,6,"The Good: Two analog sticks!, huge gorgeous OLED screen, responsive touch screen and rear pad, two cameras work great, gyroscope adds another dimension to gaming, game cards are a Godsend, extremely powerful, interesting new interfaceThe Bad: Memory cards are outrageously expensive, 3G is a rip-off from AT&T;, battery doesn't last too long, start and select buttons are poorly placed, lacking a lot in software and featuresIt's hard to believe that it has been 8 long years since the PSP came out, but its true. Those long years gave us some of the best portable games ever made and the first true attempt at a portable console experience. Unfortunately the system was doomed from the start with proprietary disc media, no second analog nub, and a slew of other things, but the system was a powerhouse at the time and had a lot of potential. The Vita is Sony's second calling and it fixed all the issues of the PSP plus some, and one of those is noticeable as soon as you pull the shiny new device out of the box.A second analog stick. An honest-to-God stick and not a nub or pad. These things feel like they moved straight from the DualShock controller and just shrunk a little. They feel great, even in-game, and I couldn't believe that the second stick was there it was like a wish came true from God himself! This opens up the Vita to a whole slew of games that couldn't be done on the PSP just because of this one little piece of hardware. While playing Uncharted: Golden Abyss I actually forgot the second stick was there a few times because I'm so used to the single nub on the PSP. It may take some PSP vets some getting used to before truly adapting to it. The next big thing that Sony fixed was no disc media! Thank you very much! Those UMDs were irritating and sucked up precious battery life as well as limiting the memory size. Now we get nice little carts, like the DS, or you can download the game digitally via the PlayStation Store.Sony made one fatal flaw with the Vita and that is the proprietary memory cards. What in God's name was Sony thinking?  Everyone thought the memory stick pro-duos for bad for the PSP, but at least those were regular memory sticks. These tiny little things only work in the Vita and cost a fortune. A 32GB will run you $100 which is a complete rip-off, but guess what? You don't have a choice! Thanks a lot jerks!The next big thing Sony did was add a touch screen. Copied the DS you say? Not exactly, its more like it copied smartphones, but flip this guy over and you have a touchpad on the back which is Sony's little way of saying, Hey we're trying to be original too"". It's an odd thing to have and not many games use it yet, but it adds a whole new dimension to touchscreen gaming, and it's just as responsive as the touchscreen so it doesn't feel like a dead limb. However, it's up to game developers to use this odd mechanic but only time will tell.The screen is one of the best things of the device because its OLED (Organic Light Emitting Display) so you're looking at some of the best display technology out. Now you don't have to worry about dead pixels! Yeah...remember that launch fiasco Sony? The screen is 5' which is the biggest portable gaming screen ever made and even tops the PSP's 4.3' screen. This allows for lots of detail in your face and tons of room for touching things on the screen.Once you get over how gorgeous the screen (I can't stop staring at it!) you will start hitting those buttons on the device. Sure they don't do anything unless your in-game (the Live Area is all touchscreen based, but more on that later) but the button layout here could have been a disaster. Sony had to be really careful because of those new sticks so the D-pad and face buttons shrunk about half their size and got moved up. Blasphemy! Actually no. Despite the higher placement and smaller size I still hit them accurately like the PSP even with my really big thumbs. The D-pad is way better than the PSPs and works well with fighting games (yes relax!) so no worries there. But...there is one problem with these buttons. The start and select buttons are way too small and are level with the system instead of sticking out. What! Did Sony fall asleep at the drawing board here? They are also placed all the way at the bottom of the right side so you have to move your hand down. C'mon...what happened there? Other than that the L and R buttons are nice and huge and you get a nice big PlayStation Home button the size of Venus on the left side, but hey it glows!Anyways, the buttons are just fine so how about everything else visually? Sony made the little ""compartments"" more subtle this time around so the memory slit is hidden at the bottom as well as the game card slot on top so the whole system just looks like a big oval. Don't be worried about the size of the thing either. Sure it's big and not exactly pocket-sized, but for what is under the hood this thing is compact and pretty light.Now that the visual stuff is out of the way lets talk about under the hood. This thing is the most powerful handheld on the market only being rivaled by devices powered by the Tegra 3 processor. The thing has a quad-core Arm-9 Cortex CPU which is freaking powerful. This allows for PS3 quality visuals that no other portable device on the market has. It also has a quad-core GPU which is over 4 times as powerful as the iPhone 4S's GPU. The system also packs 512 MB of system memory and 128 MB of VRAM (Video memory) which is astounding (the Xbox 360 has 512 MB of memory for comparison). We also get two cameras that are front and back facing which can track head movement, six-axis gyroscope, bluetooth, a microphone, and 3G wireless card. Holy crap that's a lot of stuff. This is one powerful device, but have yet to see what it is fully capable of.Now let's get down to software and how the thing plays. Every PlayStation fan by now is used to the XMB (Cross Media Bar) thanks to the PSP and PS3. Get ready for change because the new Live Area is made of bubbles. You like bubbles right? This is to make use of the touchscreen and takes awhile to get used to. You can rearrange these bubbles to your liking kind of like on a smartphone and even change the background for each ""page"". The Vita can multitask which is something the PS3 can't even do. You can play a game, hit the home button, go online and look up a FAQ, then flip back to your game without having to quit. Why can't you do that on the PS3? Someone at Sony was dropped on their head as a baby one to many times, but its nice to have it here.Once you start playing with the Welcome Park which gets you used to the Vita's new features, play around with Near which is like the 3DS's streetpass, but worse and more confusing, you will really start liking this guy. The browser works like the PS3, but has fewer features for some reason, but we get trophies! Oh my God trophies! These are also great for games that are cross platform so you can start working on a trophy on Marvel vs Capcom 3 then pick it right up on the Vita and finish unlocking that trophy.The Vita uses remote play  a lot better than the PSP mainly because its more powerful and can do what the PS3 can do. Right now the remote play is still pretty weak, but the potential is there. Right now only 3 games support cross play (MvC3, MLB 2K12, and Hustle Kings) but I'm excited for what this can bring. Overall the Vita has a lot of software potential, but is lacking a lot and feels kind of thin. Sony's attempt at augmented reality comes to life with the Vita with AR cards (yes they ripped off the 3DS) and it works really well thanks to the systems more powerful hardware and gyroscope.Overall, is the system worth $250? Yes it is if you are a hardcore portable fan or console fan. This is the first real console experience in portable form and Sony nailed it perfectly. The other big issue I forgot to mention is battery life. You get about 3-4 hours on a powerful game, 9 hours for music, 4-5 for video, so don't expect huge play sessions like on the DS. The battery lasts forever in sleep mode though! Sure, what good does that do you? For what this system does the battery life is actually pretty long because you're running a mini supercomputer off of it. Cut it some slack! The games for the system right now are OK, but not as awesome as the PSP launch (considered the best launch ever), but the games are reviewed separately. I would pick one up if you love portable consoles because this thing has so much potential. It just has a few major flaws and is quite lacking software wise, but Sony will probably pick up the pace over the next year.Over the next 5 years I see the Vita as the model for portable games. We'll start seeing games push the system graphically like God of War did for the PSP. I think we'll see games that give us more than just touchscreen smartphone games thanks to the rear touchpad. In 5 years I expect the library to grow beyond ports and we'll probably see the Vita's first killer app by the end of this year that redefines portable gaming kind of like Syphon Filter and God of War did for the PSP. Those games showed that even with major flaws the system can be something incredible and helped people look past them all. Something like that will pop up for the Vita in the next year or two and then we can start talking about moving forward in the portable market.""",5,Worth a buy for any PlayStation or handheld fan,2012/3/28 0:00
A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B003O6EATE,S. Rhodes,3,3,"Let's rewind the clocks back for a moment.  In 2005, Sony released the PSP.  At the time it was the most powerful handheld on the market.  It did some incredible things.  The specs were on part with the PS2, it could play music and movies... and yet for quite some time we could only talk about the &#34;potential&#34; it had for video games.  As time waned on many of the PSPs best games were either ports from the PS2 or games that were ported to the PS2 (Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories).  As a device it was fantastic.  But as a gaming system it took a lot longer than it should have to take off.  Eventually we did get some good, worthwhile software.  Despite selling moderately well and being a great piece of hardware, Sony just didn't seem all that crazy about pushing the gameplay experiences you could have with the device.And now history is repeating itself.The Playstation Vita is by far one of the greatest handheld gaming devices that you can find.  The hardware in and of itself is pretty impressive.  The graphical presentation of games is fantastic, but more than that... the user interface is pretty amazing as well.  It's almost like carrying around a Playstation 3 from time to time.  The user interface ditches the XMB used by the PSP and PS3 in favor of icons similar to apps on a smartphone menu.  Tap one and you can launch apps, games or your internet browser.  You can also sign in to the PSN and look at your trophies (on either PS3 or Vita).  You can also use your Vita for remote play on your PS3 or PS4.  It's a fascinating device.There are four face buttons (the classic square, triangle, circle and cross buttons) and a D-Pad.  But the nice little addition here is the inclusion of two analog sticks for your gaming pleasure.  Considering the kind of games the Vita can handle, having two will make a great deal of gaming experiences pretty simple (especially with rotating cameras).  There is an L and R buttons as well.  The other thing that makes the hardware pretty nice is the use of touch screens.  On the front the screen is also a touch screen.  So you can always tap on icons to utilize them as well.  Just the same, this function is also used in some games, though it isn't always to the benefit of the game you're playing.  Going beyond that there is also a touch panel on the back.  Again, this can also be used in gameplay, and again, not always to the benefit of the game.  But it's still a good idea if a developer ever makes good use of it.The Vita makes for a pretty decent portable entertainment center all on its own.  There are a multitude of apps you can download for the device.  If you're interested in Netflix or Hulu, this will work out just fine for you as well.  The screen makes it so that everything is pretty crisp and clean.  The picture you get is very clear.  The speakers also work well.  There are a multitude of apps to download for the time being and so it's pretty clear that you can use the Vita for much more than just gaming needs.  You can also now play PSOne classics on it where the back panel acts as the L2 and R2 buttons.  The most perplexing drawback to the Vita is that there's not backwards compatibility for PSP games.  So if you've still got PSP games you enjoy you might want to consider holding onto your PSP before getting rid of it for a Vita.  You can download PSP games but there is hardly any point to paying money for the same game twice if your physical copy is still in fine working order.  At least downloading PSP games isn't terribly expensive in the event you find yourself in need to do so.On the other hand this brings about the Vita's most aggravating flaw.  The fact that the memory cards are quite expensive and if you go the route of downloading games (or utilizing it for everything you can) you'll find it can eat up memory fast.  Even after the price drop, memory cards for the Vita can still be expensive.  Especially if you're looking for a lot of space.  Lastly, the battery life may not be totally sufficient.  Because of everything the Vita is it can eat away at the battery pretty fast.  Expect to have to charge it often.All that aside the device itself is a great piece of hardware.  The only other problem is that it doesn't quite have the software to support the hardware in question.  Going back to the PSP for a minute, we spent quite a bit of time wondering where are the games.  The Vita is in a similar boat.  It's had enough time to find its footing, but it seems that there are still not a lot of good games for the Vita just yet.  It's great to have the bells and whistles, but at the end of the day I already have devices that can do the things the Vita can already do.  If you've got a smartphone or a tablet you'll find that there isn't much point to getting a Vita if you're looking for good gaming experiences.  You might find use if you travel a lot, but that's about it.  A lot of good Vita games are already on the PS3 or 360.  Want to play games like Mortal Kombat, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Rayman Legends or the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection?  Already readily available on the consoles.  The Vita doesn't have too many games it can call its own.  It's a fantastic piece of hardware... but I'm still waiting for a gaming experience to come out that can make the Vita more worthwhile.  I don't mind an entertainment center in my pocket (although you'll probably be investing in cases, screen protectors etc.) but I didn't buy a Vita JUST to have an entertainment center in my pocket.  I'd really like some great games to play and this is the area where the Vita seems to be lacking most severely.  It's hard to convince a gamer to buy a particular device (even a handheld one) if you can't provide the software for it.  They're often the bread and butter of what makes a gaming console or handheld so worthewhile to begin with.  All the other things my Vita does I have devices for and more.  But what those things wouldn't be able to do that my Vita can is provide a gaming experience I won't find on a tablet or a smartphone.  And with the hardware capabilities it also means that I could have an experience that a console might not be able to provide.All that being said, the Vita IS a great piece of hardware.  It is amazing just how much power will literally be in the palm of your hand.  If it had great software to accompany the great hardware it would be a fantastic device to have.  As it stands now, it's hard to recommend the portable device for those who are really looking for unique gaming experiences.",4,Great Hardware That Would Be Better With Great Software,2014/2/3 0:00

A2IGEPJJYKMOWK,B003O6EATE,UziHorowitz,3,2,"Before I start this review, let me first state that I am also a fan of the 3DS, as it's also a fantastic device.Now, onto the Vita, I think Sony has a hit on their hands here. It's quite clear that the Vita is not exactly an inexpensive purchase after you figure in the cost of the system, memory card, games and accessories, but I honestly think it's well worth it if you have the money to spend. The Vita is a classy handheld device, thanks to a beautiful high quality OLED screen, impressive technical specs that allow stunning graphics to be displayed, and it just feels like a pretty well put together product. The OS is generally very responsive and quick, which is because of the intuitive touch controls that allow everything to be very snappy. From the hardware to the software, the Vita is a slick package.Onto the game library thus far, I must admit I'm impressed.Uncharted: Golden Abyss - Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Crisp and detailed visuals, fun and interesting story, and much, much more. This is the game to own right now.Wipeout 2048 - Like Uncharted, this is another beautiful game. It doesn't run at 60 frames-per-second, only 30 frames-per-second, and the loading times, even post-patch, can be a tad bit lengthy, but it's worth it because this is a very slick and fun racing game.Rayman Origins - A stellar platforming game regardless of which platform you buy it for. The Vita version is especially gorgeous on the OLED screen.Lumines: Electronic Symphony - It's more Lumines, which is a good thing. Excellent music and visuals make this one puzzle game that you shouldn't miss out on.Shinobido II: Revenge of Zen - Excellent stealth adventure game for Tenchu fans. It has some quirks, like a dodgy camera and silly artificial intelligence, but it's a great game regardless.Touch My Katamari - Definitely the craziest Katamari game to date. The cutscenes provide some good entertainment. The controls work very well. Though it's not a very lengthy game.Those are the games I own so far and I'm very impressed with the lineup to date. In addition, more Vita games are in the pipeline for the coming months, which include Unit 13, Resistance: Burning Skies, Gravity Rush, Disgaea 3: Absence of Detention, Mortal Kombat, Ridge Racer, Warrior's Lair, just to name a few.As you can see, the Vita definitely has what it takes to be an excellent handheld device for many years to come. I hope people buy the Vita and make it a success. We determine the future of this device.",5,Playstation Vita - Handheld Gaming Bliss,2012/2/27 0:00
A2582KMXLK2P06,B0049DYNNO,B. E Jackson,5,3,"When I first opened up Super Mario All-Stars on Christmas morning, my eyes got really wide as I eagerly anticipated what Mario game I received the moment I ripped enough wrapping paper away to see the word Mario"".Was it Super Mario Galaxy 2? I had the first one and wouldn't mind playing the sequel.Was it the New Super Mario Bros. game? Hey I grew up with the classics so I wouldn't mind playing that updated version to see what all the fuss has been about concerning its new graphics and gameplay.Maybe a Mario Party game? I'm one of the few who never played one.No... it was NONE of those classic games- it was something I was not familiar with previously- a Wii version of Super Mario All-Stars.Quickly my excitement died down tremendously. Yes, I absolutely LOVE all four of the classic old-school games featured here, but the thing is... I already HAVE this game for my Super NES.Also, just a few months ago I happened to pull out the cartridge and play through all four games while going through a summer Super NES phase.So what's the point owning THIS Wii version? There's honestly not one. The game does absolutely *nothing* different in comparison to the Super NES version, and in fact, it took me a few minutes to even figure out how to start up the game. Yes I was quite aware you had to turn the Wii controller to its side in order to play 2D gaming, but still- simply starting up the game might take you a few minutes to figure out if this happens to be your first exposure to 2D gaming on the Wii.Even more problems- the ""1"" and ""2"" buttons are extremely small compared to the NES and Super NES buttons.  That's going to be a problem for many people who are used to the older controllers, I guarantee it.Nintendo did absolutely NOTHING to encourage anyone to buy this game (except for those who don't have the ability to download games and those who no longer -or never had- a Super NES to begin with). This is, without a shadow of a doubt, an extremely big ripoff. No, including a soundtrack isn't enough to make everything all better either. The soundtrack is average at best.  It's not like you need a soundtrack for a Mario game because you've heard the same themes plenty of times to the point of agitation anyway.While looking through the instruction booklet, I see pictures of Super Mario World.  Why in the WORLD is it not playable then?  Ripoff.I was even hoping there'd be an option to switch back to the old graphics and sounds of the original NES versions.  Nope.  Disappointing.The ONLY way to make such a collection of old Mario classics better would have been to include Super Mario World, Yoshi's Island, possibly a few Game Boy games, and heck, you know what?Don't call it ""25th Anniversary"". INSTEAD what Nintendo should have done was provide 25 years worth of the best Mario games such as Super Mario 64, Super Mario Galaxy, and a few others in *addition* to the classic NES and Super NES Mario games. THAT would have been the logical thing to do. After all, Metroid Prime Trilogy was a perfect collection of three huge games- Nintendo should have continued with the theme of ""classic game bundles"" by throwing in four or five popular Mario games released over the period of the last 25 years and put them onto a single disc.As it stands, it's very disappointing. No, I haven't experienced any unnecessary slowdown or lag time or anything like that- just the SAME EXACT GAME I played over 15 years ago. The games are incredible- this deal is not. 'Nuff said.""",2,it's nothing new,2010/12/27 0:00
A36UKFV79879MD,B0049DYNNO,BX Lounger,12,10,"In 1993, Nintendo decided to re-release the original NES Super Mario Bros games PLUS the version of Super Mario Bros 2 that was only released in Japan all on one SNES cartridge and call it Super Mario All Stars. Then they took it up several notches by updating the graphics and sounds of each individual game as if they were played as 16-bit SNES titles. It sold like hotcakes and eventually when they made more of the cartridges to keep up with the demand, they added an additional title, Super Mario World. I was fortunate to get it at the time and it was great to play through them all in updated graphics and all.Now, flash forward to the year 2010 and Nintendo announces they are releasing this on the Wii as a limited edition title. Renamed Super Mario All Stars Wii, this is the same exact version of the SNES title. That's right; you get four games (for reasons unknown, Super Mario World was omitted) as they were back in 1993. You also get an audio CD of the classic music tracks heard from various Mario games and an art book that discusses the history of Mario games. Having said all that, this begs me to ask:1) Why didn't Nintendo update the graphics and sound effects of all these games as if they were titles similar looking to the excellent New Super Mario Bros DS/Wii games?2) Why weren't there any extras included in the game disc? Why didn't they include additional classic Mario titles? There is still plenty of room left even after putting 4 games onto the same DVD. They could have added video interviews, retro commercials, etc.3) Why say that there are 20 tracks on the CD when 10 of them are just sound effects from the various Mario games?Many people would prefer to just have the music on the CD.4) The art book that comes with it is decent and all but doesn't really feature a lot of commentary from the creators of the games. All you get is a couple of lines and that's about it and it does not include all of the games Mario starred in.Overall, Super Mario Bros All Stars Wii Limited Edition is not a very, solid approach to honoring Mario and since they are celebrating his 25th anniversary, you would think that they would go all out. Realistically, this release is for those who no longer own any of the original versions of the titles included, own a working NES and SNES and did not download the original versions via the Virtual Console service. For $30, this would be an excellent value for those people. If you're a collector, then it is worth purchasing to own for years to come.I'm skipping on this for now because I own the SNES cart and have a working SNES so I can play this anytime I want. Maybe for the 30th, 40th or 50th anniversary Nintendo will wise up and put more effort into the tribute towards an international gaming icon.",3,Perfect for those who do not have the original SNES cartridge this is based on,2010/12/21 0:00

In essence you're getting Super Mario Brothers 1, 2, 3, and lost levels. These fun side scrollers were beloved by many when they first came out on the NES and SNES systems. You also get soundtrack music plus a booklet detailing some of the history of the games.The first thing to understand here is that these are OLD games with OLD graphics. They have jagged edges. They have simple gameplay. You're learning about classic gameplay here, or reliving your childhood, depending perhaps on how old you are. They aren't going to have cutting edge soundtracks or advanced monsters. You're lucky if you can tell if your little enemy has eyes or not.The second issue is that these games already exist in the Wii online game catalog. That is, even before this special Wii disc set came out you could own all four games simply by going into the online Wii store and buying it there. It would be cheaper to do that too. However, if you do that you don't get the soundtrack or the little booklet. Is that work the extra price? That would be something you'd want to juggle in your own budget.It's worth noticing of course that here when you buy the game disc you OWN the game disc permanently. Nobody can take it away from you. If you download games onto your Wii from the online store, it's an iffy proposition if that Wii gets destroyed somehow if you're able to download the games onto your new Wii. Also, if you want to go visit at a friend's house and they have a Wii you can bring the disc with you which is easier than bringing along your entire Wii.How do the games play? I adored the originals when I was young so I do still have fun playing these fresh re-releases"" and reliving those memories. It's funny how the brain remembers the sequences after all these years. So I play for nostalgia reasons - but I'm not sure all modern gamers would find the games appealing. It would need to be someone who appreciates the simple graphics and basic gameplay.So to summarize - there's a group of gamers who won't like these games at all. That's fine, certainly these are old games. There's a group who *would* like them for nostalgia reasons but who would rather get them online for less money. That's also fine. Then there's a group who enjoy these games and want to have the disc for portability and backup reasons. For that last group of people, the disc is just what they'll want.Rating: 5/5 for that one group.""",5,Good for Nostalgic Gamers who Need a Backup,2011/4/3 0:00

Since then, NIntendo hasn't just changed the way we play video games with great games and games systems like the Wii and Nintendo 64, but has shown over the years that great games honestly can make the most of great systems. Mario has been no acception, with successful games that've really expanded the game horizons like Super Mario Galaxy, and Super Mario 64, gamers have not only found the most ways that we can play great games, but the excitng challenges of our favorite plumber and his friends, in the strongest escapades and adventures to save Peach from the clutches of Bowser and save not just the mushroom kingdon, but galaxies beyond belief. Now, with Mario's 25th anniversary, Nintendo is going for the silver, with so much in store to celbrate everything Mario, and turning back the clock for Wii owners on a new chance on some old friends from the Mushroom Kingdom.Super Mario All-Stars: Limited Edition is a re-release of the classic Super NES compilation from 1993 that simply reminds people of teh simple and fun quests we've loved everything about Mario. The game includes all of the original games, Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Brothers 2, the definitive and game-changing Super Mario Brothers 3, and the original Super Mario Brothers: The Lost Levels (Super Mario 2 overseas.) The gameplay is just as strong today from these classics, as was back in the original NES days. The gameplay is also just as strong too, as you guide Mario and his friends (Princess Toadstool and Toad in Super Mario 2,) through outrageous levels of maddening mayhem, as he tackles classic foes like Bullet Bills, Koopa Troopas, and the stomping goombas. The graphics have been restored nicely, and the control is just as strong as it was before. While the gameplay is strong, I honestly though wish that there could've been more in the game alone, as we could've seen other Mario classics here like Super Mario World, and Super Mario 64 in the game, but Nintendo has chosen to stay true to not just the original Super Mario All-Stars compilation, but the gameplay too. There also is a nice soundtrack as well, which features a collective array of great songs from te Mario games over the past quarter-century. It is great for die hard Mario fans, and those who've never heard those Mario classics over the years.All in all, Super Mario All-Stars: Limited Edition is a nice compilation that still stands the test of time. While you have had the opportunity to download these games individually through the Wii's virtual console (including the Japanese version of Super Mario Brothers: The Lost Levels) it still works as a nice treat and a great buy for die hard Mario fans, and for those who've not played any of these great Mario games over the years. It is a great buy for the Nintendo Wii, that definitely can still fit down that pipe and lead you to the warp zone of fun.Graphics: BSound: BControl: B 1/2+Fun & Enjoyment: B+ for solo & multiplayer gameplayOverall: B 1/2+",4,Mario Mania,2010/12/5 0:00

A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B004EQCCI4,"Cloud ...""""",3,2,"Remarkable as it is, Naughty Dog has not had a single game that one would call terrible"". While some are considered more worthwhile then others, their track record is pretty impressive. With the release of Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, the team developed a beautiful and fun if a tad derivative game that helped encourage the more ""cinematic"" approach to game design. Then enters Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. Practically a seminal milestone in gaming, beating the game and running into somebody who hadn't played it yet prompted a ""oh man, you've gotta play it!"" reaction. Stunning graphics with believable motion capture, excellent voice acting with some truly stellar set-pieces, I'd almost go and say Uncharted 2 nary has a single fault in its narrative (other than blue cat people but I digress). Which makes walking into the 3rd game, Drake's Deception, kind of a tricky situation I'm sure not only for fans but for the team. Will they try to outdo everything the 2nd game did? Can you really outperform ""perfection""? Well Uncharted 3 is kind of in the middle: it does nearly everything the 2nd game did but better and yet can still leave one with a feeling of deja vu, albeit an impressive deja vu.2 years after the events of Among Thieves, the game opens with Drake and Sully attempting to solve a riddle from one of Sir Francis Drake's voyages, a voyage believed to end with the city of Ubar, the Iram of the Pillars or the ""Atlantis of the Sands"". Drake globetrots from the London underground to a chateau in France to the Arabian desert as he searches for this mystical city, all the while friends around them are questioning why is it that he always pursues reckless endeavors for treasure and doesn't see how it affects his friends and loved ones.The leap from the first game to the second was pretty extraordinary and not just on a graphical front. The seamless transitions of cinematics, gameplay and even events that would've likely been quicktime events or non-interactive was something to behold. That leap to this game isn't as grand a leap since now we pretty much know what Naughty Dog is capable of and while what you're seeing won't have the ""oh my god, how did they even DO this?"" reactions, it's still mighty impressive stuff. A ship capsizing, a burning chateau and a plane getting ripped apart...with you in it are set-pieces that really make Uncharted 3 one of the more visceral and entertaining blockbuster rides of 2011. Although one could think the team just put these moments in there knowing people would look for them so they build excuses in the story to have them, you can't deny these are magnificent parts of the game.However, for a game highly dependent on a scripted and precise order of events, it's very disheartening when you end up dying because you didn't turn a corner fast enough or missed a jump or didn't know what way to go during a chase sequence. It makes for an odd dichotomy since to further the ""it's like a movie"" feel of an Uncharted game, one must rarely die to preserve its flow and yet without prior knowledge of what exactly needs to be done, it can make for a very start/stop kind of structure. Also oddly out of place is that unlike the near flawless pacing of Among Thieves, it's very bizarre to say some parts in Drake's Deception just flat out..., well they kind of suck. A Syrian fortress and a slow beginning as well as certain story elements that are never addressed or properly resolved made me think the game was rewritten a couple of times and certain parts got lost in the shuffle. That still doesn't mean the game doesn't have incredible highs (see preceding paragraph) but the lows are strangely VERY low. Also, the amount of punishment Drake takes is kind of ridiculous. How can a guy go this long without cracking a rib, breaking his fingers or his legs. I mean seriously, dude's like X-Men's Colossus. Hell, even the going-on 60 Sully can keep up with the youthful Drake.But still, if there's one thing you can't knock the team for is presentation and this game is a stunner. Other than one wonky wall texture, everything in the game from the mo-cap to the environments and of course the set-pieces, Uncharted 3 practically bleeds production values. Voice acting as usual is strong and characters are appropriately endearing or love-to-hate-them (but why do Elena and Chloe look worse than before? must be the eyes). The environments are also incredibly gorgeous, whether they're being destroyed or not, and some I'm sure were incredibly difficult to pull off despite the look of the scene.If there's one thing that Uncharted 3 occasionally but not always handles is in the combat which can be strangely frustrating at times. Some of them just drag for too long and even though stealth is encouraged, being caught doesn't mean about 10 or so guys, it becomes a long protracted and tedious firefight as enemies spawn with snipers, grenade launchers and RPG's leading to many out-of-the-blue deaths. And this is a common issue among their forums but the aiming feels...off which was quite noticeable when I actually replayed Among Thieves before I got this to re-accustom myself to Uncharted's gameplay. This also can lead to the ""start/stop"" structure I mentioned before where I can really imagine specific sequences annoying gamers on higher difficulties knowing what a trial they were even on Normal.Brought back from Uncharted 2 is the online modes, the co-op and the multiplayer. In the co-op, it breaks down into 3 groups: Arena, which plays out similarly to Horde mode with the twist being that every wave will have a specific objective such as kills only count when standing in an area or ""Gold Rush"" which is straight up Capture the Flag. There's co-op adventure which has you and 2 players (with strangely downgraded graphics on the character models) going through a little mini-story that's about half hour long or so. Then there's the new mode, Co-Op Hunter which has 2 teams of 2 competing to capture treasure with the villain side gaining some computer AI buddies for assistance. Since all money/XP accumulated goes towards your online profile, you can jump into co-op or the actual online to better your character's unlocks.And the actual multiplayer of Uncharted is indeed kind of a blast. The same basic rules apply: 5 versus 5, jump and climb anywhere you want while you attempt to capture treasures or just straight TDM, free for all, hardcore (no weapon mods or medal kickbacks). Some new elements are introduced such as medal kickbacks which function but don't become acquired the same way as killstreaks. Choosing one kickback, once a certain amount of medals are obtained, pressing Up on the d-pad activates a certain ability such as instantly spawning an RPG in-hand, running faster for a brief time as well as many others. Boosters (or essentially perks) return while weapon mods are added so you can customize a gun to have faster reload, bigger clip or a ""call out"" which highlights enemy names when they're being aimed at so other players can know where they are. Also a new element is what are called ""power plays"" so say the losing team is losing by...a LOT, a power play is brought in to hopefully give that team a chance to catch up.One thing to note is that the game does have an online pass which does NOT include a trial mode to test out the multiplayer so if you're renting the game and you want to test the online and see whether you'd rather buy this then the other big online games out, you're SOL. Buy it brand new or pay 10 more bucks.Remarkable and highly impressive with the occasional blemishes, Uncharted 3 is indeed a great game. The thrills are more impressive albeit familiar but unfortunately this game came after an even better one and while this game I'd recommend someone play without hesitation, it's not the flawless roller-coaster ride as its predecessor.""",5,That old familiar (yet still epic) feeling,2011/11/3 0:00
A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B004EQCCI4,"Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...""",0,0,"The latest in the Uncharted series of adventure-shooters, Uncharted 3 provides more of the same content that the first two games brought.To open up, let me say this: If you've played Uncharted 1 or 2, you know what you're getting for Uncharted 3. It's the same game in new locations: shoot bad guys, solve puzzles, have periodic exciting chase scenes. Even the plot is basically the same overarching concept connected to new treasures and artifacts. Again, if you've played a previous Uncharted game, you know what you're getting with Uncharted 3.For those not familiar with Uncharted, it's a third-person shooter that combines run-and-gun gameplay with parkour-style climbing and occasional puzzle solving. In essence, it's an Indiana Jones movie in game form, and it goes out of its way to be as cinematic as possible. The story of each Uncharted game thus far has been about finding some ancient treasure that turns out to hold a terrible secret; naturally, this game is no different. Overall, the game's single-player is linear but reasonably fun; the story's nothing to write home about, but the combination of character writing and action sequences will keep most players interested.In addition to its single-player game, Uncharted 3 has both competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes. Both of these use a Call of Duty style RPG system, where different perks and traits can be unlocked. While the nature of the unlocking is kind of annoying (because you can't really take what suits your playstyle until you've unlocked them all), it works to provide some additional incentive for playing.The game handles pretty well as shooters go, but it's evident that run and gun is way more emphasized than careful cover shooting. Fisticuffs are a surprisingly effective option as well, but moreso in single-player than in multiplayer. The game stays reasonably fun and frantic, though some parts near the end of the single-player campaign can just be annoying. It's hard to give a more detailed analysis of the gameplay because it's (a) simplistic in general and (b) the same as previous Uncharted games. You duck behind cover, you shoot at people, you run up to someone and punch them in the face, and then you repeat this until the game is over.The game looks incredible, both in terms of actual graphics and setting design and in terms of how the camera is used during gameplay. The game's developer, Naughty Dog"", puts its usual amount of care into the design of ancient temples and crypts, and the game's globe-trotting story ensures that there's plenty of different environments to see. The character models are also incredibly detailed, making the cutscenes feel near-real. One touch that I liked is that during melee combat, at least in single-player, the camera zooms in more and gives it more of an actual fighting game feel. There's some dramatic slow-mo when an enemy is taken down, and the choreography of the fights (while a bit repetitive) is pretty impressive.Overall, Uncharted 3 was an enjoyable game to play, albeit one that seemed a bit standardized at this point. The clearest mechanic I can provide is that if you enjoyed Uncharted 1 & 2, then Uncharted 3 will be a lot of fun. If you didn't, then nothing about UC3 will really change your mind. 8/10.""",4,an enjoyable game to play,2011/11/12 0:00

I won't spoil anything here, but there were some parts that makes you wonder what was the whole purpose of this level?"", once you complete the whole game, you will understand what the developers were trying to do.

AFV2584U13XP3,B004EQCCI4,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),9,6,"If you thought the second one was amazing then the third is going to blow your mind,  the graphics and effects are just astounding I didn't think they could improve the quality from the second game but I've been proven wrong.  Also the controls have pretty much stayed the same so no worries about having to learn new button combos and the like, you'll have the square for melee attacks, triangle for counters, and circle for grabs pretty much the way it was with the first and second game.  The game starts off fast paced as well giving us a standard Sully/Drake confrontation that will introduce us to the main villainess as well as give us some background on the story between Sully and Drake during their early years which is a big plus for us Uncharted fans as we can now see the history between are two beloved treasure hunters.  The audio is spectacular giving us crystal clarity as you listen around you in the levels,  and the humorous dialogue is always good for a laugh as you hear the sarcastic wit that goes between Drake and Sully or as you hear Drake throughout the levels.  The main menu gives you the option of starting the single player storyline,  go online and play multiplayer games scenarios or do a co-op also also you can't help but be amazed at how incredible the cutscenes  look in the game.  I've just started playing the game and I'm just on the early start where we see Drake as a young child so while I haven't finished the game yet I'm just so entertained and appreciative already that I wanted to give my opinion already about the game.  So for all us Uncharted fans out there lets give a shout as we have finally gotten our holy grail at last after waiting for two years and now all I can say is let's hope the fourth Uncharted comes out soon as I definitely can't wait for the continuing journeys of our beloved characters...Update01-11-2012A little update about the bonus features in campaign mode,  while all you'll really get to see at most are the hidden treasures you find throughout the game there has been an update that now allows you to see cutscenes that happened throughout the game like with the previous two Uncharted games.",5,Amazing Followup Of The Series Now We're Just Going To Have To Wait For The Fourth Uncharted,2011/11/1 0:00
A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B004EQCCI4,"Richard Baker BinaryMessiah""""",3,2,"The Good: Riveting scripted events, drop dead gorgeous visuals, smooth and fluid animations and controls, tight gunplay, top-notch voice acting, deep story with great twists, multiplayer suite is a blast, well-balanced flowThe Bad: The same combat issues still exist, can be very difficult in most spots, stealth is flawed, multiplayer is mostly averageThe Uncharted series is really interesting because it was a skeptical Tomb Raider/Indiana Jones knock-off during E3 2005 when Sony showed it off as a new IP for the PS3, but everywhere just kind of blew it off and ignored it. Now we're 6 years ahead and Uncharted is one of the most respected and well like series in gaming history. Uncharted 3 is a solid roller coaster ride of action, suspense, and excellent voice acting that will really keep you sucked in.After the events of Uncharted 2 Drake and Sully find themselves in a fight at a bar with a strange woman wanting Drake's ring. What this ring does and how they get themselves into more trouble will be left for you to find out. The story gives us some history on how the two met as well as being the most dangerous treasure hunt Drake has been on. These guys seriously want blood and they are more viscous and violent than any of Drake's other adversaries.The story isn't anything to balk at because there are some extremely harrowing scripted events, and the characters are just perfect and you get attached to them even more because Naughty Dog brought out a new level for each character (especially Drake) for this big finale.The game is mostly the same combat wise with cover, lots of guns, and explosions. There is a great variety of guns that we love in the series as well as  a few new ones, but combat still has a few issues like snapping into cover doesn't always work, and the game is extremely hard with way too many enemies like in the previous games so this has never been addressed. You will die dozens of times during certain scenes and I really wish they would have fixed this and made it more reasonable and not so difficult. The stealth sections are still poorly designed because you have no idea where to go and there are too many enemies to sneak past or take out silently. One area will be choked up with enemies and if you kill one the next will see you because he's just a few feet away.Despite the combat being the same, the hand to hand is improved and is a blast to use thanks to great animations and quick counters to knock these guys flat.  The platforming and climbing is the same and that's a really good thing. Cleverly laid out levels are really fun to explore because you never really get lost. But what is special about Uncharted are the unique puzzles that span entire levels and are even bigger in this game. They are a little easier to figure out only in the sense that the clues you get can actually be used like they should unlike in the last game where the puzzles were almost impossible to figure out. Each puzzle is completely different from the last, but there aren't as many as in previous games because this one is cut scene heavy, and there is a better balance of shooting, puzzle solving, adventuring, and cut scenes, so the overall flow is more natural.Of course the best part about Uncharted are the scripted scenes and these go way over the top with horseback riding, combat in the air while trying to get into a plane, a battle on a sinking ship, and just a whole bunch more that make the game feel like a blockbuster movie. This was my favorite part of the whole game because it just sucked you into the experience like most games can't do, and I really felt the situations and the danger Drake was in thanks to clever camera work. The visuals are probably the best the PS3 has seen (better than Killzone 3, Resistance 3, and I daresay maybe better than God of War III). The huge open landscapes are just riddled with ridiculous detail that I didn't think the PS3 could even do. Beautiful lighting, high-resolution textures, and the animations are so detailed with Drake tripping over himself, putting his hands on stair rails, so this makes the entire game feel organic and fluid.Uncharted 3's multiplayer is also a blast with unlockable characters, guns, and other goodies to keep you playing. I really like the multiplayer and the style works great, but of course it's nothing to break grounds for online shooters. Co-op single player is a welcome blast, so the whole multiplayer suite involved helps sweeten the already great package. Uncharted will be remembered by myself and most gamers who appreciate and excellent game. The third entry is the perfect ending to an amazing trilogy.Collector's Edition: If you want to spend the extra $40 then you will be treated with everything coming in a beautiful chest (its heavy cardboard unfortunately), as well as a replica of the ring, a belt buckle, and a 6' figure of Drake, plus a special packaging for the game case. The whole collection is beautiful and very well designed, but this is for collectors strictly and people who aren't really hardcore fans of the series should probably pass this up.",5,A gorgeous adventure awaits,2012/3/28 0:00
A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B004EQCCI4,S. Rhodes,37,28,"Uncharted 2 ended up being a smash hit.  Perhaps one of the best video games sequels ever produced.  It was better than the first game in almost every conceivable way.  It's hard to imagine any follow up to Uncharted 2 being half as good but rest assured, Uncharted 3 is just as good as it's predecessor.  If you played the first two games and enjoyed them then you simply have to play Uncharted 3.The story in Uncharted 3 is a bit more rich and defined than the first two games.  Nathan Drake is back and this time he's searching for the Atlantis of the Sands.  It has something to do with the ring he inherited from Frances Drake.  But a woman by the name of Katherine Marlowe believes that ring is hers and it ultimately holds the key to finding this lost city.  On paper Uncharted 3 sounds pretty basic, but watching the story in action showcases a strong character driven narrative.  In particular players will learn more about the dynamic between Nathan Drake and Sully.  The cast is remarkable and charming.  And we learn about them not just through the cutscenes but how they interact with one another during some of the moments in between the actual cutscenes.  The dialog and banter between them is charming, humorous and sometimes even heartfelt.  There are also moments that can, and often do, feel as though they've been ripped from a summer blockbuster.  Though some of it is definitely over the top, the character driven nature of the story is what ultimately makes it so good.  Like the first two there is a distinct human element at play that makes the simple situation an interesting one.The cutscenes are aided by extremely good direction and motion capture as well.  The characters feel human.  But more than that, Uncharted 3 is simply a beautiful game.  The environments the game takes place in are detailed and the animations are smooth.  The Uncharted games in general are some of the prettiest you'll ever see.  But it isn't just that they're visually astounding, it's that their detailed and encompassing.  The environments come alive.  Other details also stand out a lot.  Water or sand is amazing and the way the physics work is also amazing.  If there's one thing we can clearly say about Naughty Dog, it's that they'll never skimp on the presentation of a game.  The voice acting is equally as good and charming.  Some of the best you'll hear in the industry.  As you play and watch the characters interact and hear their voices it's hard not to love them.  You'll be drawn into their personal hell and anguish, but also their joy.  It's all great on the eyes and ears.Gameplay wise, Uncharted 3 hasn't changed too terribly from the first two.  There is a good amount of gunplay, platforming and puzzle solving throughout the adventure and the game does a very good job of balancing them all and pacing things along.  The gunplay in and of itself hasn't changed much.  You'll find yourself charging from one firefight to the next, taking down the bad guys and picking up their weapons or replenishing your own supply of ammo.  You'll also take cover to avoid fire and pop up to shoot when the time is right.  You can also enter melee combat which is fun as well given how much it has improved over time.The platforming sections are generally among the easiest to acquaint yourself with.  You'll find yourself scaling walls or jumping from ledges or hanging off objects all in an attempt to keep yourself from falling too far.  Despite all the detail, the path is usually laid out for you.  This is also true throughout the entire game.  You'll rarely get lost or not know where to go next.  You'll also rarely find yourself backtracking as a result.  Aside from a few of the hidden treasures off the beaten path, there's no reason to really deviate from your destination.  And if something should happen where you find yourself stuck, the game will point you in the right direction.  The puzzles are pretty creative and simple.  You won't find yourself stuck for too long, given that the game will provide hints thanks to a journal that Nate carries around with him.The game handles all of this well, rarely keeping you in any given situation for long.  What is more amusing is how much adventure is truly packed into this game.  The second game, in particular, had amazing moments: A helicopter chase across rooftops, an amazing train sequence, a game of cat and mouse with a large tank and a jeep chase were just some of the second game's highlights.  Uncharted 3 does a little more.  Without spoiling anything, you'll find some of these moments leaving you quite breathless at the spectacle.  It's not the situations themselves that are amazing as it is how the game presents them.  You'll even find yourself scaling and shooting at enemies firing from above and watching as they tumble forward and fall past you.  It's amazing stuff.Without a doubt the biggest overhaul is multiplayer.  Before the versus primarily had you on teams but here you can do a free for all or three teams against each other at the same time.  You still have other modes such as the co-op survival mode or a variation of capture the flag.  You also still have tons of different boosters to equip.  But you can also enter matches with temporary boosters (called kickbacks) which you can get by earning a certain number of medals.  They're not permanent but they help for those who may need that small boost.  Likewise, for those who want a truly hardcore experience you can always go onto the hardcore battle arena.  The maps are also ingeniously designed.  Not only are your opponents people you have to look out for, but so are some of the environmental effects.  In one level a sand storm rolls in, for instance.The most rewarding is the co-op experience.  Sure you can still go into an arena and do a survival mode and whatnot, but there's actually a co-op campaign here as well.  And it's a full blown story campaign, complete with cutscenes and everything.  You can team up with two friends and go at it.  It's remarkably satisfying and pretty addictive.Uncharted 3 isn't perfect by any means.  Like the first two before it, there's a lot of precision in playing.  For example how the game times some of its jumps when say... platforms are falling from beneath you.  Or cutscenes that run seamlessly into gameplay.  If you're not on the ball you may find yourself retrying certain segments constantly.  Some moments can feel like a trial and error practice simply because you don't know WHERE to go immediately and thus you fail until you figure it out.  Since Uncharted 3, like the previous two, is very straightforward and linear you generally only have one option out of a situation.  If you don't find it fast enough in some of the more time sensitive moments you're done for. In other situations your timing may be off by just a second.  Uncharted has always been somewhat of a challenge but most of it comes from the first hand experience.  When you play through a second time things tend to flow more seamlessly when you know exactly where you're going and what you're doing.  The good news is that checkpoints are everywhere.  If you end up failing a platforming section or a gun fight you usually tend to start right next to it.  So the game won't punish you too badly.Uncharted 3 is a great follow up to Uncharted 2.  Whether or not the game is better is up for debate.  The multiplayer suite certainly is, but for some fans who were truly blown away by Uncharted 2, they have to face the fact that the third game isn't exactly the same leap forward that the second one was.  You've got new weapons, a revamped melee system and you can now toss grenades back to your enemies... but for the most part Uncharted 2 didn't have much that needed fixing to begin with.  It was a near perfect game, addressing each and every issue the first game had.  With not much to address there isn't much for Uncharted 3 to really improve upon.  Or add, for that matter.  In seems the only part that Naughty Dog strived for more with was the story.  And they succeeded.  You certainly get a much more emotionally involved story but the gameplay is primarily the same thing here.  If you've enjoyed the gameplay of the series thus far, there's no reason not to jump into this one.  The story and characters alone make this a must play for Uncharted fans.",5,"Frantic, Engaging and Amazing",2011/11/1 0:00
ADLVFFE4VBT8,B004NRN5EO,"A. Dent Aragorn""""",240,217,"Well, these are exaggerations on both counts but... you get the idea.I do not consider myself a hard core gamer but there were a few grand games that I played hard and long on the PS3: Oblivion, Fallout, Grand Turismo, Demon's Souls. Of these, Demon's Souls was the only Platinum I've ever earned and it clocks at over 500 hours of pure fear, strong anxiety and intense frustration punctuated by brief moments of pride and joy brought by the hard earned sweet victories.I started talking about Demon's Souls because to us, PS3 gamers, Dark Souls is NOT the first coming of unspeakable terror onto our consoles. Dark Souls is the SECOND coming. And what a visitation this promises to be :)Okay, here it is, after the first few hours. I am going to post updates (not spoilers) as I progress through the game.THE COMMONSDeomon's Souls has many, never-seen-before, amazing innovations. We hoped and we expected to see most of them again on 'chapter two' and Dark Souls does not disappoint even though Dark's seems to be a Universe unrelated to Demon's. It's not even a parallel Universe (I like to think of parallel Universes as those in which the other fellow Dark Souls players exist - if running around as a hollowed-out soul you can call 'existence'. It's a different world but a lot works in seemingly familiar ways.Here's what I would call the Demon's heritage:- One-save only. And this is a BIG thing because the game saves itself every couple of seconds. Once you get hurt or you hurt someone you didn't mean to you can't go back to the previous save because there's no such thing. Unless you have one hand on the power cord ready to pull it, everything you do has consequences and you can't go back and try again. Be VERY careful when you talk to them merchants or blacksmiths because one unintended slap and they will never deal with you again.- Human vs. Soul form. Can't be invaded by other players while in Soul (Hollow) form. As a Human you can invade other words, help others, seek help.- Classes. You pick yours from 10. Not exactly the same as in Demon's though.- Stats. Again, 10 different categories, some differently named, some totally new like 'humanity' and 'attunement'.- The ability to seek help and to help others. I believe that you can have up to 3 others helping.- The Stones. They are of different colors but they have uses not unlike the Demon's stones, possibly more: to seek help, to leave messages, to invade.- Souls as currency of the land and the price price you must pay to level up. And you lose them all every time you die so... use them (buy, uplevel) before you lose them.- Every time you rest all non-boss enemies respawn.- The ability to play nasty and invade other players' worlds.- Blood stains. You can see how others died.- Second (and ONLY second) chance. You can recover lost souls if you can touch your own blood stain before you die again.- Messages. Can leave messages but don't expect to be able to type away detailed clues. You pick your message from a pre-approved list.- Incredibly precise combat. Each class of weapons acts differently and you can see/feel the difference between hitting flesh, bone or armor.- Uchigatanas!!! Need I say more? These are by far the coolest katanas you'll ever swing in any game and probably the best you can get through this one at least through mid-game. Demon Souls most terrifying black phantoms (invading players) where the 2-Uchigatana dudes. Most, possibly all of the Demon's weapons can be found in Dark: Claymores, Halberds, Clubs, Axes, Estocs and so forth.- Practice makes perfect. Like Demon's Souls, this is a struggle for perfection because in most instances only perfect or near-perfect attacks and defenses will save you from yet another horrific death.- Continues the Deomon's tradition of no difficulty levels. Like its predecessor, there's only one difficulty level on Dark and that's 'very easy', as in 'very easy to get yourself killed'. Seriously, for anyone who played Demon's, Dark feels like the second or third playthrough only you start at a low level, have no weapons or armor and find yourself in completely unfamiliar territory now so it takes a little bit of dying, observing and experimenting before your learn the ropes.THE DELTAS (new and never seen before)This, I'm sure, is going to be a growing list and I'm going to update it as I progress into the game. If what's going on in this game can be called 'progress'.- One-world design. This appear to be a huge world but gates, bridges and passes are all well guarded so be prepared to shed a lot of blood and die a lot to earn your right of passage. Unlike Demon's which had a hub that was the only connection between the several separate 'worlds', Dark's world regrions are very much interconnected and much of the fun and mystery is your gradually discovering and unlocking sometimes secret doors and passages.- The healing system. The role of 'grasses' is drastically reduced (there are some mosses that you can still use to cure ailments) but Dark doesn't make it as easy when it comes to your ability to recover health. It's no longer near-unlimited.- The Covenants. Each of the 9 will open new play modes and, as always, every action brings about consequences. Joining may appear an easy decision but separation can be painful and costly.- Pyromancy as a THIRD class of magic, joining sorcery and miracles. For anyone who likes fire and explosions... it's awesome.- The Gifts. Interestingly some seem to have no effect while others such as the Magic Key you get if you pick the class of Thief is quite useful.- Danger times 2. It may be just because I'm a little rusty playing Souls or because I know Demon's so well now it's like a walk in the park but Dark appears to be a lot harder. But... we play, we learn. We shall see :)- More color. Can't imagine Demon's with colors but in this world the occasional bright splashes blend well and don't subtract from the feeling of danger.- No Luck. You COULD get lucky in Deomon's Souls but that's no longer the case. That particular stat has disappeared, replaced by your ability to hold 'humanities' which you lose every time you die.- Sweet revenge. One of the covenants mission is to hunt down and kill those nasty dark phantom bullies.- And, of course, Dark Souls does away with all the gentleness and hand-holding occasionally found in Demon's. It really does. Remember that nice Russian lady in the Nexus that you must kill if you want your Platinum? Gone! My first impressions: don't trust anyone because everybody seems to be either evil or insane.THE STORYNot quite sure what's expected of me yet and I don't think I should spoil anyone's fun anyway. There is a prologue, of course and, clearly, terrible things happened that caused this not to be a happy world. Need to investigate some more but I'm not sure who's to be trusted, who should be used, who can be a friend.MY RATINGIf Amazon's 5 stars stands for 'I love it', what would be the star count for I love it, I fear it and, 80 hours into the game I'm obsessed by it""? Well... 5's the limit :). I expect to spend hundreds of hours playing this game and, hopefully, with a little or maybe a lot of help from my friends and a lot of priceless advice from some of the game-focused sites - I will name my favorites on a comment to this review.__________________________________________July 2012 Update:Several months and several hundreds hours of gameplay later, I'm still playing Dark Souls.Sure, I 'beat' the game so many times already but finishing the game the first time is only the beginning. Then you play 'new game plus' (NG+), then NG++, NG+++ and so on where everything gets harder and harder. Can't get the platinum trophy unless you go through the game at least twice.And there's the PvP (player vs. player) which is where, with your most deadly or your most fun character built to much your skills you can face other players in everything ranging from helping out a fellow player beat a boss or a fair 1v1 fight where players bow to each other in the beginning and pay their respects to the defeated one once the fight is over to no-rules melees where magic and poison knives fly, buffed greatswords or halberds hit hard and you may face up to 3 players plus whatever the game may be throwing at you at the same time. The fun never ends, the variety is almost endless and it's addictive.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;""",5,You only live twice (with a million deaths in between),2011/10/4 0:00
A2LPJD19MGBNXJ,B004NRN5EO,"Adrian Jenkins southerndudeman""""",2,2,"When I first reviewed Demon's Souls, way back when, I was somewhat flabbergasted by the heaping praise it received. Yes, I liked the game very much (more for the SP experience than the MP one), but there were things that bothered me (and bother me still).Dark Souls, in SP, improves in every conceivable way, from the huge, open (if restricted) environment, to the towering bosses, to the much-improved story delivery. There are still a couple of complaints, but all in all, Dark Souls reminds me that yes, Japanese role-players do have the ability to evolve and thrive in the west, despite their sinking fortunes.The idea of Dark Souls is similar to Demon's souls, in that you are a lone individual trying to make his (or her) way in a harsh world not of your choosing. In this incarnation, you are Undead"", which means that after death, you will be revived, again and again. It also means that at some point, you will lose your mind and become a shell of a being (cleverly called a ""Hollow""). The undead are now a nuisance in the world, and and thus herded into a sanctuary in the unforgiving land of Lordran. Within Lordran roam horrible demons and hollow uncountable, and your quest is to make your way in this world, acquiring power, souls and ""Humanity"", which I will describe later. Ultimately, you will make decisions which will shape the world itself.After a nifty opening sequence, you are thrust into this world with only the barest of weapons. From there, it is up to you to make your way. You can move in many directions (after an initial tutorial stage), some harder than others. Some directions will lead to story arcs that will never be known if you follow the beaten path. However, those directions are often much more difficult, particularly for a first-time adventurer. The game is long (expect to put 50 hours into an initial playthrough), but it never feels long. Death is expected (the game advertised that you should ""Prepare to Die""), but it rarely feels undeserved (although it often feels unfair). After each death, you are returned to the last checkpoint you encountered (which appear as bonfires, which are good and bad). Combat is stellar, with many different play styles allowed. For first-timers, I find that playing a mage is easiest (though harder than playing a mage in Demon's Souls), but I find that melee is much more rewarding, particularly against the bosses.The bosses are a varied lot, and for the most part, are stellar. There is one clear misstep (the Bed of Chaos is little more than cheap nonsense meant only to frustrate the gamer, much like the Dragon God in Demon's Souls), but the other bosses stand out. Even bosses that seem to repeat will have new attacks, or new wrinkles. For example, you'll encounter enemies like the Asylum Demon in the tutorial twice more, but his later incarnations will have gained new magic abilities, or AoE attacks, which will have you throwing your controller. Some of the final bosses (such as the 4 Kings, or Gwyn) are just stellar battles.Normal enemies can be brutally dangerous. In one section, you will fight the lower halves of multiple dragon zombies, while walking through lava which damages you over time. In another, you'll fight ghosts which can only be harmed if you are cursed, either temporarily or permanently. And, like ghosts often do, they can pass through walls, or ceilings, and gang up on you when you least expect it.If the battles get too intense, you can always take some time to summon someone to help (provided that you have regained your human form, which is not always easy). Up to three people can help you. On the flip side, when you are human, you may also be invaded by other players who want your humanity. These battles are often difficult, so be cautious (or play offline).The story of this game is great. However, the player has to work to learn it. Story is given in small amounts, from item descriptions, to conversations that will change over time, often for subtle reasons. For example, that cleric you meet at the beginning of the game might be hiding a deadly secret, which can only be learned if you pay a murderous knight a huge bounty of souls. I love the way the story is delivered, but others may not.If I had one gripe with this game, it is the notion of humanity. In Demon's Souls, there were clear benefits and detriments to being in human form, as opposed to soul form. In human form, your HP doubled (at least), but you could be invaded by phantoms. In soul form, you suffered fewer hit points (and often other penalties, depending on how you played the game), but you were guaranteed completely silent movement. In Dark Souls, the only real difference in being pre-hollowed and being human was the fact that you could not be invaded. You suffered no other real penalties (yes, you can't kindle bonfires, but that's not such a big deal, since many of them are kindled for you already). So, what's the point in gathering all of this humanity? Yes, humanity is useful in certain covenants, but outside of trophy-hunting, the rewards were less than stellar. In the SP experience, there is no good reason not to play in your hollowed form for the entire game.But that's a minor quibble. In short, I love Dark Souls, having played through it no fewer than 10 times across three accounts. I find that it is both more difficult than Demon's Souls, and more fun. If this is your cup of tea, you can't go wrong, particularly for twenty bucks.""",4,An improvement on an already-great game,2012/10/31 0:00
A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B004NRN5EO,"Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...""",2,2,"The spiritual sequel to the cult hit Demon's Souls"", ""Dark Souls"" combines the challenging hack-and-slash gameplay of its predecessor with a more open world and greater difficulty.""Dark Souls"" is a third-person action-RPG set in a grim fantasy world. Those who have played its predecessor, ""Demon's Souls"", will find that almost all of the basic mechanics are the same. As a refresher for those who haven't, Dark Souls' gameplay involves defeating enemies by dodging their attacks with blocking and rolling, then countering with sword slashes, bow shots, or magic spells. Unlike most RPGs, Dark Souls is an action game first and foremost - closer to games like the Legend of Zelda than most other RPGs. Defeating enemies provides the player with Souls, a currency used to upgrade the player-character's abilities or purchase items. The game's main defining trait is its difficulty; death comes quickly, and dying takes all of your currently-held souls (i.e. those not spent on upgrades or items). The game's tagline is ""Prepare to Die"", and if a player goes into the game expecting a cakewalk they are in for a rude surprise.The main difference between Demon's Souls and Dark Souls is the nature of the world. In Demon's Souls, the player began in a Nexus that allowed them to teleport to different worlds to defeat bosses. In Dark Souls, the whole world is one big connected map in a manner akin to games like Metroid or Castlevania. Therefore, exploration is far more important, whether it's to find the next area or to find shortcuts back to previous ones. The world of Dark Souls is littered with ""bonfires"", safe areas that restore health and allow you to manage your experience, inventory, magic, and so on. These bonfires are also the only way to fill your ""Estus flasks"", one of the only means of healing available in the game, so conserving resources is more important than in Demon's Souls. This adds to the difficulty mostly because using a bonfire respawns all enemies in the world, so it's possible to run out of healing supplies before you've reached a boss and be forced to go all the way back and try again. The amount of Estus a bonfire provides can be increased by feeding it ""humanity"", a resource that can be acquired by defeating enemies or helping other players in co-op play, but there's an upper limit to how much Estus can be carried.While exploration and a certain amount of freedom does exist in the game, there's also some things that must be done in a linear fashion (or at least mostly linear). Bosses, for example, will often block hallways that cannot be passed until the boss is defeated. This can be frustrating if you're having trouble with the first few bosses, but after about the first hour of play the world opens up a bit more and allows you to always have somewhere else to explore to improve your character and your weaponry. In some ways it's more linear than Demon's Souls, because you HAVE to defeat certain bosses to progress (whereas in Demon's Souls it was possible to skip entire worlds as long as you got the bare minimum necessary to face the final boss), but in other ways it's more open by allowing you to explore areas that you never even NEED to go.The game's combat is similar to Demon's Souls, but a bit more developed. The enemies are definitely tougher and more aggressive, even at the beginning of the game. Two new additions to the player's melee arsenal are the ability to kick (useful for knocking an enemy back) and do a jumping slash (useful for covering ground more quickly). In general, though, it's the same basic concepts of dodge, block, attack. The bosses are a bit less diverse than Demon's Souls' bosses, and more frustrating as well. One particular frustration is the fact that both the character's weapons and most enemy weapons will bounce back if they hit walls, meaning that slashing in a narrow corridor is a bad idea and stabbing weapons will have an advantage. However, certain bosses (and one boss in particular) don't play by those rules, meaning that fights against those bosses are mostly a guessing game as to whether a particular hit is going to connect or not. On the other hand, there are some boss fights that are so well-done and exciting that they make up for the bad ones. One boss fight killed me three or four times, but was so enjoyable to fight that I didn't mind having to go all the way back to it. The game's difficulty means that overcoming a fair boss can be exhilarating, but having to put up with a poorly-designed boss can simply be frustrating.The multiplayer aspect of the game is similar to previous games, and comes in both cooperative and competitive modes. The cooperative mode is achieved by summoning players (or being summoned), allowing multiple characters to fight through one player's campaign. The competitive element is the option of invading another player's world. Players can only summon other players, or be invaded by other players, while in ""human"" form (and being able to summon or be invaded is the only benefit of being in human form), so if you don't want to be invaded it's perfectly possible to just never turn human. Complicating the multiplayer relationship is the ""Covenant"" system. Covenants can be joined by finding certain NPCs in the game world, and each covenant has different objectives. One covenant randomly invades those who are marked as criminals in the game's system (i.e. those who invade other players or break their own covenants). Another covenant exists to invade the worlds of players who enter a specific forest in the game world. The ""basic"" covenant, the Way of White, makes it easier to find friendly players and harder to be invaded.The game's graphics and designs are as impressive as Demon's Souls' were. The designs are grounded but still fantastic, and the scale of the game is amazing. The whole world is interconnected, and it's easy to see this wherever you are. From the highest towers, you can see all the way to the lowest ravines, and the areas are huge to begin with. In many cases it's easy to figure out where you should go next just by looking around in the game world. Like in Demon's Souls, the game's music is limited to boss fights, making the ""exploring the world"" part of the game more quiet and dramatic and the ""combat"" parts more intense.Overall, Dark Souls is a worthy successor to Demon's Souls, and any fan of Demon's Souls should check it out. The main things that might limit its appeal is its difficulty; while most players view it as being ""hard but fair"", it's easy to imagine the average player becoming frustrated at their repeated deaths and having to play through sections over again. If you're not up for a challenge, Dark Souls is more annoying than it's worth, but if you ARE, it's a fantastic game that can be well worth the effort it requires. 9/10.""",5,challenging hack-and-slash gameplay,2011/11/12 0:00

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B004NRN5EO,S. Rhodes,29,21,"A couple of years ago a game called Demon's Souls came around and was met with surprising praise.  The reputation of Demon's Souls was that it was a ridiculously hard game.  Those who played it and survived were quite passionate about the game.  While those frustrated with it were equally passionate.  Regardless Demon's Souls became a success.  Dark Souls serves to be the spiritual successor.  And it makes one thing clear right off the bat.  You will die.  Several times.  And it's not exaggerating that.You'll begin the game by creating your character and choosing between an assortment of classes.  Each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  While initially it's important to keep this in mind because of how the different stats vary, you'll eventually find enough equipment and items to really experiment with the class.  But for the beginning this is your chance to figure out just how you want to play Dark Souls.  You can be a well rounded warrior for instance or you can start off as a tank of a Knight... or a heavy hitting bandit or evasive thief.  Or, if you're really gutsy you could choose to be deprived at the start where things ramp up considerably in the beginning.After that you'll awaken in an asylum.  There isn't much story given to you at the start of Dark Souls.  What becomes obvious, however, is that you're playing a very different kind of dungeon crawler.  Dark Souls has a small tutorial where you'll be able to learn the basics of combat.  And you'll definitely want to take this time to read the messages scrawled about and learn the mechanics of the game.  Because it's not long after that Dark Souls cuts you lose and you're on your own.  And for the most part combat strings itself together really well.  In several games the goal is about hacking and slashing through a ton of your opponents without much regard to what your doing.  This approach will get you killed in Dark Souls.  Combat is surprisingly strategic.  It isn't just about landing blows but learning how to effectively dodge, strife, block, parry and go for the counter attack.  Each of the game's various enemies have different approaches to them and different strategies.  The game is incredibly challenging but it adds on newer challenges at a decent enough pace.The game is, however, unapologetic about it's difficulty.  Whenever you complete a specific area or down a boss you'll feel more accomplished than you've ever felt.  And the rewards are usually worth it.  You will find yourself in moments where you may have to grind.  Each time you defeat enemies you gain souls which go toward leveling up your class.  If you should die, you'll lose all your souls, though.  You can easily continue, though, and if you manage to make it to your corpse before you die again you can regain all the souls you've lost.The good news is that not everything done in Dark Souls has to be done alone.  You can invite others into your world to help you.  But more than that, Dark Souls utilizes a fantastic online component that most games don't offer (except for Demon's Souls).  The first is that you can view apparitions of other players who may have tackled specific tasks.  You can see what happened to them just the same.  The other aspect that's nice is that you can leave messages to other players.  Warning them of upcoming threats or giving them tips.  You can also rate how helpful they were giving them a longer time to be around.  The point is that it is a community effort.  All you need to experience this is an online connection.  Playing Dark Souls in offline mode makes the game a daunting one to play through.  You won't get many of those helpful tips and you won't see any spirits of players who have already been where you are.  The online aspect of Dark Souls is easily the best part about it.  Especially because after the first small dungeon, the game pretty much lets you loose and doesn't offer to really teach you anything beyond that.  You're at a point where you'll either be learning on your own or relying on other players to help you along the way.It all comes together really well.  The strategic combat and the way the online works make Dark Souls feel like a one of a kind game.  The only major downside is that so many gamers may just find it to be too difficult.  If you're an easily frustrated gamer, Dark Souls may not be for you.  You'll find yourself dying several times.  The bosses hit unusually hard and if you don't take the right approach to the right enemy they'll do you in easily.  Some areas also feel like trial and error.  If you don't take the hints you're given to heart, Dark Souls is going to punish you several times.  The good news is that once you really figure out what your doing the challenge becomes less mitigating.  But you'll die several times before this happens.  And just when you master taking down a certain enemy, the game introduces you to new ones.  Of course the end result is that you feel like you actually accomplished something the further you get.  Dark Souls just requires patience and meticulous strategy to get through.There are other things that make the game difficult as well.  Everything about it is treated as though you are online.  This means that you can still be attacked by enemies even if you're in the menu.  You can't really pause"" the game, you can only find specific safe havens away from combat such as bonfires which serve as checkpoints where you can rest and heal up as well as level up or your character.  Another aspect that can add to the difficulty is that other players can ""invade"" your game and engage you in combat.  The good news is that the game tries its best to balance things.  Often times you'll be invaded by someone of your own level.  And you usually have a chance to escape from them.  The emphasis, however, is definitely on helping out other players rather than competing against them.Dark Souls is also a gorgeous game.  In fact, from a production standpoint it's hard to really find any fault with the game.  The environments are detailed and varied.  The atmosphere is always setting the right tone, and best of all the music compliments it all brilliantly.  There is also a lot of great voice acting to accompany things.  It's a gorgeous game all around.The difficulty might be a bit much for some gamers, but those who undertake the challenge and meet it head on are in for a treat.  It's a well crafted game that offers up an experience unlike anything else you've seen.  If you're looking for a decent challenge then Dark Souls is the game for you.""",5,Prepare to Die,2011/10/5 0:00

This one is coming from Syphon Filter (for PSP) vets Bend Studios instead of Naughty Dog. We follow the hero Nathan Drake as he uncovers a 400 year-old massacre and travels through various dangerous locales to get there. Of course this isn't an Uncharted without some bad guy trying to get the fortune all for himself, but this time there is two, so this makes it a race. A new heroine is introduced as Marisa Chase, but fans will come to not like her as much as previous females in the series due to her lack of charm and charisma. The overall experience is the same as the PS3 versions, but with some added features exclusive to Vita.The story itself doesn't tread any new ground besides carving a new adventure. It isn't as deep as the last two Uncharted games (Among Thieves and Drake's Deception) because it doesn't explore anything about Drake's past, or push his character any. The game felt a lot like the first one, and that's fine, but the Vita version could have been a lot more. The combat and platforming hasn't changed at all, but what's here works well. If you are familiar with Uncharted`s gameplay already you won't need to learn anything new except the Vita features. You can climb around handholds as normal, but you can paint"" your path with the touchscreen which is helpful during long shimmys. You can use the touchscreen to climb ropes (as well as the rear touch pad), as well as accessing menus.Thanks to the second analog stick you won't have camera trouble, and this also includes combat. Gun fights feel just like the PS3 versions, but hand-to-hand uses the touchscreen. You can press the fist icon on the enemy or just use square. The final blow is laid by a swipe direction on the touchscreen. In fact all quick time events are done with the touchscreen. This doesn't really add anything significant, but it is a nice touch and makes use of the technology. The tilt sensor is used to balance yourself on beams and the gyroscope is used to fine tune your aim. These features are just subtle touches, but it doesn't really make the game any easier.Golden Abyss has 34 chapters, but the game can be beaten in about 4-5 hours if you aren't looking for collectibles. There are tons of them, and without a walkthrough you won't find them all. This includes taking photos and doing charcoal rubs with the touchscreen. This is probably the best use of the touchscreen because it fits so well into the Uncharted gameplay and setting. The story is delivered with excellent voice acting, and the dialog is top-notch with Drake's sarcastic and snarky comments. There are some interesting puzzles that use the touchscreen, but they are easy and not as challenging as the console versions.The visuals are a real treat, and is probably the best looking handheld game to date on any platform ever. The lighting effects and highly detailed textures are unrivaled on any other portable device. It doesn't look as good as the PS3 versions, but it looks very close to the first Uncharted graphics wise. There are various locations to gawk at such as night caves, lush jungles, and dense villages.After you beat the main game there really won't be any reason to come back except to find the collectibles and unlock trophies. The story is entertaining, but not nearly as memorable as the console versions, but this Uncharted is lacking one huge thing that brings it down so much: Epic set pieces. Uncharted is famous for this and there isn't a single one in the entire game. No exciting train chases, or anything like that. It feels too familiar to the basic gameplay and doesn't stray far from that path.

Uncharted Golden Abyss looks absolutely gorgeous.  You've never seen anything like this on a handheld system before.  The graphical power is amazing, the environments detailed.  From a production standpoint it's almost like you've got a little PS3 in your pocket.  And the voice acting is also incredibly strong.  Just about everything you'd want from an Uncharted game is there.  The writing is also strong as always.  There will be moments where you'll laugh as the characters interact and speak with one another.  From the standpoint of production Golden Abyss is unrivaled by anything you've ever seen on a handheld before.Likewise, the story is good, although not quite as absorbing as the console games.  Once again Nathan Drake is searching for a lost city, but this time he's with a friend named Jason Dante.  Were it not for the strong characters and some of the wit and charm Uncharted was known for, the story wouldn't be nearly as fun.  And this is primarily because the outings we've seen of Drake thus far, have usually involved searching for lost cities (or starting out that way, only to lead to something bigger).  Golden Abyss isn't really any different.  It is going to be familiar to fans.In fact, quite a bit will be familiar to fans.  It's got all the standard Uncharted tropes.  There are the nice elements of puzzles, platforming and gun fights.  Again, all familiar elements to fans.  But what makes them work is how the game is able to actually mesh them together.  It allows for ample breaks between the action where you can slow down and deal with a puzzle or perhaps just do some platforming.  It's hard to say how exciting Golden Abyss is, however, especially because Uncharted 3 just dropped down not too long before, and there are not quite as many amazing set pieces as what we saw in the third installment.  There's nothing here that will amaze you quite like Uncharted 2's fantastic train sequence or Uncharted 3's fantastic ocean liner sequence.  That's not to say there isn't excitement.  It's only to say the moments just aren't nearly as tense.Likewise, like every Uncharted game, the entire campaign is pretty straightforward.  Having you run from one moment to the next.  You'll never have to worry about where to go next or if you'll get lost.  It also means you'll never have to worry about backtracking.  There are also lots of checkpoints scattered around freely so there's not much to befall you if the worst should happen.  It sticks to many of Uncharted's tried and true approaches.In terms of the technology itself, Uncharted Golden Abyss manages to do quite a bit with the Playstation Vita's technology.  This game utilizes the touch screen a lot.  You'll use it to cut down bamboo in your way, for instance, making quick swipes on the screen.  You'll use it to finish off melee combos in the middle of combat.  You'll also use it for some of the puzzles.  During the platforming moments you can touch the spots you want Nate to go to next.  At first all this seems rather pleasant.  After a while you don't care for it as much.  The platforming, for instance, was never much of a challenge in Uncharted to begin with.  Being able to touch where Nate goes doesn't really add anything to the experience.  It certainly doesn't detract, but it's there mainly to show it can be done rather than because it's actually integral to the experience of the game itself.  The same could be said for some of the swipes in melee combat or for the bamboo.  They're not really adding too much to the game itself.  They just seem like bits thrown in to show what the Vita can do.  After a while you begin to feel like they're tacked on.  Gunfights are certainly easier with the controls, but once again you won't feel as though you need them.It's not that the touch screen controls are bad, it's just that the more you play the game, the more it just feels like the game could've been competent enough without them.  There aren't many moments when you feel like the controls are actually necessary at any given time.  They certainly make much of the experience easier... but Uncharted was never that hard to begin with.  It's just hard to get beyond the fact that some of the touch screen controls feel like a novelty rather than a necessity.  And the fact that the game can't be played 100% without them when that novelty wears off is a little disappointing.That does not detract from Uncharted Golden Abyss by that much.  You'll wonder if it was necessary to have all those controls, sure, but you'll be able to deal with them.  What is a little hard to deal with is that the campaign just isn't as exciting as the PS3 games.  The campaign isn't very long by any means, but there's not much reason to want to go through it again.  There's also no multiplayer suite for when the adventure is done.Fans will settle right into things and be delighted.  Some moments aren't nearly as tense or as memorable as what you saw in the games on the Playstation 3.  And some of the touch screen controls can feel tacked on, but the overall package is still good.  Especially if you're looking to show what the PSV can really do.  Uncharted: Golden Abyss is a pretty game with some of the best production values you've ever seen on a handheld.  It's charming and fun.  It's a great addition to the Uncharted series.",4,Not to Be Lost in the Abyss,2012/2/29 0:00
A2IGEPJJYKMOWK,B0050SW8OS,UziHorowitz,0,0,"Golden Abyss combines the setting and feel of the first game, Drake's Fortune, then sprinkles in some polish seen in the second game, Among Thieves. Similar to Drake's Fortune, Golden Abyss is more scaled back when it comes to set piece level design and opts for something a little more restrained. However, do not take this as a fault, as Golden Abyss is quite frankly one of the most enjoyable Uncharted adventures to date.It's not developed by Naughty Dog, but it is developed by Sony Bend, who proved their game development mastery with games such as Resistance Retribution, Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror, Syphon Filter: Logan's Shadow, etc. Sony Bend is more than capable of delivering a full-on Uncharted experience in handheld form, and Golden Abyss is all the proof you need.This is a phenomenal Uncharted game brought to a handheld with wonderful graphics, witty and interesting storytelling, good characters, nice gameplay, etc. If you're an Uncharted fan and want to know the events before Drake's Fortune, buy Golden Abyss and I think you'll be very satisfied with what you're getting.",5,The Adventure Your Vita Craves,2012/2/28 0:00
A1TY4TRLA4QK5Y,B0050SX7BQ,"Brian Long Brian""""",7,7,"Beyond Two Souls is the latest work of Quantic Dream, who make the curious decision to place story, environments, and characters beyond gameplay upgrades. You play a duo of a little girl and her pet poltergeist soul-bound hanger on as you work through her life of being experimented on and the happy trails that follow. Or maybe you're trained by the CIA for perfectly normal"" work.Gameplay is awesome with Aiden, the poltergeist. You don't have much beyond scouting and knocking things over, but you'll be surprised how absorbing that can be, and how difficult it is to keep in mind when you're fleeing police or are wracking your brain about a piece of info you need. What makes it awesome is there is real choice. You can even be a brat in the tutorial level and the game will just move on rather than go ""you must prove that you're paying attention."" Combat is a bit frustrating even though its simple. You tap in a particular direction or manipulate the controller itself. Whats annoying is you are supposed to gage which motion is being made while its happening. Is that straight kick to the groin a right motion, or technically up? And when you make a wrong choice, it doesn't give much in the way of notice what should have been correct. Balancing this is at least you have to slipup several times to really be punished.Voices and environments are wonderful if a tad narrow in scope. Some stages flee like a set of canal locks, but while you're drifting along the current stretch, its awesome to stop and smell the roses. Characters have full side conversations and don't stop to bask in you PC glow when you get close enough to hear what they're talking about.Nits are few and far between with one exception. While the super simple interface is nice, its so simple that its sometime a trial to find the white dot that you actually can interact with on that white door. You have to be standing in the right spot and push in the right direction, though this doesn't happen nearly as often during crucial moments, just during exploration. Other than that limited and still workable flaw, this is a highly polished, basically flawless diamond.Update: I tend not to play the entire story start to finish before writing a review, but the ending for this was so hollow it lost two stars just for it. Its not as bad as ME3, but the final run up is remeniscent of Quantic Dreams massive story failure with Indigo Prophecy. The end doesn't tie in with the rest of the story well, the premise is really destroyed by trying to explain it, which just opens up massive amounts of plot holes. The main villian shows up in a total of 3 scenes, and you don't even realize he was supposed to be the villian until moments before he dies, and on and on. Its obvious that they intended to include 10-20 hours more story, because there's just so, so much that's not explained, but its slapped in your face to the point that it still demands an explanation. Trying not to provide spoilers, but when you finally learn how Jodie got her powers you're just like ""What?.... That happens all the time!"" QD had a massive hit with Heavy Rain, but nearly snatched defeat from the jaws of certain victory with this.""",3,"Superb story and awesome gameplay, but falls apart",2013/10/9 0:00

They started out with Indigo Prophecy (or Fahrenheit for Europeans) and it was an interesting concept that was executed surprisingly well. Heavy Rain was the same way with a fantastic story and multiple choices that can change the ending. Using just various button presses to play the game could seem boring, but when the action picked up it got pretty intense. You had a split second to press the various buttons to make the characters flee for their lives or fight off enemies. Beyond feels like a spiritual successor to both those games, but is less interactive than the other two.You play as a girl named Jodie (Ellen Page) who has an entity named Aiden attached to her. She can control him to do anything from knock down a box to possessing someone and making them commit suicide. You bounce back and forth from her childhood to her adulthood where she&#8217;s being taken care of by a scientist named Nathan Dawkins (Willem Dafoe) and also when she&#8217;s in the CIA. This may seem confusing because the storyline is told in a random pattern, but it makes perfect sense. The story is well-balanced and easy to follow and there&#8217;s some great plot twists and changes.Like Heavy Rain you can wander around and do things, but there&#8217;s less optional interaction like in Heavy Rain. You will rarely find stuff to interact with just for the heck of it. When things start getting intense you will need to keep Jodie alive by following her movements in slow motion. The action will slow down a bit and you need to press the right analog stick in the direction that Jodie is moving. Some times this is hard to gauge due to an odd camera angle or her movements are too subtle. I never died through the game though, but slower reacting people may find the action sequences frustrating. That&#8217;s kind of where things become a problem. You will engage in a tense action sequence only to hit a chapter where you&#8217;re making dinner for Jodie&#8217;s date. There are some really dull and slow moments in Beyond and too many odd inconsistencies.Like the mentioned scene above I had to pick up clothes, cook dinner, and get Jodie ready for her date. This was slow, dull, and the inconsistencies drove me nuts. After putting dinner on the stove I wandered around (the characters control like awkward tanks) I took a shower, watched her drink some old beer, helped her pick out a dress, and the whole time (about 30 in game minutes) the food sat in the pan not being touched and it never burned. One scene towards the end has Jodie and her 3 CIA agents in North Korea tracking down a Condenser which is a rift to the Infraworld (the other side). They leave a house and do a lookout on a base but one guy is missing for about 3 scenes and it&#8217;s never explained where he went. Then he just appears out of nowhere.Controlling Aiden is also another problem because the levels are hard to navigate. The rooms and hallways all look the same and you will get lost often. Aiden controls like a no clip camera with a fisheye lens. He&#8217;s just a floating spirit attached to Jodie. Your goal is to look for blue dots to attach to and use both stick to slam stuff around, possess bodies, knock stuff over, and distract people. He&#8217;s kind of the puzzle side to the game. When I first played as Aiden he was nearly impossible to control and I almost threw up for how frustrated I got. Later on I learned to get used to it, but this could have been done better.Of course the game is all about the story and choices and there are quite a few, but in the end the choices are pretty much predefined. Depending on who you keep alive or befriend you get to choose who you stay with or a couple of other endings selections. They seem cookie cutter and your little tiny choices didn&#8217;t really make a difference. Again, more inconsistencies. Besides the choices the CIA portions were the worst and felt unnecessary for the game. It was just an excuse to add more action and close down these three condensers throughout the world. The more memorable moments were when Jodie was a kid and when Jodie had more one on one experiences with people as an adult like when she was homeless.The game does look damn good though, in fact one of the best looking games of this generation, it almost looks next-gen. The voice acting and motion capture is unlike anything we&#8217;ve seen this generation. Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe do an amazing job in their roles, but I can&#8217;t help but notice flaws due to the hardware limitations. Some facial expressions look overdone, some textures look muddy and downright ugly. There is skipping when the game is loading, but it&#8217;s all minor stuff.Overall, Beyond: Two Souls is 15 hours long, but is filled with boring scenes that are there just to extend play time. The CIA missions are boring and out of place and there are many annoying inconsistencies with events in some scenes. The game look fantastic and the acting is superb, so this is a very entertaining weekend rental and nothing more. Don&#8217;t come here looking for action because timed button presses are all you&#8217;re going to get.",4,Not as great as Heavy Rain but one of the PS3's last great games,2014/4/9 0:00

Rhodes,6,3,"The Good:+Amazing production values+A fairly good story+An amazing soundtrackThe Bad:-Some very clunky controls-There are many moments where what you do as a player makes absolutely no difference.  Even sitting idly by and watching events results in the game simply pressing forward without the player suffering any consequences---NOTE: The Following Review is LengthyQuantic Dream is best known for producing the very well done Heavy Rain.  The storytelling and real sense of choice in the game made Heavy Rain stand out.  There was no such thing as a game over.  Even if characters perished or you didn't do something a certain way, the course of the game could change a lot.  Beyond Two Souls is the follow up and while I'd love to tell you it's as awesome as Heavy Rain, that's really only half true.  Everything about Beyond Two Souls production values really shines and stands out.  Gameplay wise, it doesn't quite hit as high, however.  There's nothing really &#34;Bad&#34; about Beyond Two Souls, but it's not the best follow up to Heavy Rain.Beyond Two Souls focuses on Jodie.  Ever since she was a girl she's always had a ghost like entity by her side named Aiden.  For the longest time it's hard to decipher just what Beyond Two Souls is about.  The story jumps between Jodie as a child, a teenager and an adult.  But it won't do so in any particular order.  The game jumps from one timeline to another quite often in a very non-linear fashion.  There are times when the story comes off as kind of a mess.  What'll keep you going, however, is how intriguing it all is and the desire to see it all come together.  And it very much does.  The only real strange part about the story being told in this non-linear fashion, is that there's hardly a reason to think it should be.  But even if it were told in order you might still be scratching your head for quite a ways into the game.  Mostly because we're introduced to new characters and plot elements that the story is content to turn its attention away from for extended periods of time before returning to them.  One moment we're with Jodie as a misunderstood teenager.  The next we're with Jodie as a scared child... and then an adult before going back to a part of her past.  Each one introducing something new.  Whether plot related or character related.As I said, it's hard to really say what the story is about.  It's really just about Jodie and Aiden.  Their relationship together and their bond. Everything from a production standpoint about Beyond Two Souls is really up there.  The acting from Ellen Page and Willem Defoe is really good.  Even most of the supporting cast is pretty good.  What might strike you as odd is the writing where there are some pretty poor lines every now and then.  And though the performances by most of the cast is good, there are still moments that stick out as rather bland.  Usually from lesser characters.On the upside, though, the game does look absolutely gorgeous.  The character models are amazing.  Beyond Two Souls is simply one of the best looking games on the PS3 right now.  From time to time the game might freeze up for a second or two or even slow down as a result, but the game is still really easy on the eyes.  But by far the best part has to be the games amazing soundtrack.  One of the best ever composed for a video game.  Simply put, Beyond Two Souls is an assault on the senses.  It's just a good looking, sounding and well crafted game.  Though the story can be confusing it's still good and filled to the brim with a lot of interesting moments and emotional highs.  There aren't many games like it on the market.  It's just a shame the gameplay doesn't stand out quite as much.The gameplay in Beyond Two Souls is most similar to Heavy Rain.  The key difference is that you'll control both Jodie and Aiden throughout the game.  When you control Jodie this is when it's most sensitive to Heavy Rain.  You'll wander through certain locales and perform task.  The game will usually prompt you to do something by pressing certain buttons.  Sometimes it's just a quick tap.  Other times you'll have to hold it.  Sometimes you'll have to hold more than one button at a time.  As you can imagine, sometimes the game will have you do some pretty mundane tasks.  For instance, when getting into conversations you're given choices such as whether to lie or tell the truth or stay silent, but these choices hardly really matter in the long run.  They certainly never really change the outcome of events or the characters reactions.There are also combat scenarios in the game as well.  Jodie will at one point train to fight.  You won't be doing a lot of it in Beyond Two Souls, but the mechanics are quite different from any other game.  When Jodie is performing an action in combat you will use the right analog stick to match some of them.  So if Jodie is punching off to the right, you must move the analog stick right.  If Jodie is kicking downward you must manipulate the analog stick downward.  The only problem with this mechanic is that it's sometimes hard to tell just what Jodie is doing.  It might look like she's punching to the right but it's really just a setup for her to hit someone downward, which means that instead of pressing right on the analog stick... you have to press down.  This actually happens A LOT more often than you'd think.  It doesn't matter, however, as the game is not particularly quick to punish you.Playing as Aiden is a different story.  When playing as Jodie, a quick tap of the triangle button will switch you to Aiden.  As Aiden you can phase through walls and manipulate objects.  You can possess some of your enemies and you can also heal Jodie's wounds or protect her from harm.  Aiden doesn't get quite the same combat experience as Jodie, but it's nice to be able to change from Jodie to Aiden.  Unfortunately you can't do this at all times.  The story pretty much dictates when you can and can't switch to Aiden.  It's not something that can just be done on the fly.There are a few minor complaints about the basic structure of Beyond Two Souls gameplay.  For one, the controls are a little clunky.  Even something so basic as walking can feel clunky.  Particularly when the camera angle changes.  It's easy to make Jodie walk into a wall or become disoriented.  Aiden doesn't control much better as it takes a moment to get a handle on his controls.Some of these problems can be softened if you simply download the Beyond Touch app for your smartphone or tablet.  Doing so allows you to sync your tablet or smart phone to the game and control it that way.  Though many a gamer will probably wonder why this is even an option when the controller itself works fine.  In particular, the app is especially helpful when controlling Aiden.  Along with this there is also a multiplayer feature in the game.  One player controls Jodie while the other controls Aiden.The only real downside to the gameplay in and of itself, is that Beyond Two Souls tries to do what Heavy Rain does in many regards in a story that doesn't quite allow for it.  Heavy Rain was big on making your choices matter.  Doing certain things and performing certain actions (or failing to perform them) resulted in some pretty serious consequences for the player.  The story never ended, but characters could die or events could really play out differently.  Beyond Two Souls tries this, but because of how the story is told it couldn't possibly hope for the same results.  In Beyond Two Souls your choices feel rather mundane in the long run.  They often don't mean anything.  When given choices the outcome rarely (if ever) changes based on one of them.  And if it does change, it never really impacts the overall story.This is compounded by how the story is told.  Obviously if you play through a moment with Jodie as an adult and it flashes back to her being a teenager you know that the end result of whatever it is you're doing isn't going to change.  The choices you make and the moments when you can make them are never impactful enough that they'll alter the story (despite David Cage often saying they would).  It's good at making you feel like your choices are important, but they never really make a difference in how moments of the story itself play out.  For instance, in one moment at a birthday party you're given the option to get even with the kids that bullied you there or just leave.  No matter which choice you make it doesn't impact the story.  It doesn't add to Jodie's character... or even help develop her.  It's great that the preceding scenes before it show that Jodie is different and an outcast... but giving us the choice between revenge or not never really plays a role in the game itself.  What you do here doesn't help develop or impact Jodie as an adult and it obviously can't impact Jodie as a child.  The game is full of moments like this.  Choices that are seemingly big but don't really impact the big picture as a whole.  This might be less bothersome if David Cage hadn't spent so much time telling us that they would.The greater sin is when this happens in gameplay.  David Cage, the games writer and director, has been quite fond of saying he's no fan of game over screens.  That the story must go on no matter what.  And in a game like Heavy Rain this is fine.  You're jumping between different characters in what is a pretty linear story.  But Beyond Two Souls isn't like that.  Since there's no such thing as a game over and the story must go on no matter what, the player feels few consequences for anything they do.  Because of how the story jumps around in the timeline there's not really much room for the game to really let you die.  Obviously if you played through a segment as an adult, you wouldn't be able to die as a teenager.  This doesn't stop you from getting in mortal danger where you'll have to make button presses to save yourself or have Aiden save you.  The problem is that because of the structure your success or failure simply doesn't matter.  In one moment I had to out run pursuers on a train.  One of the things that happens in this scene is that you can make Jodie jump over an obstacle in the way or not.  But it doesn't matter whether you jump over it or trip.  She still keeps going either way.  Tripping over it or jumping doesn't actually matter.  You must then fight them off.  Even if you miss every button press nothing really happens.  You'll get captured and have to escape your captive and jump off the train.  If you manage to fight them off?  You still jump from the train.  How you get to point B is different, sure, but the fact that it has absolutely no impact ON Point B itself is kind of strange.  Other times refusing to do a button input simply makes the game stop and all you do is watch Jodie struggle until you do what the game is actually asking you to do.  No consequences for inaction.  No incentive to hurry up (even in so called crucial moments).  You're given choices, but in a game that's so heavily ABOUT choices it's kind of strange that the impact of them isn't there.There are other moments that are a lot worse, however.  In some instances even missing every button press and just watching the scene changed absolutely nothing.  Some of them played out the same way.  In others the game just sits there waiting for your input.  But at no point in time did I ever feel as though making a mistake would ever result in consequences for me as a player.  What's the point of putting button inputs there if nothing changes?  It sort of makes the idea of Beyond Two Souls having difficulty settings laughable.  Needless to say, any player might as well jump right into the highest difficulty setting immediately.  More than that, it sometimes comes across like the game is putting this out there so that you can feel like you're playing a game without actually playing.  Certainly some scenes can feel a little different, but the story will always press on regardless.  And because of how its told there isn't really much room to put consequences on the player.  If you come to a moment where it seems like Jodie should die from your inaction or doing nothing?  The game simply makes you switch to Aiden to heal her.This is actually rather sad because Beyond Two Souls has some really intense moments.  Moments that, had the player felt more like a participant, might have come across as a lot more breath taking.  And believe me when I say... Beyond Two Souls has some really incredible moments.  Some that really hit emotional highs.  But it's hard to feel the impact when you realize that had you done nothing in them the end result wouldn't have changed.  Basically what I'm saying is... even in gameplay, Beyond Two Souls has a hard time making it feel like your choices matter.  I want to know that me NOT making a kick connect might result in some heavy consequences.  Again, in Heavy Rain this wasn't a problem because it felt like the choices you made mattered.  But the story and approach to that particular game allowed for that flexibility in the story telling.  Beyond Two Souls has no such flexibility.  It's not as though the game really has room to let Jodie die if there's still a moment on the timeline we're working up to.The story of Beyond Two Souls will have you engulfed and perplexed.  It's a good story.  One with a lot of emotional moments and a lot of effective moments.  In terms of reaching for emotional heights, Beyond Two Souls succeeds where few games really have before.  On the other hand, from a gameplay perspective Beyond Two Souls is no where near as exciting.  The player's actions making little difference in the outcome of events or the refusal to make players own up to their mistakes in gameplay is a little jarring at times.  It doesn't keep you from playing the game, but it does give off this idea that the player is merely a passive participant rather than an active one.It is definitely a game worth playing.  Even multiple times.  However, if you are a gamer that values the illusion of choice (or at least the feeling that the choices and mistakes you make in gameplay matter) then you have to get used to the fact that Beyond Two Souls will provide you with a lot of choices, but few that will make a difference or result in consequences for the player.  Beyond Two Souls is a good game, but had it had a couple of tweaks to its gameplay it would've been a great one.",3,Fantastic Production Values and Storytelling Make Up For the Shortcomings in Gameplay,2013/10/24 0:00
A2IGEPJJYKMOWK,B0050SX7BQ,UziHorowitz,89,71,"David Cage and the fine folk at Quantic Dream have become known for creating unique and different games (and yes, they're games), however some people tend to love them and other people find it their mission in life to hate them. Whichever side of the fence you're on, it's undeniable that they offer something different from the status quo, and variety's never a bad thing, especially when it's this good.Beyond, much like Quantic Dream's past games Indigo Prophecy and Heavy Rain, is a very cinematic game that marries both cinematics and gameplay so that the two aren't disjointed but interwoven. While you often have free control of the character, this isn't merely a quick-time event game like some claim, however they are an important aspect to the game. But I'm fine that this isn't a game like most games where you see an amazing cutscene that builds up the characters and shows the more mundane, perhaps emotional, moments in a character's life, while the actual gameplay sections interspersed between the cutscenes have you shooting guns and whatnot. Quantic Dream games have the player doing exciting things but also more mundane things that build the characters and makes you care for them since you're an active participant.As for the graphics, they're the best this generation. There are a few texture oddities and whatnot, but it's overall the most impressive game I've seen this generation. The character models and animations are absolutely best in class. Some of the subtle animations of the characters make them feel like real human beings and not merely video game characters. Ellen Page and everyone else involved gave great performances.Beyond: Two Souls is an emotional journey where you get to truly experience the roller coaster ride and not just watch it play out.

But yes playing the full game obviously is the only way you can get the full story of course. I had a lot of store credit so I decided to use it towards this game since nothing really interesting IMO is coming out anytime soon. Heavy Rain was a breath of fresh air if you like interacting with an animated movie. This game is much the same. You do get some"" and I do mean very little chance to roam around without having quick time actions involved. Does this get old? Well yes and no. The controls are what I would call, using the word wonky. When you first starts especially with fighting, training and dodging it can be a real headache. Shake the controller, which doesn't always respond. Hit x and move the control stick (though which one?) during a slow motion sequence. I think you get the point. Heavy rain seemed much more refined and less hectic in it's controlled movements.Graphically this game is far superior than about any game I've ever seen on PS3, and even some that i've seen on a high end gaming rig. That says a lot for PS3 and the question do we really need a PS4, with games like this? So basically you run through this girls life interacting with people trying to find out different aspects of the question why? Which I won't get into spoilers etc. Lets just say a lot of it is very engrossing, some of it is just annoying. When you move as the entity Aiden if you ""literally"" get motion sickness then you definitely want to steer clear of this game. Moving through walls, cars, people, and about everything you can while floating through the air while fun, is also very very sloppy. When you have to hold L1 and L2, hit buttons to make things move/or possess people it's not full proof. And sometimes very tedious. One example is when knocking over a vehicle it will pin point where/what you need to hit with a blue dot. It took about 10 minutes for me to finally get it in the right spot to flip it. Frankly because when I would try it just did not work. The same with many other scenes that come at you 100mph and you have to react. If you get it wrong you don't die, the story continues, but that may not have been the action you wanted. Sound more like a pain in the rear than a fun game? Well yes it's mostly true. Also I will mention the acting is superb, also with Willem Defoe as the creepy doctor he's very good.But there is something endearing about going on the journey, and frankly more engrossing about it than Heavy Rain. I walked away from the game only to have it on my mind a few hours later. So I give it points for that. But overall I still prefer games like Drakes Fortune, The Last Of Us, Killzone, among other PS3 titles. This is a breath of fresh air for those who want a movie based game (to interact with) more so than a controllable game with just cut scene interactions. So don't buy this unless that's your cup of tea. It's not for everyone. Much like games for the wii people seem to sometimes/most times, want to just sit back take the controller and play. So remember before you drop 60$ on it. Am I sorry I did, well yes and no, I played the demo, so I wanted to continue and find out more. Much like the trailer from an interesting looking film. But it's no loss for me. It is what it is, and it's something new rather than the same ole FPS games. Which are getting older and older fast.In summation, fun yet tedious, exciting yet exhausting, can literally cause you to be sick (don't play if you have seizures or severe motion sickness issues). You be the judge, I'm just a partial jury. Thanks.""",3,An Honest Review An Acquired Taste,2013/10/8 0:00
A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B0050SXKU4,"Christopher Barrett Evil Corgi""""",0,0,"I won't get into details or even into the politics surrounding this game. Merely I will compare this to the previous couple of GTA games and list the improvements for those familiar with the series.+ Vehicle control is VASTLY improved over GTA4.  Not quite as 'fake' feeling as the super stable control of GTA SA and GTA VC though.  Which is also a plus.  Cars can lose control, but it doesn't feel like you're playing Mario Kart nor does it feel bouncy like you're playing Stunt Race FX (remember that one???)+ Improved story and characters.  Basically you have three characters with different personalities.  It's kind of a blend of previous GTA archetypes and personalities.  You have the young guy trying to make his way in the criminal underworld, you have the deranged nut job, and you have the ex-con with a family who is bored with life and decides to get back in the game.  Their stories cross and it makes for one of the more enjoyable main mission story lines in the GTA series.+ Improved missions.  I say this because you have mission checkpointing.  If you fail a mission you can continue at the last checkpoint (which means you won't have to do over those tedious parts if that applies to a particular mission - in other words, if you spend 20 minutes carefully setting bombs, then have to evade the cops afterwards, you won't restart the mission if you get caught by the cops, you would just restart at the checkpoint after you detonated the bombs).  You also have the option to cancel the mission.+ Character and vehicle graphics are improved.  Not a huge item of contention for most folks since GTA IV looked really good.  But the character models are better quality and they are much better articulated.  You actually have them moving like real people and even their fingers move independently.  Facial expressions are much improved as well.  People have more than the basic emotions - their eyes follow others and they react realistically.  Cars also have more pop.  The lines are cleaner and there is much more detail to the vehicles.  Many you can actually tell what car or combination of cars they resemble in real life.  It's always fun trying to outrun cops in the car based on a Prius!+ Banter!  This one I really enjoy.  Previous games have included a bit, but this is really the first game where the characters truly interact while on missions.  And it's not conversation that MUST be heard to advance the game, instead it's a little commentary that adds fun.  It also depends on what actions you the player take.  For example, when Michael's son gets in the car he changes the station to rap.  If you then change the station or turn off the radio he whines and calls Michael an a-hole.+ Huge open world.  And I mean HUGE!  It's similar to GTA SA - well, because it's based on Los Angeles.  There are many familiar landmarks and buildings.  The city has a similar shape, size, and layout - though there is much less sprawl.  But it feels very similar to being in the real deal.  Once you leave the main Los Santos area, the world is not as similar to the real thing.  The outlying areas are not just empty swaths.  There is a lot to do out and about in the hinterlands.  Rampages, dirtbike and ATV races, even a few extra missions.+ Virtually no catastrophic bugs.  There are the regular little glitches and bugs.  But I haven't had any of the Skyrim style bugs that force you to shut down and restart the game.  Mostly just getting stuck somewhere (which isn't too bad as long as you can self grenade).  But I never got stuck anywhere I couldn't get out of.  There are a few interesting little graphical effects, such as people crashing cars in odd ways... but you can't really complain about these things.  The game is insanely detailed and I can forgive a few glitches that don't cause me to lose hours of game play by forced restarts.  25% through and not a single restart!+ Forthcoming GTA online.  I am looking forward to playing in the GTA world with friends.  And for free!  How sweet of a deal is that?  I'll update after they launch on October 1.So until my next few updates, enjoy!  I know folks will either love or hate this game.  But it's amazing and a vast improvement IMHO on GTA IV.",5,Improved upon the GTV IV formula greatly ~,2013/9/17 0:00
AJIDIVBILJKO0,B0050SXKU4,MekoRush,3,2,"This game wowed me a lot more than GTA4 did when it was released. I felt this game had more things you could do and they wanted it to be known especially with the dog fido, with GTA 4 you was treated with a 10 min intro that got you into your character, after that you're off to do some killing, but in this game they wanted to teach  you for the first hour of the game. from switching characters up to teaching Fido new tricks(your dog). Now the sad thing is to make money you have to hustle. I remember you use to could just kill and kill big mob bosses and get big bucks then purchase a few houses but nope here they want you to invest in stocks(really?) or rob banks.

A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B0050SXKU4,"Richard Baker BinaryMessiah""""",0,0,"The Good: Fantastic story with believable characters, gigantic open world that feels alive, gun play has finally been fixed and feels great, a lot of customization options, amazing attention to detailThe Bad: Huge frame rate issues, graphics are technically very dated, main story feels a tad short, online component isn't shipped with the game, missions can be overly difficult most of the time, cars still control poorlyWell, here it is folks. Probably one of the most anticipated games of all time. It's breaking records everywhere. It has made over $1 billion already, it was the UK's best selling game of all time, the list goes on. Why is such a &#34;real&#34; game like GTA5 so popular? Usually sequels and series are dead at their fifth iteration, so what makes GTA5 so special? Love and care. Rockstar loves their franchise so much, they have put 5 years into GTA5 to make it what it is which is nearly perfect. There is so much freaking detail in this game I could go on forever describing it all. So let's start with the story.You play as three characters this time around which is a first for GTA5. Trevor, Michael, and Franklin are your average joes trying to get rich quick. The game starts out differently than any other GTA. You aren't starting out just outside of a car, this time Rockstar got a little cinematic on us. You're in the middle of a bank heist in a small town. You end up fighting your way out and the story fast forwards 10 years. Right from the start you get introduced to Michael, then Franklin, then Trevor later on. Each character is very well fleshed out and you end up getting attached to all of them in the game. Of course the other half of the great characters are people you get your missions from and this doesn't change here. While there aren't as many characters as past games they are more well designed and original. You end up going through the trials and tribulations of these three men as they get caught up in the mafia, street gangs, the government, and millionaires. Basically Michael is trying to make amends with his family on the side while Trevor is trying to find out what he really wants -- Franklin just wants to get out of the hood.The largest problem with GTA has finally been addressed: the terrible shooting mechanics. GTA IV tried to fix this, but it felt too sticky and too clunky. GTA 5 is finally more refined and feels like a third person shooter should. You can snap into cover, aim with precision, and all that great shooter stuff. You can even change the reticle if you want, honestly GTA 5 gives you more options on a console than any other game I can remember. While we're on combat you can finally customize your guns for the first time in a GTA. Add supressors, scopes, extended mags, flashlights, new paint, etc. It's not Call of Duty deep, but it's a huge step up for GTA. However, the combat is still tough as nails. You will die in a few hits if you aren't careful and I restarted many missions a lot because of how hard the game is.Secondly, the vehicles still control like you're driving on syrup. You will spin out a lot, and easily lose control. At least the cars look updated and are actually knock offs of real cars. The Banshee looks like the Dodge Viper and there's a car in here that's called the Coil. Figure out what that one's based off of. They look good and you can customize these as well! Yes! It's a lot deeper than you think. There are different levels of upgrades and they make a huge difference on how they perform. Some missions even require upgraded cars. Car wise, the game still shines and doesn't disappoint.While we're talking about cars and combat they all tie into missions just like previous games. Honestly, GTA 5 feels so polished and refined and is a perfect GTA game. The missions are a huge step up because you get to choose how they play out this time around. There are large heists that you need to perform and you can pick your accomplices and can choose two different routes to go. They are usually sneaking and going through the front guns blazing. It's a lot of fun and you really feel like you earned your cash in the game. During some missions you can switch between the three characters on the fly for an advantage. This adds a whole new layer to combat in GTA. The missions are much more varied than previous games and are just so much fun, honestly I haven't had this much fun in a sandbox game in a long time. You get rated after each mission and there are side objectives to complete for gold stars.Outside of those story missions are side missions called Strangers and Freaks. You meet weird people that you help out and these characters are both funny and strange. On top of that, you have random encounters where you help people on the fly as you pass them. It really helps bring the world to life. While we're on that subject, GTA 5 is one of the most surreal game worlds ever created. Los Santos is huge and I mean just huge. There are whole mountain ranges, huge areas of the ocean, and San Andreas as well as Los Santos itself to explore. Even the ocean looks so real thanks to the great water physics and under water effects. Scuba diving is a brand new option here, and yes there are under water missions. However, Rockstar took all this to a whole new level when it comes to detail. You can hunt in the mountains, the scenery gradually changes as you move around the world. It's just so awesome it's hard to believe that this is all out of someone's imagination.Your cell phone for example is an expansion to the one in GTA IV. You can buy stocks and bonds online, buy vehicles to get delivered to your garage, buy boats, planes, and various other things on the phone. You can now order a cab and most messages are done through text and email. It helps bring GTA to the present times and feels that way. The amount of detail in both the characters, world, graphics, and gameplay is just phenomenal. From the turbulence in aircraft to the way boats bounce off waves. GTA 5 has unparalleled detail that is rarely seen in any entertainment medium.At the end of your first day you won't want to put the controller down. With over 100 missions GTA 5 is full of things to do and places to explore. Michael, Trevor, and Franklin are great characters and everyone will have their favorites. Despite the ultra violence, cursing, and nudity in the game GTA 5 is gritty and raw and should be. Rockstar is one of the only came companies who have the guts to show everyone their vision without being afraid of political backlash. I'm sure GTA 5 will have plenty of that (thankfully Jack Thompson will be absent for this one). GTA 5 is one of the best games I have played in a long time and I can't find much wrong with it. Honestly, it's just typical stuff like frame rate slow down, some ugly textures, the online component was missing at launch, a few bugs and glitches here and there, but other than that the game is almost perfect.",5,Best GTA game to date with a fantastic story and characters,2014/4/9 0:00

A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B0050SXKU4,Winter,2,1,"With every successive entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, there's always an attempt to bring something a bit new to the table.  While GTA V does have new features, it's really hard to pick any one thing that stands out head and shoulders above the rest:  there's just so much here!  The world is massive.  Like Skyrim, you can go just about anywhere, even out swimming in the ocean to that small strand of islands, or up over the top of a hill that in other games would eventually run you into a bounding box.  It's simply amazing how big Rockstar has been able to make the sandbox.  The graphics are astounding, and on the PS3, I feel like I'm watching Sony's dearly-paid-for hardware finally giving you its all.  Sunlight, ocean waves, the physics of fire and water...even the camera-shake of being too close to an explosion seem just about right.Then there's the people.  There is a ton of recorded dialogue in the game, from some top-notch voice talent.  Even random conversations overheard are fairly well fleshed out, if short.  Even though it's not perfect yet, people still behave a lot more normally than I expected this time around:  they'll argue or fight with each other, get in wrecks, or just have a lot of road rage that they're eager to share.  Events unfold in the GTA world of Los Santos, CA and it seems like it doesn't matter whether you're there or not.  There are small random bits, like witnessing a pickpocket, where you have the opportunity to do something.  There are slightly bigger events, where you might meet a new contact just because you happened to be in the right place at the right time.  And then we have the fact that this world is no longer a single-character experience:  in GTA V, you can switch to other characters fairly much at will.  In a mission, you might switch to another team member (even your dog!).  Outside the mission, the main story of the game introduces you to multiple characters, and you can advance the story for each as you please.  An interesting touch is that when you're not 'moving' the other characters, they're probably going on about their lives, and so as you jump into one, they could be doing anything.If there are any barriers in GTA V, it's the proverbial Fourth Wall"", and Rockstar North is knocking furiously to break it down.  In-game, there is a stock market, and you can use your money to buy and sell--and tip the scales with your actions!  Out of game, there is a downloadable app (""iFruit"" - available for iPhone, coming any day now for Android) that will let you manage your characters a bit.  It has a mini-game you can use to train your dog, and lets you view screenshots, including your own.  ""Screenshots"" is a clever example of the game-reality interaction:  when you're in-game, the way you take a screen shot is to bring up your phone, choose the camera, and take a picture.  If you have a Rockstar Social Club account (required for iFruit), you can connect with your friends.Gameplay for GTA V is slightly improved, but can take some getting used to.  The aiming mechanisms in GTA IV were very difficult for me, so I like the new 'snap-to-target' behavior of the right stick when in aiming mode.  However, the reticle is a tiny white dot that can be hard to track, and there are times you pull hard enough on the stick that it snaps to the target and bounces onwards before you can stop.  The driving interface is still awkward, but now we have a nice bonus from the San Andreas days:  with everything you do, it gets better.  Go practice at the gun range ($14, unlimited ammo, many weapons supplied for you).  Drive around in different vehicles.  Run, sprint, and swim.  Your skills will get better, and things really do get noticeably easier.There have been a couple of bugs for me, but not major ones--I've had my main car duplicate itself and I've heard that some people have lost vehicles between saves.If you're already a fan of the series and you're on the fence about buying GTA V at its opening price point, I highly recommend taking the plunge.  Prepare to lose your time, but also expect to see a lot of hard work in this title, showcasing about as good as gaming gets.  If you're new to the GTA series, there is a LOT to take in here, but I feel like the game still does a good job of gradually getting you there, feeding you bits of features as they go.  It should be said that this game is rated 'M' for Mature, and that's a hard 'M':  I've been exposed to a lot of games, movies, music, etc. over the years and GTA V has been one of those experiences that at times can be hard to take.Either way, Grand Theft Auto V is not to be missed.  I am not surprised it has already sold over a billion dollars.""",5,Beautiful Deviance,2013/9/27 0:00
A1ZPVW0WXNJ3YZ,B0050SYX8W,"Alex 47""""",76,51,"It's here. It's finally here. After what I thought was a disappointment in Bungie's final Halo game, Halo: Reach, 343 Industries has taken the helm for a new trilogy. Halo 4 takes place after Halo 3, which was released over 5 years ago now. How is this game different?As far as multiplayer (That will be the highlight of my review, sorry for the campaign fans), 343 has implemented a lot of things from Call of Duty. Don't let that scare you though if that idea doesn't sound good to you -- it works flawlessly in Halo 4. While the perks seem to run the multiplayer in Call of Duty, what truly should be the difference -- the gun -- is what truly matters in Halo 4. Unlike Call of Duty, there doesn't seem to be any overpowered perk"" in this game. Some of the guns seem to be excessively powerful, but they all have downfalls. Whether that downfall is a small clip or something else, 343 makes sure nothing in the game is gamebreaking, which is impressive. Something that should also be noted is that everybody in multiplayer now has the ability to sprint for a limited time, which makes the gameplay faster paced and more frantic. That inclusion, unsurprisingly, only makes this game better.The maps in the multiplayer mostly range from good to fantastic, with not even one map that I would say I truly dislike. The maps here have a vast variety from small to large in size, and snowy to grassy. My personal favorite has to be Exile, which is a fairly big map that makes for hectic Capture the Flag matches, and it just looks and plays phenomenally.If you enjoyed Firefight from Reach, I'm sorry to say it's not returning. Instead though, 343 has included Spartan Ops. In this free mode, content will be released weekly with several episodes for you and your friends to play in. While the missions are fairly entertaining, I'm not quite sure what the purpose of them is, mainly because they seem to end before you even start going.As for the campaign, I won't spoil a thing, but I will tell you that this is probably the best campaign yet in the series. The voice acting is better than ever, the humans' facial reactions are spot on, and there are -- thankfully -- very few parts in it that aren't fun. I can also tell you that this is one of the hardest campaigns I've played in a shooter... at least on its highest difficulty setting, Legendary.I tried to keep this review relatively short. There is a lot to say about this game and its contents, but I wouldn't be able to do the game justice. Rather than have you waste 20 minutes reading this review, I'd rather give you that time to go out and get the game if you haven't already.Halo 4 won't exactly change the genre, but it has taken the essences of Halo 3 and the good portions of Halo: Reach (Did I mention there's no Armor Lock in this game?), and made one of the best online gaming experiences for this generation. It could well be the closest thing you'll find to Xbox LIVE multiplayer gaming nirvana.5/5""",5,Game of the Year,2012/11/6 0:00

ADPEAVHFCNLLC,B0050SYX8W,Poisoned Blade,2,1,"Wow, normally when a different developer takes over a AAA Franchise (or any franchise) you could end up with a disaster.  This is not the case with Halo 4.Concept:  10/10Create another Halo game with more focus on the Master Chief and Cortana and add a new Alien Race complete with an arsenal of new weapon types.  They pulled this off beautifully.  Add a ton of Multiplayer Modes, too.Story:  9/10For the first time we get a real look at the background of the Master Chief.  If you're a die hard Halo fan, you already know that the government kidnapped children and raised / engineered them as supersoldiers.  These people have no conscience and are sociopaths.  If you think about it, the Master Chief has killed thousands of enemies and he doesn't lose any sleep over it.  These Spartans are paired up with an AI.  The Master Chief has always had Cortana.  She's guides him through the missions and acts as a link to his humanity.  The story focuses on their relationship as they encounter a new alien threat to the human race.  This is the most human story"" the Halo series has ever had.Graphics:  10/10Halo has never looked better!  The characters are more detailed, there are more FX, and the environments are HUGE, which usually translates to EPIC!Gameplay:  9/10The gameplay is very well paced where you trade off from infantry battles, vehicle battles, air battles, etc.  Many of the encounters give you great weapons AND vehicles and it's up to you to complete it any way you want.  This works exceptionally well with their Co-Op system.  Halo 4 also includes 4 difficulty levels and their Skulls System, which allows you to Turn On specific difficulty features.  For example:  Enemies have more Health, Enemies drop less Ammo, Enemies are more resistant to some damage, and less resistant to others...  There are so many options to play through the campaign.Multiplayer: 10/10It's Halo Multiplayer with everything that you'd expect from the franchise.  You have the campaign options, Spartan Ops, which are missions designed for Co-op Play, and a ton of Competitive Modes.  It's just about everything that you'd want.Replay Value:  10/10With so many ways to play through the Campaign and a variety of Multiplayer Modes, you could play Halo 4 for months.  Play with your friends, play against your enemies, play on different difficulties with skulls turned on to test your skills...Maturity:  TeensThe Halo Franchise is always rated M because when Halo 1 came out, congress was freaking out about sniping in games and head shots.  This is just a sci-fi adventure where you kill aliens with laser guns.  There's no sex or swearing...  There are a few cinematic deaths, but it's no more violent than the stuff on TV.  If this was a movie, it would be PG-13.Overall:  10/10This may be my favorite Halo game.  With a human story, beautiful graphics, smooth gameplay, and epic missions, it's definitely a GREAT addition to the franchise.  This is a must buy for fans of the series or fans of the FPS genre.  If you shop around, you can get it for $39.99, too.Buy it if you love Halo.Buy it if you love FPS games.Buy it if you love Epic Sci-Fi.Buy it if you will play the Multiplayer Modes.Rent it if you just want to blow through the 8 hour campaign and play through the story.Avoid this game if...  umm...

A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B0050SYX8W,"Richard Baker BinaryMessiah""""",0,0,"The Good: Fantastic graphics and sound, tight and balanced gun play, new enemies are fun, lots of fun new weapons, meaty multiplayer suiteThe Bad: Confusing story, campaign is repetitive and unbalanced, feels too similar to other HalosThe Halo series is probably one of the most repetitive and unchanging series I have ever played. The first 3 were pretty good and Reach and ODST made me fall asleep. With Bungie out of the picture and 343 Industries into the captain&#8217;s chair I figured Halo may have some great new changes. I was half right. The single player campaign is pretty fun and is as tough as nails. The new weapons are awesome to shoot and there&#8217;s new enemies for once that are different. The story is convoluted and confusing, but hardcore fans may be able to follow it okay.The mechanics are pretty much the same as previous Halo games. There&#8217;s no iron sights, the game is fast paced with high jumping and fast sprinting. There&#8217;s still no cover system which is a shame and the game is damn hard. I felt the story was a bit random and the environments felt the same way. One minute I&#8217;m shooting the same tired Covenant then these machine type aliens, then mutated Covenant, then regular Covenant. There was some vehicle sections and I was riding a giant vehicle. The game just felt all over the place, but it was fun at least.The story is really confusing and never makes much sense. Something about Cortana being infected and a giant being called the Didact trying to destroy everything. It&#8217;s nothing fancy or sophisticated but you can&#8217;t expect much from an FPS. At least the game just feels tighter and a bit more heavy feeling and less floaty than other Halos. I felt the weapons had weight to them and the sheer variety had me switching them up all the time for different situations. I did find that there were repetitive scenarios through the whole game like jump into stations to hit a button at the top and running back down to get to the next one. This scenario repeated often through the whole game and felt archaic and overly simple.While the structured campaign felt old and tired the multiplayer is still the best part of Halo. The constantly updated match types makes you come back for more all the time. The game feels faster paced and just more fluid and balanced than any previous Halo game. Customization is deep for your avatar, there are many levels to climb, and the unlocks are sweet and rewarding. After you beat the Halo campaign just once I doubt you will ever go back because of how forgettable and repetitive it feels. I honestly think at this point Halo should just continue as a multiplayer only game and maybe jump on board with PC.The few little tweaks here and there help the game just become more balanced overall. The lack of duel wielding makes the game feel more raw and &#8220;hardcore&#8221;, various adjustments in damage from each weapon and the increased damage for melee attacks is nice. I also love how great the game looks. This is the best looking Xbox 360 game out and the voice acting and animations are so life like. However, the Xbox 360 doesn&#8217;t have the processing power as the PS3 so you won&#8217;t see The Last of Us quality textures and lighting effects. There are some ugly textures in Halo 4 and it really showed some times. Surprisingly there wasn&#8217;t any slow down or glitches that plagued other Halo games.Overall, Halo 4 is a great final opus for the 360 but isn&#8217;t the revolutionary new Halo like everyone thought. The campaign is repetitive, extremely difficult, and confusing, the story is so-so, but the multiplayer is where the meat of the game is at.",4,"Not what I expected from a new studio, but still entertaining",2014/4/9 0:00

A2IGEPJJYKMOWK,B0050SYX8W,UziHorowitz,2,1,"*This is a single player reviewHalo 4 is by all accounts an exceptional game. 343 Industries first internally developed Halo game impresses on pretty much every front. From high quality production values, to a buttery smooth framerate 99.999% of the time, to the best graphics the series has ever seen, to a more interesting story between Chief and Cortana, etc. Halo 4 is Halo at its best.Firstly, Halo 4 plays like a dream. Similar to previous Halo's, gun combat is very satisfying, but now it's more visceral and impactful than ever before. If anyone says this is Call of Duty, that's hogwash. Other than the inclusion of sprinting, this very much feels like Halo, just improved and more polished than ever. The action is much more buttery smooth than Reach was, which makes playing a complete pleasure.Secondly, the graphics are a massive upgrade from previous Halo's. Previous Halo's lacked quite a bit when it came to character models and animations, but Halo 4 has some of the best looking character models and animations in all of gaming. It's shocking just how much of a leap these two things are from the Halo's that came before it. Going from Halo 3 to Halo 4 shows almost a full generational leap in things like lighting, character models, and animations. In addition, Halo 4 runs in native 720p resolution, which is a first for the Halo franchise, as Halo 3, ODST, and Reach all ran at upscaled 720p. To get that full native 720p resolution, Halo 4 is locked at 30 frames-per-second, and it's a wise choice. Unlike Reach, which had a framerate that varied wildly at times, Halo 4 is pretty much consistent and performs beautifully, even when under pressure from a lot of on-screen action. 343 Industries should be commended for such a technological feat as their first project. It's very impressive.Thirdly, the story's actually incredibly compelling. While some things aren't always crystal clear, it's mostly smooth and cohesive the majority of the time. The relationship between Master Chief and Cortana will hook you from the beginning of the game and until you reach the credits at the finale. Halo 4 is a tightly knit production that offers excellence in story, visual quality, and sound quality. It's truly a masterful game from a first time studio.As someone who has enjoyed the other Halo games this generation, I didn't fall in love with them, so it's shocking to me that Halo 4 has hit the nail on the head in pretty much everything it set out to do. Halo 4 is the best Halo since Halo: Combat Evolved. 343 Industries has made their mark on the industry, so I truly can't wait to see what they do next.",5,The Most Polished & Impressive Halo to Date,2012/11/7 0:00
A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B0053BCP40,"Christopher Barrett Evil Corgi""""",3,2,"I won't get too involved in the review since it will probably be buried in the middle of the 350+ already posted.  I mainly wanted to point out a few pros and cons about this game.  It might seem I'm nitpicking, but I must state that it is a very enjoyable game, and a worthy addition to the 3DS library.My negative points?  Well, for starters, the game has a level type system.  What this means is that you only access each part of the mansion in each 'level'.  Subsequent levels do have access to broader parts of the mansion, though with slightly different bad guys and puzzles.  But I felt the game would have been a bit more solid with a more traditional adventure approach.  Granted, having the 'levels' means you can challenge yourself to get higher scores each time you replay the level, but then again, a 100% completion style challenge would have been acceptable.Second, controls are a bit wonky.  Luigi moves rather slowly, even when running, so it's a bit of a chore sometimes to get to places.  Hand in hand with the control is the button assignments.  They are a bit confusing, and several buttons have multiple functions, so you often find yourself just tapping one button for one thing and then having it reassign due to some other influence, such as the location of a place to 'check'.  Minor, but occasionally annoying.Pros?  Well the challenge is very good.  The game starts you on training wheels and then about halfway through you really notice the difficulty is higher.  You will probably see game over a few times.  Puzzles aren't too tricky, but they can be a bit challenging at times.  Often there is some little object which is overlooked, a crack in the wall or a rug or curtain hiding a key item.There isn't much story, but there is a bit of comedic interaction between Luigi, the ghosts and the Doctor.  My only beef with the story is that Luigi comes off as kind of a wuss.  But it's still funny.So in my opinion, it's a very good game, though with limited replay.  The graphics are impressive for the system.  I didn't use the 3D very much, but it was very good the few times I had it active.  Bottom line?  There are better games for 3DS and games I think 3DS owners should consider first.  But for those looking for a good follow up to the Gamecube sleeper hit, this is a very good sequel.",4,Solid follow up we've been yearning for ~,2013/11/5 0:00
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B0053BCP40,"Michael Kerner Michael Kerner""""",25,16,"When it has came down to Luigi, he has only been known as one thing, Mario's sidekick when it comes down to fighting Bowser and rescuing Princess Toadstool away from the clutches of evil. But Luigi has once in awhile been known to have a escapade away from Mario. That showed a decade ago with Luigi's Mansion, the launch game for the Nintendo Gamecube back in 2001. The game was underrated but had maintained a steady cult following. But it has been a longtime since there has been a follow-up to the classic game. There was never a sequel to the game for the Nintendo Wii, instead the return comes to the Nintendo 3DS with Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon. The question is for Luigi fans, is the game worth while. Well, it is a haunting yes and a fearful scare from Luigi himself.Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon does deliver what fans of the original Nintendo Gamecube game wanted in a game. This time around Professor E-Gad is seeking help from Luigi as he is trying to study friendly ghosts during a eventful moon. But sadly, the moon and the ghosts get possessed by the devilish King Boo who takes control of the harvesting Dark Moon and Luigi gets to return on a ghost hunting spree. This time around Luigi has to use his puzzle solving skills and quests through 5 different mansions hunting different ghosts from traditional boos to ghosts spooks and dog ghosts. There are some new features as well like a multiplayer challenge called Scarescaper where you and your friends can go on a ghostbusting spree, and try to escape first to the bottom of the tower. Graphically, the game does stand up very well to the Gamecube original, and the sound and control of the game measure up nicely. Sadly though, there could have been more for the multiplayer action to draw more people in. There could've been a multiplayer in the main adventure to measure up to the game, like Luigi's past games with Mario. Still, it does measure up to the challenge for any single player action.All in all, despite a few flaws Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon is definitely worth playing from beginning to end. I have always found the original game to be challenging but fun to master. This time around, it definitely is up to the fun, especially for anyone that wants to scare up to the task. If you have played the Nintendo Gamecube game, you'll definitely be up to this scary good game. But for those who have never played the original game, might be uncomfortable with the ghost hunt. For them, I recommend you play the original Nintendo Gamecube title first, and see if you are up to the game. But for those that want to have a second haunt from King Boo, this would be one worth trying.Graphics: B 1/2+Sound: BControl: BFun & Enjoyment: B 1/2+ for single player; C+ for multiplayerOverall: B 1/2-",4,Ghostbuster,2013/3/24 0:00

The 3DS seems like a perfect home for the sequel so Nintendo went for it. You play as Luigi who is tasked with dispersing a small town of ghosts with the help of Professor E. Gadd. You take your Poltergust 5000 and suck and blow anything in your path. Be it cloth on walls, rugs, pulleys, or using your other powers to reveal hidden objects or even your flashlight to help battle ghosts. There&#8217;s quite a few elements in play here and they are done fairly well. Ghosts don&#8217;t just stand around and let you suck them up. Some are protected by objects or are inside other objects and require coaxing out in various ways. This with the inclusion of puzzles makes Luigi&#8217;s Mansion a fun trip.It isn&#8217;t without its problems and there are more than meets the eye like most recent Nintendo games. Sure the game looks great and plays well but it gets repetitive half-way through and gets frustrating. You&#8217;d expect tougher ghosts to come into play at some point, but instead you get the same ghosts with bigger life bars and more thrown at you. As you progress you find cash throughout the game to upgrade your equipment so this isn&#8217;t a problem. I was nearly maxed out towards the end of the game. The issue is redundancy and constantly revisiting the same areas just to fight different ghosts. Some puzzles are hard to figure out and some require insistent backtracking that gets very dull. The game had the Mario charm thrown in, but I expected more variety. After the third area you really start getting tired of the game, but that doesn&#8217;t mean its terrible.There are some hidden items in each area and they aren&#8217;t too hard to find if you explore every little area. These range from gems to cash to a hidden Boo in each level. It feels less like a collectathon and more like exploring an area. The objectives are clear and your map is useful. With that said, many objectives are also repeated throughout like chasing down a ghost dog to find a key and getting back parts from various ghosts. It just got old and I just kept telling myself, &#8220;Not this again!&#8221;Dark Moon is one of the best looking 3DS games out there. The game has high-resolution textures, great looking models, and some impressive lighting effects and physics. I almost felt like I was playing the Wii U. The 3D effects are nice, but don&#8217;t add anything to the gameplay. I loved the attention to detail from Luigi&#8217;s voice to his animations.

A2IGEPJJYKMOWK,B0053BCP40,UziHorowitz,3,2,"Luigi's Mansion for the Gamecube was a wonderfully charming and fun game on the Gamecube, but many years would pass without even a peep from Nintendo about a sequel to it. Luigi's Mansion was the best Ghostbusters game ever made, which is mighty praise since it's not even a Ghostbusters licensed game, but it's exactly what you'd expect an excellent Ghostbusters game to be. So it was a shame that the Luigi's Mansion IP dropped off of the radar after the first game. Then the 3DS came out and fans would finally have their dreams fulfilled in the form of Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon. Seeing as the first Luigi's Mansion released over a decade ago, can a sequel to that game be relevant in 2013 and still offer enough fresh things? The answer to that is a resounding yes.Luigi's Mansion's gameplay is very similar to the original, but it still offers enough new in terms of some additions to the gameplay mechanics and such. Since we're talking about a portable game, Next Level Games made Dark Moon a much more portable friendly game, offering a lot of exploration while segmenting each mission into nice bite-sized chunks. The main mechanic of finding ghosts and sucking them up into the Poltergust is a lot of fun, but it doesn't get old since you'll come in contact with various ghosts that require a little bit of thinking and strategy. In addition to the lengthy and very replayable single player campaign, there's multiplayer options that lengthen the game's replay value, which are very addictive and well-built.The graphics in Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon are some of the best on 3DS, right up there with titles like Super Mario 3D Land, Resident Evil: Revelations, Kid Icarus: Uprising, etc. Each mansion is beautifully detailed and littered with so many little touches that truly bring the environments to life. All of the environments have a ton of interactivity. This game's gorgeous graphics look even better in 3D.Next Level Games nailed it with Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon. I couldn't recommend this game more. This game not only lives up to the original but surpasses it in many ways. Next Level games has made excellent games (Punch-Out Wii, Captain America: Super Soldier 360/PS3), but this is their best work to date.",5,The Crowning Jewel of the 3DS Library,2013/3/28 0:00
A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B007CM0K86,,0,0,"The Good: Fantastic visuals, gripping story, Joel and Ellie are memorable characters, lots of fun guns to use, crafting on the fly, Clickers are down right scaryThe Bad: Poor sense of direction, combat is down right hard at times, combat sequences are all the same, feels repetitive towards the end, some glitches and AI issuesPost-apocalyptic games always try to focus on a mass group of people or the devastation itself. The Last of Us focuses on two people, Joel and Ellie as they travel across the US to find a cure for the biological outbreak that&#8217;s destroyed the planet. The journey is a decent length and you really get to love Joel and Ellie and they become amazing characters that you don&#8217;t want to separate from.The Last of Us is full of emotion and amazing production values. It&#8217;s the best looking game to grace the PS3 and is a great entry for the final lap of the console&#8217;s life cycle. The combat is a mix of action and stealth. You can sneak around enemies and grab them from behind and either shiv them or strangle them. Shivs aren&#8217;t easy to come by, you must craft them and they can break. Strangling takes about 10 seconds to do and is a slow way to kill someone, make sure no one else is around or you will spotted. You don&#8217;t just fight humans in this game, Clickers are some of the scariest monsters since Dead Space&#8217;s Necromorphs. The sounds that were used are incredibly scary and original. These creepy creatures can hear you even if you crouch. You must slowly crouch around them and you can only kill them with shivs. Hunters and Runners are also hard to fight but Runners can&#8217;t be snuck up on, you must fight them. Bloaters are like Tanks from Left 4 Dead; huge enemies that are hard to take down. These enemies are interesting to fight, but they are the only ones in the game so it can get repetitive after a while.Repetition sets in in other things like each encounter feeling the exact same way. It&#8217;s just room after room of zombies or humans to fight. I wanted more cinematic events which were kind of sparse. Crafting and collecting parts helps make the game a bit more interesting. You can craft melee weapons, molotovs, shivs, medkits, and smoke bombs. You can craft in the middle of combat which is nice, but weapon upgrade stations are rare. There are only about a dozen in the whole game and you need to save up a lot of your parts to upgrade weapons. You can add gun slots and even increase clip capacity on one shot weapons which is nice. There&#8217;s actually a good variety of weapons and they all feel useful in different situations. I found myself using all of them one way or another often.The game is very linear but feels like an adventure. You go through various areas in the US from Boston to Utah and the game just oozes stylized atmosphere. You really feel like you&#8217;re being pulled into this destroyed world and it just feels so compelling. Despite combat though there isn&#8217;t much to the game, there&#8217;s no puzzles or anything else that&#8217;s very challenging. Just pushing Ellie across pallets in water, moving ladders etc. The combat is down right frustrating since Clickers can kill you in one hit and the stealth is a bit iffy. Some times it felt the AI was flawed and got me killed. I also ran into a few glitches.The story itself is the best part about the game. Bringing Ellie across the country and the hardships these two go through is just something else. I don&#8217;t want to spoil anything, but you get to play as both characters and Ellie is just a strong character. A little girl who curses, kills people, and wipes out an entire gang on her own? It&#8217;s nothing like I have ever seen and shows Naughty Dog has guts to do this.The game itself looks amazing. The textures are at such a high-resolution, the animations and models look great, and the lighting is fantastic. It really shows just how much more powerful the PS3 is over the Xbox 360. 360 exclusives like Gears of War 3 and Halo 4 have some pretty ugly textures and the lighting doesn&#8217;t look too hot. The Last of Us looks like a PC game and is blew my mind which is rare for current generation consoles these days. There are a few eyes sores but you really have to hunt for them, if only every developer put this much effort into their games.Overall, The Last of Us is one of the best games of this generation and the best PS3 game this year. Joel and Ellie are highly memorable characters and their journey is frightening and enlightening. The combat can feel repetitive towards the end and can be down right difficult and frustrating, not to mention constantly being lost due to a lack of direction. Despite these flaws this is one fantastic journey that every PS3 gamer should endure.",5,"Not just the best looking game of this generation of consoles, but one of the best PS3 has to offer",2014/4/9 0:00
AJIDIVBILJKO0,B007CM0K86,,1,0,"This would be drakes father if they was related. Both games created from same developers . Ok last of us does venture off into a great story and I would say its totally diff from uncharted.  Like other than the developers making the game they have nothin in common so it's good these guys didnt still anything from the other....Good: great story, tons of actions, gore!, overall gameplay when it comes to upgrading weapons and just how you go about killing enemies in diff ways.Bad: you will prob die over and over at certain parts of the game depending on how you like to kill. Run and gun type of players will find it frustrating as there are times when 7 monsters are coming at you and you have to take 8 seconds to reload smh and you're dead after that. Then stealth guys will find it frustrating you cant stealth kill some zombies. Like most gsmes these days the computer buddy that suppose to help you kill enemies only shoot about 3 rounds and take cover for about 20 seconds then shoot 3 more. So if you go in charging they will stand behind waiting until you clear a path.Conclusion: great for your action adventure guys but call of duty players(online) will prob get tired of replaying the levels quickly after seeing the run n gun doesn't work well on this game.",4,Drake's(uncharted) father gets his own game,2013/8/30 0:00
AFV2584U13XP3,B007CM0K86,,28,18,"Naughty Dog has done another great game with this survival post apocalyptic world that has neither zombies or aliens as the main enemies but other humans trying to survive this new harsh reality.The game feels like a true survival story gameplay where almost everything has to be ration carefully from food to first aid. Also the game isn't only a third person shooter,that's not the point but more on using your environment and the tools and equipment to help you along your mission. The characters are also very well thought out and done in the story as you learn their history and not only the main characters but other characters along the way that both hinder and help you. The environmental effects and background are incredible in the game and the A.I. is pretty decent too, meaning when you try and distract an enemy with a bottle or something it won't just dumbly follow the noise but keep looking around so you can't just assume the enemy is going to the noise and won't pay attention to anything else.The character voice cast picked for this did a terrific job in their character roles bringing incredible believability in the game making you almost feel like it's happening to these characters for real, also the personal history you see and learn later on really helps you connect to them especially the tragedy that befell Joel and the reason for his now harsher outlook on life and his almost apathetic nature to what's happening with the world.Ellie is also understandable in her personality and while she sometimes seems naive you can also see she understands the nature of what's going on and has a more understanding of the actions needed to survive then you might suspect from a young teenager.The game also allows you to upgrade a little like the new Tomb Raider from weapons to first aid equipment and also like with Uncharted you can fight if needed unarmed so you're not helpless if you have no ammo though you are at a disadvantage.So for those looking for another great game from Naughty Dog here it is and trust me you'll get your dose of action/drama/tragdedy/humor(Not much) that will have you playing this game for hours without noticing how much time has passed.",5,Great Apocalyptic And One Of The Few That Doesn't Rely On Aliens Or The Walking Dead,2013/6/14 0:00

They were good quality games that were not just great in cinematic quality, but also in interactive quality.  Beautifully bending the interactive touch of a video game with the cinematic trappings of a good adventure film.  Sure there were moments when it was over-the-top and surreal, but they were good fun and delivered interesting characters and stories.  The Last of Us strives to aim a lot higher than Uncharted, however. Instead of being an outright adventure, The Last of Us reaches a lot higher, is bolder and may be the best thing Naughty Dog has ever put out as a developer thus far.You play as Joel, a man who survived the end of the world.  Twenty years after a parasitic fungus turned the world into a wasteland, Joel and few other humans are out for survival.  And The Last of Us never lets you forget your goal is to survive.  Joel and his ally Tess spend a lot of time trading goods with survivors outside of the city to make a living and to survive.  Soon Joel is tasked with smuggling a teenage girl named Ellie to a band only known as The Fireflies.  Joel agrees and thus the adventure of The Last of Us truly begins.  The story is great, but only because the characters within it are great.  The Last of Us makes no bones about what it is.  It's a game that takes place in a dreary future where there is only one rule: To survive.  You don't know if you can trust the people you meet.  As the game is quick to point out that everyone is out to serve their own ends.  Small factions have formed among humans, but more than that, Joel and his allies (and enemies) must beware the infected who are also lurking around.The story may be a bit slow, but it wastes no time trying to really develop characters.  Like Uncharted many of the best moments are when the characters are simply having casual conversation amongst one another.  Unlike Uncharted, though, the tone is a lot more bleak.  It's a world that's been ravaged and ransacked and it shows.  There is still humor from time to time, but the game never lets you forget just how the world is.  The interactions between Joel and Ellie in particular are quite moving and telling of who they are.  It's very hard not to care about them and their struggles.  And The Last of Us has no issue pulling on your heart strings.  It sets the tone and press forward unapologetically.The Last of Us is a pretty big game in and of itself.  By comparison, the Uncharted games are a pretty linear affair.  You'll never get lost or never know where to go in those games.  The Last of Us isn't exactly non-linear, but there's a greater emphasis on exploring your environment for supplies, ammo and health.  You'll rarely be confused on where to go or what to do, but if you're not taking the time to properly explore your locale you may that The Last of Us can be a challenging experience nonetheless.  This is primarily because combat can (and often does) demand a lot of the player.  Survival is the name of the game and The Last of Us keeps this in mind.  Ammo is scarce a lot of the time.  Just because it seems like you're finding a lot, doesn't mean it can't all be depleted in the next encounter.  It's not unusual to use up entire ammo supplies in one encounter and be left to nothing but your supplies and fists in another.  If you aren't willing to balance some of it out, The Last of Us can be challenging.The good news is that checkpoints are quite frequent throughout the experience.  Should the worst befall you in any given situation you usually don't start too far from where it all happened.  This often times means that you can try other strategies without too much worry.Exploring the environments is much more important than the game itself is willing to let on.  While not every nook and cranny is actually crawling with infected or bad guys, you still need to search.  This is especially true because The Last of Us is very serious about it's survival instincts.  You'll find parts that can be used to create support weapons or items to heal you, but never both.  You also can't load up on stocks and constantly save them as the game only allows you to carry around a very limited quantity.  And everything the game wants you to do is done in real time.  You CAN pause the game, but none of your crafting or looking at artifacts you may find in this world or using health packs can be done from a pause menu.  Instead it's all done in real time, which puts a greater emphasis on finding safety when you can.  You'll have to craft while enemies could be bearing down on your or still be within the area.  You'll have to apply a health pack under the same circumstances.  This means in the midst of a firefight this is probably going to be difficult to do.  But when you have down time you'll relish the chance to prepare yourself for what may be lurking around the next corner.  This also means that when you can, you'll be more than tempted to explore each and every environment around you.The combat is often smooth and keeps you on your toes.  Many instances can feel overwhemling.  This is especially true if you are very reckless with your supplies and find yourself lacking them for the next encounter.  Enemies often rush you with reckless abandon.  There is time to think and react, but no doubt you'll bite the bullet more than enough times on your first play through.  Luckily the game gives you means by which to change or deepen the experience.  When crouching, Joel can increase his sense of hearing and plan accordingly.  You can often get an idea of where enemies this way.  Likewise, if enemies haven't noticed you, you can go for stealth kills or (if you're really bold) try to sneak by entirely.  The game encourages you to experiment, letting you know there isn't always a right way to go about anything.  Don't expect your downed enemies to be riddled with extra supplies, however.  They rarely (if ever) drop anything.  Again, there's a neat little dynamic about The Last of Us as a result of all of this.  Very few players will experience the game in the same way twice.  The way you utilize your supplies often results in different play styles and experiences.  Some players will find themselves forced into melee combat, while others will choose to do so in fear that they might not actually find supplies later.  And sure enough, no matter how much you comb over some environments, it's actually quite easy to miss items.If there's one thing that can almost always be said about Naughty Dog, it's that they certainly know how to make a good looking game.  The environments in The Last of Us look absolutely amazing.  The world has a pulse and comes to life like so few video game worlds do.  You'll find graffiti on walls that you can read, wanted poster, remnants of an old civilization are everywhere.  Ransacked homes, broken televisions, destroyed buildings.  The Last of Us is unapologetic about it's style and what it strives to convey.  Nothing showcases this better than the environments in which the game takes place in.  The world doesn't just look like a typical post apocalyptic world.  It actually looks like someone's living in it too.  In particular watching the prologue and then watching as it shifts showcases how much care and attention was actually put into each environments.  But perhaps the best part about The Last of Us, is that the atmosphere rarely drops.  The feeling of dread is surrounding the player much of the time.  Not just because of how it all looks, but because of how it also plays.  This idea that you might not have enough ammo for the next encounter.  There will be moments in which the player may be feeling anxious or even unprepared for certain situations as a result.  The end result is that you get a game where survival really is the root of it all as opposed to a game that often asks the player to run in guns blazing.  You CAN do this in The Last of Us if you so choose to, but it's quite clear there is something discouraging about doing so.The production values are good on another level as well.  The voice acting and sound are all phenomenal.  The sound effects are startlingly real.  The most rewarding part, however, is easily the soundtrack, which sounds nothing short of fantastic.  Often times it sets the mood perfectly, as well as provides a certain amount of comfort, dread and loneliness that some of the characters most certainly feel.  It's a well crafted and beautiful soundtrack overall.The Last of Us was a game that had high expectations upon it's announcement.  Not just coming out after Naughty Dog's success with Uncharted, but also at the onset of a new generation of consoles.  It delivers on multiple fronts.  If anything The Last of Us can feel a little sluggish at times.  This is especially true in the beginning when the game is teaching you how to play it and show you the ropes.  The Last of Us will take its sweet little time setting the stage for what is to unfold, and for some gamers it will undoubtedly test their patience.  Stick with it, however and the game comes to a point where it simply keeps getting bigger and better.Simply put, The Last of Us is a pretty bold game.  It's more than just another run of the mill shooter.  It's attention to detail and character make it a gaming experience worth having.  If you have a PS3 it is definitely worth a look.",5,Unlike Anything I've Experienced Before,2013/6/15 0:00
A114TMHW9GRMPB,B007CM0K86,PM_SuperFreak,5,4,"I wasn't planning to buy this game at first, and having just finished Tomb Raider, which I thoroughly enjoyed, I was unsure if this game could stand up to the numerous positive reviews posted. I decided to give it a try, and was simply amazed! The ending was really surprisingly emotional and thought-provoking, which stands out from 99% of the games in the market today in my opinion.The visuals, the plot, the gun play, the level design, are all fantastically done, and the sheer variety of situations was just plain awesome. I must rate this as one of the best games I've played in the past several years. The closest description would be Uncharted + Tomb Raider with heavy emphasis on stealth.

This is the Playstation 3's premier title, surpassing even the excellent Uncharted and Infamous games. It's rare that gamers are treated to a game of this caliber, but Naughty Dog has delivered a genre-defining experience that will make you demand more from game developers in the future. Consider The Last of Us to be the new standard.The Last of Us hits a homerun on presentation. Bringing excellent voice acting, animations, soundtrack, environmental detail, and a whole lot of care into every other facet of the game's presentation, Naughty Dog has shown that they're one of the finest developers in the gaming industry.The gameplay is mostly a mix of stealth and action, which is a nice change of pace from Uncharted. The Last of Us is all about survival, and you'll have to try your damnedest to stay alive in some of the intense scenarios this game throws at you.The Last of Us is a journey that ends in a satisfying way. You don't get some poorly done cliffhanger ending here, but a quality narrative from beginning to end, constantly getting even better with the more time you put into it. The Last of Us is a game of all highs and no lows; there's no filler here whatsoever.The Last of Us deserves every bit of praise it has received.",5,The Best Exclusive This Console Generation,2013/6/20 0:00

Dent Aragorn""""",0,0,"The mission: you must make friends, gather allies and stop the murders and the killer in this mystery-based and twist-filled story.Definitely the best Vita game so far. Persona 4 Golden is a JRPG with a good story line, lovable characters, and an addictive dungeon crawler.You play as a new transfer student who moves to a small town just before a killer starts murdering people. You discover you have the ability to enter TVs into a world filled with monsters, and that you can to call on your own monsters, aka Persona. Your Persona gets more powerful by forging bonds and relationships with the people in your new town.A slandered play through is probably about 60 hours. The dungeon crawler part will probably take up about a quarter of this time. You wander through the 8 rather large dungeons (plus a smaller one that could be counted as a ninth), opening chest for supplies  and fighting the monsters known as shadows. You do this for money, items and to get new Persona. The other way to get a new Persona is to fuse a few tougher  The battles are turn by turn but there are other elements to account for like building a good team, paying attention to the different weakness of the shadows and the occasional support you may get from the allies not currently in the party.When you are not dungeon crawling, you are in town. You need to boost stats like courage and intelligence to make and strengthen the bonds you make with people. This is the true experience in this game. The characters are voiced and dialogued  The voice acting is some of the best I've ever heard, but some also sounds a little phoned in. You must do all of this within a year of the game's calendar  which is when the main character leaves the town. You must also make a decision on how to spend your days and nights that are not guided by plot. This is one of the game's weakness  Since it is so big, and you have a limited amount of time to complete the game, you may often get the feeling that you are missing something.These characters and plots will make you laugh and cry because of the awesome voice acting.The graphics and gameplay will give away that this used to be a ps2 game but there are a few features made especially for the Vita. There is a new menu where you can listen to the music from the game, replay one of the fully animated cut scenes, learn about the psychology references in the game, watch old Persona series trailers, look at game art and play a quiz game. In game, there is also a feature witch lets you see what other people did if you need a suggestion on how to spend your day in the game.New players may have a little trouble getting started. Even though the tutorial is very long, it is not as specific and helpful as it should be, but by reading the manual and looking up tips online new players should be fine.Persona 4 is a triumph in the Vita's currently smallish game selection.

A1TY4TRLA4QK5Y,B007W8S2MG,"Brian Long Brian""""",1,1,"Persona 4 is one of those few games that defies easy pigeon holing: its part murder mystery, part personal drama, teen high-school romance, and a hack-n-slash RPG with micromanaging resource side games.You play the traditional silent protagonist, living with your uncle in a remote town, when murders start to occur, tied to a mystery world within TV's that reveals peoples darkest secrets and natures.First off, the cast is wonderful and almost fully voiced, and not a single character is one-dimensional. Characters are deep and felshed out over the course of multi-layered interactions where you grow to connect with them and help them overcome their personal strifes.The gameplay is simple and straightforwd, and once a healthy level is reached, you could feasibly grind through the randomized dungeons ad nauseum. Nestled into this is a Pokemon like hunt for the Personas, reflections of your personality based on mythological and religious figures that you can cycle through to adopt various powers and strengths, or pick the one you like and buff them up to maximum level, swapping and growing skills with a nice roulette style bonus system for winning fights in a strategic manner.But the combat is completely overshadowed by the complex web of personal development, dating games, and other side quests that challenge you to figure out how to best utilize your time: who do you spend time with and help hone their skills, or do you work at a job to get enough cash for new gear, or do you study and try to ace your midterms and impress all of your friends at once.And thats just within the game. Fans will love the TV olerlay which brings in a little quiz show about the setup, and references and movies from the previous games of the Persona series, all of which are amusing and at least worth a few extra points.While this is a rerelease of a title from the mid 2000's, it's been polished to a high mirror shine. A few nits are still present, but they are so few and far between as to be unmentionable.The difficulty curve is a little harsh to begin with, especially if you play on a higher difficulty, and the random chance of a TPK from a lucky enemy power is still possible, but apart from that increasingly rare occurance as you level and improve, this game is easily worth the 60-70 hours you can dump into even a single playthrough, all of it worth the effort and even the few tears this game can ellicit.",5,"Wonderful story wrapped in a simple, fun package",2012/12/12 0:00

I've been playing this intensely for about 2 weeks and even though the combat mechanics are confusing and repetitive (and remind me of everything I hate about RPG), the storyline itself is fascinating enough to keep me going. You play as a high school student whom you name yourself and, together with up to 7 other playable characters, try to solve a series of murders. The story takes place from April 2011 to March 2012 but all but a tiny part of the story is done by Christmas 2011. Like all good RPGs you get different endings depending on the choices you make. You spend a lot of time passing the days doing chores or earning money or talking to friends.

A1ZPVW0WXNJ3YZ,B007XVTR3K,,86,54,"Black Ops 2 has arrived. Just over two years since one of my favorite Call of Duty titles was released, Treyarch is back at it with the sequel. Rather than taking place in the 1960's though, this game hikes to 2025 and takes you on a ride. Here's my review. Not to worry, there won't be any spoilers... although there will be heavy emphasis on multiplayer.I won't tell you about the story of Black Ops 2, but I will tell you how this Call of Duty is different from those previous. Rather than going from A to B to sometimes C, Treyarch makes this game less linear this time around. You have options of what you want to do/where you want to go, and they even affect the mission in minor ways. Your decisions won't completely change the story, but they're a wise addition that should have been added at least a couple years ago. This inclusion makes you feel like YOU'RE playing the game, rather than making you feel like the game is playing YOU. Without ruining the campaign for all of you, I can tell you that this is a game that's single player you will definitely want to go through ... especially if you played the original Black Ops.Zombies. Well, I have to admit -- don't hurt me -- I wasn't a big fan of Zombies in Black Ops because I felt like the first handful of rounds was a complete waste of time and dragged on needlessly. This time around though, there's actually a STORY to Zombies ... imagine that. While I'm still not high on the game mode, I like it a heck of a lot more than I did in the last game, and I can guarantee that those that loved Zombies before will only enjoy it more. Don't think that's possible? Wait until you play the game. Also, for you stat addicts, Zombie stats will be tracked on Call of Duty ELiTE.And the thing most people buy Call of Duty for ... the multiplayer. There are countless things to say about this. You'll have anti-CoD people tell you that this is the same game as last year. And the year before. And the year before that. Well, that's frankly not true. Black Ops 2 innovates almost as much as Call of Duty 4 originally did. Like the first Modern Warfare, Black Ops 2 may change the series forever. The whole Pick Ten system in this game is an ingenious idea that will seriously make you think when making classes if you want to compete. If you find that you don't ever use your secondary, add a fourth perk. If you don't throw grenades, add another attachment to your gun. The ability to customize your experience in this way will make you hungry for more unlocks and experimentation.Treyarch doesn't stop there, though. Black Ops 2 has now introduced a brand new thing called League Play. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newbie to the series, you'll be able to form a clan and face other clans with a similar skill level, thanks to Treyarch's skill-based matchmaking. If competing in heated clan wars isn't your thing, you can of course still hop into a random public match.Also added to Black Ops 2 is what many people are calling CoD Casting"" mode. With this, you can view live streams (or previously recorded versions) of matches. This is going to be a useful feature to many ... especially those that are looking to learn techniques that the more seasoned Call of Duty players use.Treyarch has done with Black Ops 2 what many people have long begged them to do: Change the series up. A lot of fans and critics felt that Call of Duty was releasing nothing but $60 map packs every year... I have to say, Black Ops 2 ought to shut those people up. From the ability to make personal choices in campaign, to the better-than-ever Zombies mode, to the most balanced multiplayer experience Call of Duty has probably ever had, there's something here for anybody to love. Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 may very well be the best game in the series.4.75/5+: ""Personalized"" campaign; Zombies; Pick 10 system in multiplayer; Awesome weapon/perk/grenade/equipment balance online.-: This game is nearly flawless and has added a lot of innovation, but I'm beginning to feel some FPS burnout; Multiplayer maps don't feel as great as I thought the Black Ops 1 maps did.""",5,"Great.

ADPEAVHFCNLLC,B007XVTR3K,,10,6,"So there are a ton of 5 Star Best Game Ever"" Reviews and a ton of 1 Star ""Trash"" Reviews.  I'll try to explain why someone would like this game.Concept:  9/10Take Black Ops, set it 13 years in the future, add spy tech and drones, streamline Multi-Player, and Add More Zombies.  It's a good idea and it's a ton of entertainment for $60.  Especially if you play on X-Box Live.Gameplay:  8/10Call of Duty has been Activision's Annual Cash Cow and they're not about to scrap their formula and start from scratch if they're making $500,000,000 on opening day.  It's designed to make the average Joe feel like a Hero in half hour increments.  The game is basically a very high production shooting gallery with assisted aiming.  You run to very clearly marked checkpoints, killing bad guys along the way.  The game's aiming system will make everyone feel like a Commando as they run through Missions that rival the most insane action sequences Hollywood has to offer.There's no training mission or anything.  You just get thrown right into a battle with your allies yelling at you to go faster, run here, and kill that guy!  GO GO GO!  This is Call of Duty!  There ain't no time for training!  It's an FPS, RTS, Tank Driving, Air Combat, Horseback Riding, Run and Gun, Sniping Game, with Zombies!  The downside is that the Player never really gets properly trained on how to play and they can't make decisions for themselves.  Because of this, they are 100% reliant on HUD information:  Objective is 112M away.  FOLLOW this guy.  There were a few times where I found myself tuning out all of the great over-the-top action sequences as I just sprinted to the next checkpoint.  If I strayed too far away from the path or accidentally killed an ally, I was insta-failed and had to play the checkpoint over again.  There were a few ""Ok, what do you want me to do?""  Missions, that broke immersion.Black Ops 2 features some new additions.  You can modify your starting equipment, guns, attachments, and grenades, and replay levels to get a ""High Score"" that shows up on Leaderboards.  During the Campaign, you make some very obvious choices that will affect the game's ending.  There are 4 main endings which really pay off the decisions that you made.There are also 4 Optional Levels that Play like an RTS.  You can coordinate your troops from a satellite view and jump in and control them manually if you want.  At first, this was a bit confusing, but if you learn the controls, it's fun.  But it is pretty difficult to multi-task.  Not everyone is going to like this feature, which is why these missions are optional.Story:  5/10The game flashes back to Missions that took place in the 1980's, then flashes forward to 2025.  You play most of the levels as members of the US Special Forces.  The story is narrated and held together by a crippled veteran who's been through hell.  The main villain, Menendez, runs a massive terrorist organization and he's got a plan for world revolution and you follow his rise to power.  You even play a few levels as Menendez (and he seems more powerful than Wolverine.)  I really tried to get into the story, but it felt like a B-Action Movie without the obligatory forced romance.  It was over-acted and under-acted at the same time, and reminded me of the plot of Team America World Police... but it wasn't supposed to be a comedy.  If you like testosterone, action, and meaningful choices, then you may like the story.  If you manage to take the story seriously, then you will enjoy the multiple endings.Multi-Player:  8/10The changes aren't going to make everyone happy.10 Point System.  When equipping your character classes, you get 10 points to spend on items.  Perks cost 1, guns cost 1, upgrades cost 1, grenades cost 1...  And you decide how you spend your 10 points.  You get 5 customizable character classes and you can arm them for every type of scenario.  Close range, Defense, Assault, Sniping, Objectives...  It's simple and it's great.When You go up a level, you get a Token.  This is used to unlock a new Perk, Gun Attachment, Weapon, or Kill Streak Item.  This is also simple and great.The Guns are a mixed bag.  Some people will like this, others, not so much.  At the low levels, it takes a while to kill your target.  Maybe 5 hits.  So, even if you get hit, Tak-Tak, you can still run for cover and make it.  As you go up in level, the guns become a lot more deadly and you die fast.  The guns also have a laser site, which helps you shoot accurately from the hip, so you don't have to waste a second to look through your sights.  To counter this, the higher level sights all have a special abilities.  Some allow you to see stationary enemies through walls, so you can ambush the campers.  Others highlight enemy targets across the map, so you can pick out the snipers before they get you.  So, you'll need to decide if you want to run and gun or stalk your enemies.Kill Streaks are a bit tougher to get and they're on a point system.  You get 100 points for an enemy Kill and 25-50 points for an Assist.  The Steaks cost 400-1000 points and there are some incredibly powerful ones, but as you can imagine, they are really hard to get.There are a few main problems with Multiplayer:Many times, you spawn right near an enemy and you die before you can even turn your head.  This is no fun.  On the flip side, the game doesn't really penalize you for deaths (Unless you are in Deathmatch) and the base career stats only count your kills and wins.  So, if dying, respawning, and dying in 2 seconds makes you mad, you will hate this.  But you respawn again almost instantly, so it's really not too bad.Lag Compensation:  Think of it as Latency Socialism.  If you have a super fast connection and you're fighting against an enemy with a slow connection, the game helps out the slower player.  You may shoot first and as your bullets hit - Tak-Tak-Tak...  and they fire back, it seems as if they kill you in 1 hit because the 5 of their bullets hit you all at once.  Tak-Dead.  There is also a bit of weirdness if you try to run around a corner for cover.  On the Final Kill Cam which shows the replay of the last death of the match, many times you see an enemy take cover and the bullets go right through a steel wall and finish him off.The Lobby...  Many Players complain about not being able to get into a game quickly.  I never had any problem with this.  I'm sure Activision will have this fixed over time.  The game just sold 10 million copies in its first week and trying to match 350k Players at one time from all over the country is no easy task.Zombies:  7/10There are also changes to Zombies.  More Modes, More Maps, but they're small, and Objective Based Gameplay.  There's enough content here where ""Zombies"" can almost be a stand-alone game.  Play alone or Play with friends!Sound:  9/10The sound is top notch and puts you right into the action.  Gunfire, Explosions, Swearing...  It's all there and it's loud.  Some of the background music choices are questionable, though.Maturity:  MThis is a gory game full of graphic war violence and a ton of foul language.  But when I play online, everyone with a microphone sounds like a pip-squeak and they swear when I kill them.  So, this game is suited for older teens and fans of R-Rated Action Movies, but a lot of the audience is in the 3rd grade.Replay Value:  10/10There's a 7 hour Campaign with multiple endings, leaderboards, different weaponry, and difficulty levels.  There's Multi-Player with a ton of different modes and unlocks that will take you months.  Then there's zombies, which can be enjoyed both single Player and Online.  For the price of a tank of gas, there's 100+ hours of content here.  Even if you only like 1 or 2 of the Game Modes, it's worth the Price.Overall:  8/10This is a very good game with a ton of content for $60.  Is it perfect?  Nope.  Is it going to make all 10 million gamers happy?  Nope.  But if you're looking for another Call of Duty Game with Multi-Player and Zombies, then you should enjoy this one.  There are some positive steps in the right direction and this is the most ambitious Call of Duty Game to date.""",4,You'll Enjoy This Game If...,2012/11/20 0:00

A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B007XVTR3K,Winter,0,0,"For the most part I have really been enjoying Black Ops II, but it should be said that I'm not currently doing the Multiplayer portion, and if you're someone who's buying this game solely for that you should probably read the many Multiplayer-centric reviews here because there have been some serious issues with the game.  For me I'm enjoying the Single Player Campaign and looking forward to seeing how far I can climb in the now-ubiquitous Zombies portion.  I've played every game in the Call of Duty series and with luck will continue to enjoy them.The original Call of Duty:  Black Ops took place during the Vietnam War. Black Ops II takes the story from the original Black Ops and carries it forward in more ways than one:  the story is told through flashbacks that carry you through missions at the tail end of the Vietnam War, then into the late '80s as the Cold War started to end, and also in our near future, a 2025 that is very real and believable because technology we have or are about to have is integrated into the gameplay.  While you don't have to know much about the events of the first game to understand the story, it does help to do so and I enjoy the way they take the storyline forward.Graphically, Black Ops II is only a bit cleaner than Black Ops, but that's not much of a criticism given that the first Black Ops game looks really good on the XBox 360.  There is a smoothness to the play that seems to make it easier to move through, though at times the way the camera takes over to create a more 'cinematic' moment can be off-putting--such as when you tumble down a hillside or get caught by surprise to forward the storyline.  Fewer of these moments actually require you to do anything, so they're more spectacle than they are quicktime event.Gameplay of Black Ops II is fun and intricate because of some additions.  You can customize the loadout you take into a level.  There are 'Strike Force' missions that put you in more of a tactical position:  you play the objective flipping between a map-level view where you give orders to your allies, and diving directly into a soldier or device.  The interesting part is that Strike Force missions give you a certain number of 'teams' to try the mission and your success or failure drives the Single-Player Campaign.  This means that you story can go different ways with different playthroughs.Unfortunately, there are some problems that leave me feeling the same way I did in World at War, when I seemed to perpetually die pointlessly at random choke-points and have to do something stupid to get out of it.  Some of the markers you need to go past to progress the mission actually require you to physically tag them for no reason.  I had a level where I was doing a great job helping my team advance by flanking up one side and going around, but the hotspot was in the dead center of a clearing covered in enemy crossfire.  There was no reason for me to go there, such as an object to pick up or a switch to flip, etc.; but until I ran out in that clearing and tagged that dot, we couldn't go forward and enemies just kept spawning.  There is a mission where I'm supposed to avoid a drone and nothing I did seemed to work until I ignored my squad leader's orders, hid in a corner, and waited for him to get to the checkpoint before me.  I'm smart enough to move quietly and hide in shadows by now--this was one of those moments when I wondered how they could possibly have playtested that piece.  Shortly after that, I'm instructed to go prone...and the 'go prone' button simplly doesn't work...unless I stand in a specific spot.  Despite there being no obstacles or 'can't go prone here' warning, it doesn't fit the perfect happy path of the designers.These combined with some AI stupidity in the Strike Force missions are the drawbacks to the game.

A2TCG2HV1VJP6V,B0088MVPFQ,Ryan Sil. (Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...,1,1,"Gosh...I feel like I jinxed Nintendo with mySuper Mario 3D Landreview. I stated that every time Nintendo makes a Mario game, it turns out to bepure gold(no pun intended). New Super Mario Bros 2 is a sequel to the2006 smash hit that revived classic Mario action on the DS. However, I can't tolerate the fact that it doesn't offer new music, graphics, or even different environments anymore. New Super Mario Bros Wii differed from NSMB enough to be worthy of a sequel. NSMB2 isn't.New Super Mario Bros 2, like I just said, lifts the same environments, graphics, and music fromNew Super Mario Bros. Wii. That said, the territory sure is rather familiar, considering the fact that I've seen these same grasslands, deserts, icelands, and lava areas for three games in a row in the same series. The objects are also mostly the same. We've got the average enemies (Now with skeletal Piranha Plants???), the average obstacles, and the average Red Coin Ring.Although the lack of originality is astounding, the level design is still brilliant (for the most part), and that alone is why I gave the game 3 stars. The classic Super Mario gameplay is intact and plays as well as ever. If you don't consider the coin-collecting Goomba-stomping platforming fun to be a winning formula, then you are just plain heartless. And although the Racoon Leaf, the Mega Mushroom, and Reznor boss fights are techincally rehashes, their inclusions in NSMB2 are welcome.But now comes another problem with the game: The coin-grubbing gimmick it promotes. I know, I know. Everyone loves collecting coins in the Mario games, but Nintendo took this WAY too far. Coins are EVERYWHERE you go, and there are even new power-ups specifically designed to give Wario a run for his money! A block that Mario wears on his head spews coins as he runs, a new type of Fire Flower turns crap into coins, and there's also a power that gives the enemies a golden makeover.You'd think this would make for an awesome new premise if done correctly. Unfortunately, it WASN'T done correctly. Apparently this time around, Nintendo didn't look too much into the fact that collecting 100 coins rewards you with a 1up. So guess what? You'll end up getting hundreds of extra lives BEFORE YOU EVEN KNOW IT. It's nice to see that there's a Coin Rush mode for going on a rampage for coins, but why the heck is it like this for the actual game?! Why couldn't the coin opportunities be ONLY for Coin Rush mode? So basically, the game becomes a lot easier, and the challenge depletes.But wait...How could the challenge go away? You'll never know what kind of challenge the levels could offer, right? Well, the levels certainly are fun and challenging, but the loads of opportunities with the coin-collecting affect the overall difficulty. No level could be a total bother because you have a lot of lives to spare. You could just simply learn the level by trial-and-error to get through.BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. If you die a lot of times on a level, you'll be offered a White Racoon Leaf, which basically gives you invincibility for the rest of your time in the level. I tolerated this in Super Mario 3D Land, but in a game that's already easy, this is BULL. The challenge is totally ruined! Players could just lazily romp through the levels this way. They have a million lives left, so you could just beat all of the main 6 Worlds this way.Overall, this is classic Mario made unnecessarily easy and unoriginal. If you want to buy a Mario game for on-the-go play on 3DS, get yourself Super Mario 3D Land or, for a less expensive title, the first New Super Mario Bros! Both games are much better in every way, really. As much as I hate having to bash on the game series I love the most, New Super Mario Bros 2 is only worth playing for the new levels and/or if you're not that great at Mario at all.",3,What...happened here?,2012/12/8 0:00
A36UKFV79879MD,B0088MVPFQ,BX Lounger,1,1,"New Super Mario Bros. was a monster hit for the Nintendo DS. It breathed new life in the legendary platform series not seen since Super Mario World for the SNES. Ir basically took the gameplay mechanics of the NES titles and modernized it for today's current video gaming generation. After seeing the hugely successful New Super Mario Bros Wii perform so well on the Wii, Nintendo wisely decided to release the sequel to the DS hit for the 3DS. While it's still just as fun and challenging as the DS title, it kind of feels like you've been there before (just like deja vu.)The story is just like any Mario game you've seen before: the princess gets kidnapped...yeah yeah yeah. Bowser returns as the main bad guy and his Koopa kids (from Super Mario Bros. 3) are back to help spread the mischief. 6 worlds plus 4 alternate worlds AND a secret world await you. You can choose to play the game on your own or include a friend to help you tackle the stages together. Also, the game gives you three save files in case your friends want their own file. Nintendo introduced new elements for this game. First, the main theme is to go grab as many coins as you can; the game now keeps record of how many coins you collect on every stage. Because of the new coin theme, there's a new power up to use: the gold flower. Use it to collect even more coins and turn almost anything into coins. Second, there's another power up (White Raccoon tail) that makes you invincible in case you are having trouble getting through a particular stage. Third, you can unlock Luigi at some point in the game and use him to clear the stages. Finally, there's a new mode called Coin Rush"". Here, you can play through stages from the game where you must collect as many coins as possible before the timer runs out and complete it. You can save your records and exchange them with other players who have the game through the SpotPass feature; doing so lets you challenge other players' records to see if you can beat their score. Nintendo went a step further and released extra Coin Rush stages that you can purchase and download online to your 3DS.The PROS: Leave it to Nintendo to keep a good thing going. The stages are fun, clever and interesting. They also get challenging as you get further into the game. The graphics and sounds are top notch. The music is pleasant and controlling Mario (and Luigi) is as easy as if it ever was. There is plenty of incentive to collect everything and find every secret as this is how you can get to the alternate worlds as well as finding the secret world. Unlocking Luigi is crucial since you need him to get the lucrative 5 star rating (you get rated on how well you perform in the game.) The Coin Rush mode is an interesting feature as it gets players to complete and unload their records online so that they can receive and challenge other players' records from around the world; it also helps to increase your overall coin total. If you get 1,000,000 coins, the title screen changes (and there's a small bonus for collecting 3,000,000 coins.) For those of you who want a challenge, you will find it here as it's no walk in the park once you get past the first world.The CONS: There's one glaring flaw with NSMB2......you get the feeling that you've done this before. Sure, it's still fun to play but Nintendo could have put more twists and added more variety to the game. Most of what you see in this game looks familiar and that's a problem in the long run. Also, the first game on the DS had a lot more stages compared to what you see here. The same goes for the music; while it's good, most of it was lifted from New Super Mario Bros. so don't expect to hear new background music.While New Super Mario Bros. 2 is fun and challenging, Nintendo could have added more stages with more variety. They also dropped the ball by using most of the same background music that you heard from the first game. Thankfully, the Coin Rush mode throws in a twist to the tried and true Mario game and adds life to it long after you beat the main story mode (collecting coins becomes a little addicting.) It's still worth getting whether you pick up a physical copy or download it online and straight to your 3DS through the eShop. I recommend it.""",4,4 stars..with a deja vu feeling,2013/7/31 0:00
A2IGEPJJYKMOWK,B0088MVPFQ,,5,1,"I know, I shouldn't let Nintendo milk me for what I'm worth -- which, by the way, isn't a whole lot -- but even a Mario game that hardly pushes any aspect is still a Mario game, thus you have what is arguably the best platforming mechanics you'll find in any game. Mario is associated with quality and New Super Mario Bros. 2 is no different. Does it do anything new? Not really. But what it does do, it does particularly well. Pay no mind to the reviews saying this game deserves 1 star. In no way, shape, or form is this a 1 star game. Even though it's more of the same, quite frankly, it's still a very polished and good playing Mario game. You don't have to excuse Nintendo for its resistance to change, but at least give an honest summation of the game and leave out the hyperbolist drivel.There's not a whole lot to say about New Super Mario Bros. 2 since it's exactly what one would expect from a 2D Mario game. It offers the grassy world, the desert world, etc., while having you collect coins, which brings me to this game's one slight difference from previous Mario's. New Super Mario Bros. 2 puts a very heavy emphasis on coin collecting. On the back of the box it says, Can you collect a million coins"", and it means it. Tracking your overall coin total, adding it to a global total of coins collected worldwide, your duty is to get as much gold as possible, which isn't a difficult task given how much you can collect in any given level. For example, I had well over 3,000 coins in under 20 minutes of play, so it's entirely possible to get to a million by playing the entire game, replaying levels, etc.Whether you like the old school Mario ingredients or not, it's irrefutable that this game has the ingredients it takes to make a fun Mario game. Unless you're one who's hell-bent on innovation and can't enjoy the classic plumber's latest platforming adventure, I'd say to jump right in and get to the coin collecting.""",4,More of the same isn't so bad when it's Mario,2012/8/24 0:00
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B0088MVPFQ,,32,19,"There is no question that when it has came down to the Super Mario Brothers games, they have definitely delivered every single time. Since 1985 when the original Super Mario Brothers debuted, gamers have gone wild for Mario & Luigi unlike any other game in the arcades and at home with the original NES. But with so many games and systems going and trying to do what Nintendo had done, Nintendo hadn't lost its edge. With the Nintendo 3DS, they delivered brilliantly last year with Super Mario 3D Land and reinvented the way Mario took the platform run and jump game brilliantly into 3D. The game definitely showed what Mario was made of like he every time was from start to finish. But through the game, we also saw a few elements that were taken on from Super Mario Brothers 3. Well that is shown again for the Nintendo 3DS. But is New Super Mario Brothers 2 worth the money? Absolutely.New Super Mario Brothers 2, continues the winning formula that made New Super Mario Brothers Wii and the original New Super Mario Brothers showed from the original Nintendo DS well, as Mario is back at it again, trying to rescue Princess Toadstool from the clutches of Bowser. This time, he isn't the one alone again. He has his kids, the Koopa Kids Lemmy, Ludwig, Morton, Wendy, Iggy, Larry and Roy with him. They are holding her in the wake of a massive coin crop where there are going to be more coins for Mario to grasp. But with it, the game shows a bigger challenge with new levels of excitement for Mario to explore, and classic enemies again like Renzor from Super Mario World and Dry Bones and Boo. The game takes you on 8 levels of madness and a star world that is just amazing to master. You also do have returning items including the mini-mushroom that makes Mario teeny but he is unable to fight his foes. Still, he can wade on water and leap quicker than the eye, and the might mega-mushroom which makes him king-sized to destroy anything from foes, and break pipes. It is like the invincible star, but also fierce. The game also features a few new power-ups in Mario's aid including the coin block, cap which will turn Mario's head into a coin factory that will keep adding coins and giving you 1-ups while playing. There is aldo the gold flower, which will turn you into Gold mario and Silver Luigi where you can fire at bricks and turn them into coins, and your foes and make them spit out and fire coins at you from Lakitu and the Hammer Brothers.The graphics are definitely worth their effort and stand out well. While the only flaw is the music by taking bits from New Super Mario Brothers Wii and not anything new to spin off of. The control remains as distinctive for you to play with Mario as you run and jump with great ease, and fly with the return of the raccoon leaf from Super Mario Brothers 3, that makes you flutter and fly in spots to grasp hard to reach coins. The fun is definitely great for seasoned Super Mario Brothers veterans as well as newcomers that have never played a Mario game yet. The learning curve might make it too easy for veterans to master at first like Super Mario 3D Land was, but the game is definitely addictive if you want to try and master the Coin Rush mode where you only have one life, to try and grasp as many coins as possible.All in all, there may be some gamers that might be turned off by New Super Mario Brothers 2, and more in wait for the upcoming New Super Mario Brothers U in regards to it being included with the Wii U soon. But I still definitely recommend New Super Mario Brothers 2 for the Nintendo 3DS and the new Nintendo 3DS XL. Not just because it is a great game, it still shows that some games and certain games have never lost their spirit with age. The Super Mario Brothers games have shown that for over 25 years ever since the NES came out. This one is definitely worth its money as a must buy for the Nintendo 3DS.Graphics: ASound: B+Control: AFun & Enjoyment: A-Overall: A-",5,Plumber Rush,2012/8/19 0:00

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B0088MVPFQ,,12,6,"In May of 2006 Nintendo released New Super Mario Bros.  A game that came back and introduced younger players to Mario's roots while appealing the nostalgia of older players.  It worked.  Better than anyone could've hoped for.  It quickly went on to become one of the best selling video games of all time.  Just a couple of years later Nintendo then released New Super Mario Bros. Wii adding in a lot of multiplayer support and bringing back even more nostalgia while also making a pretty challenging game.  New Super Mario Bros. 2 on the 3DS is the follow up to the original DS classic and it's good.  But by now New Super Mario Bros is starting to lose it's luster.The story is, as always, that Princess Peach has been kidnapped and once again Mario and Luigi have to go and save her.  Mario has been saving the Princess for almost three decades now and it's never going to change.  Mario has never been about story, however, it has always been about gameplay.  This is where New Super Mario Bros. 2 succeeds and... loses some of the allure.By now New Super Mario Bros isn't a way to introduce younger players to Mario's side scrolling roots or a means to appeal to nostalgia.  If you played the other New Super Mario Bros. games there's really nothing new"" here.  And that's actually okay by me.  Not every game needs to innovate, but perhaps adding something more might've been nice.  There are six worlds that you'll visit normally with two hidden worlds that can be accessed by going through a different path.  You'll travel across a world map.  About halfway through each world is a fortress and at the end is a castle.  The formula for New Super Mario Bros. hasn't changed one bit.  Some levels have hidden exits that take you off the beaten path to allow you to warp or skip over some levels, but most are beaten the standard way without a hidden exit.  And just like the other two games each level has three star coins for you to find.  And when you have enough you can spend them to unlock the way to a mushroom house for more rewards.  It's all standard stuff for New Super Mario Bros. by now.That's not to say the levels aren't well designed.  They start off pretty basic but pretty soon they become quite imaginative and fun to play through.  Much like the original New Super Mario Bros., however, it's not very challenging at all.  Despite some well designed levels there just isn't much the player has that will really throw them for a loop.  You'll breeze through the game rather quickly.  There is some replay there, but the adventure is over before you know it.Every Mario game seems to have its share of power ups and interesting quirks.  The original New Super Mario Bros. allowed Mario to hop into a blue shell.  New Super Mario Bros. Wii introduced the ice flower and penguin suit.  Even Mario 3D Land gave you the boomerang suit to use.  New Super Mario Bros. 2... doesn't really introduce anything or even try it's hand at doing so.  The only new thing here is the Gold Flower which allows Mario to shoot fire balls that turn bricks into gold coins for him to collect.  The return of Raccoon Mario might have been a nice play on one's nostalgia had Mario 3D Land not brought back the Tanooki suit.  And while Raccoon Mario can run and fly just as he did in Super Mario Bros. 3, it's not really a whole lot added.  The fire flower is back again, but we've never really been without it.  Aside from those power ups though, New Super Mario Bros. doesn't offer up a whole lot.  And this means it doesn't really have a lot of variety here from a gameplay standpoint.Nintendo usually tries to put something in there to keep you coming back, however.  And again, New Super Mario Bros. 2 doesn't quite do enough.  The original New Super Mario Bros. didn't always have a lot to keep you coming back, but it didn't really have to.  There was no bar set.  The Wii variation, however, had a special world that made collecting every star coin worth it to experience eight challenging stages.  It also offered up a multiplayer experience that actually helped it out as well.  Here, the big thing is collecting coins.  And it's about as exciting as it sounds.  You'll spend most of your time doing this as it is, but New Super Mario Bros. 2 pushes it.  And the game challenges you to get 1,000,000.  It's not a hard challenge, just a tedious one.  The game does all sorts of things to help you along.  You've got the gold flower, but you can also jump through gold rings to turn your enemies gold to the point that they'll drop more gold coins (and gold koopa shells that you kick leave a trail).  You can also bump blocks and carry around a gold block on your head that gives you more coins as you run around.  So there are plenty of means by which you can reach one million coins.  It'll just take time to do it.  In the process, of course, you'll easily rack up several lives.  I had more than thirty lives after just the first four stages alone.  The sheer number of lives you'll accumulate by default makes one wonder why Nintendo decided to pity players who die too much.  If you fail a certain number of times, you'll get the White Tanooki suit which will make you invincible in the level.  Considering how simple the game is and the untold number of lives you'll earn by default it's a wonder why it was necessary to include this.The thing about this emphasis on collecting coins is that you never really feel it adds a lot to the game.  Collecting coins in Mario is so basic.  We've been doing it since the first game and most times they've either only been seen as a means of getting more lives or, in some cases, a trail to lead us to a goal or show us where to go.  But collecting one million doesn't seem as though it will do much.  It just seems like a way to get you to keep playing.  And while just about everyone will probably take to the challenge, it does get incredibly monotonous after a while.  You're more likely to just play through it as you did any other Mario game not really caring about how many coins you've collected.That's not to say any of that is bad.  It just doesn't add a lot to the experience of the game.  The levels themselves are extremely well designed and there are A LOT of levels that one can play through.  Levels contain hidden exits to take you off the beaten path.  There are hidden worlds to explore as well.  It's not exactly a ""long"" game but it is one that can keep you busy for quite some time because there is plenty of reason to keep playing.  Either to actually collect the one million coins or to obtain all the star coins and find all the hidden exits.  There's reason to revisit levels when you're done.The multiplayer feature from New Super Mario Bros. Wii returns as well.  If a friend with a 3DS and a copy of the game wants they can help you traverse the stages here.  It's not quite as much fun as the Wii version in this regard.  And like the Wii version there will be times when you'll get in one another's way more so than not.  Also like the Wii version there's not much extra you get from actually playing multiplayer.  So it's not forced on you to actually complete the game.  There isn't much emphasis put on the multiplayer here, though.New Super Mario Bros. 2 looks really good as well.  It looks about the same as it did on the Wii.  Which means it's pretty and has a lot of nice smooth textures.  Those who play this game won't notice much of anything being animated differently from the Wii version.  Likewise, because it's a side scroller the 3D adds nothing to it--and really it shouldn't have to.  It's a pretty looking game, to be sure, there just isn't anything here you haven't seen before.The music, as you might've guessed, is also pretty much the same.  And like before, the enemies will dance to the beat of the music sometimes as well.  Nearly everything here is remixed from previous games in the New Super Mario Bros. lineup.New Super Mario Bros. 2 is still a really good game.  Mostly through great level design.  The good stuff about Mario doesn't cease to be good.  It's just hard not to wish Nintendo could've done more to it than simply seeing how many coins you could collect.  The gameplay is still solid as ever, and the adventure is still fun.  It's just a shame that New Super Mario Bros. 2 doesn't do much to expand from the previous iterations.""",4,Still Golden--Even if Some of the Shine Has Faded,2012/8/20 0:00

Basically this game takes 6-10 hours to beat and unlock the extras.  The comparisons to Super Mario Brothers 3 must be some sick peoples' ideas of jokes.  At the very surface this has some similarities to SMB3, but they are superficial at best.There is little challenge in this game.  You will lose lives, yes.  But when you have 200+ extra lives, it doesn't really matter.  So you can be bold without worrying too much about having to restart.  Extra lives are WAY too easy to come by.The goal more than anything seems to be collecting coins.  Even beating the game (both realms) seems trivial.  There are 6 worlds with 6 stages (or so) each.  Then there are 3 special worlds.  Then there are the Rainbow Worlds to secretly unlock.But all of this can be accomplished in an afternoon if one is dedicated.Buy the much better 3DS Mario title:Super Mario 3D Land.  It is by far the superior game.  If you have access to this game either through a game rental store or site, or local library, or even a friend, then borrow it for a few days.

I still think that this is not as good as the previous entry, New Super Mario Brothers for the DS or Super Mario in 3D Land.

While it doesn't have many exclusive games at the moment, you're buying into the PS4 for its potential. As Sony demonstrated with the PS3, they know how to create great games with characters you care about, not just soulless experiences that are, sadly, flooding the market on mobile devices. If you want high quality gaming experiences with cutting edge visuals, well-realized worlds and characters, Sony's developers have mastered that craft.As for the hardware itself, I've had no issues with it. There have been some complaints about the blue light of death error, disc read error, and some HDMI issues, but these issues seem to be within the acceptable failure rate for a new game console. Sony's competitors have also had issues reported with their consoles on the internet, so no matter which piece of hardware you buy, there's always the possibility that it could be a lemon, though it's not likely.

The hardware does get a bit warm when running a disc, but if you turn it off in standby mode the fans will continue to run until it has cooled down, then the fans will turn off, so that's nice.As for the controller, it fits well in my rather large hands and feels comfortable during long play sessions. With that said, it's not without issues. I have noticed that the analog stick covers are a bit cheaply made and can often start to wear off if you're rough with the controller. It's a bit of a shame that the controller can have some issues because otherwise it's a very nice controller overall.And as for the games, there aren't a ton of exclusives, but there's enough to satisfy you. My game recommendations are as follows:Infamous: Second Son - One of the best looking games out there, if not the best. Absolutely stunning open world environment.Killzone: Shadow Fall - Not my favorite Killzone game, but definitely still worth playing. It also boasts some impressive graphics.Warframe - It's free to play and it's great fun.Thief - Criminally underrated. Not perfect but I love it. Great atmospheric stealth action.There are more games that you may or may not like, but those are some that I've enjoyed the most.Overall, in my opinion, the PS4 is a very nice system that I can recommend to any gamer looking for a new console.",4,An Excellent Piece of Technology That's Affordably Priced,2014/3/26 0:00
A2A0FBLKJN4ZY5,B00BGA9WK2,W. freeman,0,0,"Upon purchasing both consoles after launch, I decided I only wanted one, especially for now. But wanted to do an in depth test of both.The Xbox One while clever with it's voice activated technology, via the kinect was just getting old. And I felt myself wanting to just pick up the controller and use it. Also it felt very dated, or 2002 as I like to say, very large in design, and just an over all unrefined feel. The PS4 on the other hand seems more polished and smooth, both in it's design, interface and overall performance. That's not to say that Xbox One game perform poorly, but I can honestly say the 50% GPU boost does improve not only graphics, but the overall feel"" of the gameplay. Certain games on the Xbox One seems to ""struggle"" a bit even on the simplest of games. When it comes to downloads they are about the same. For instance on the PS4 I got the online gamecode for Knack since it's much cheaper, saw it was a 35gb file and downloaded it in less then two hours. It really takes advantage of my 50mb connection with boosts up to 70mb. Which also make online gaming quite a treat, along with any extensive updates.So here is the basic rundown of both systems and why I chose PS4, which was pretty obvious to me after the initial purchases about 2 weeks apart.PS4 ProsMust more refined, design, interface etc.Sharper graphics, even the home screen is much much clearer50% more power is just that, and makes a difference in gaming performance overall, not just graphicsThe small speaker feature on the controller is actually cool.Doesn't use a lot of gimmicks to get it's point across100$ cheaper, better exclusives in the future. And remember nothing beats Sony Exclusives, never have never will.Smaller, quiet, runs hot, but nothing alarming.Much faster response on the home screen, no lag, boots up much faster.Cons-Not manyThe PSN (store) seems to disappear from time to time and just give a blue screen. Nothing major, just hibernate, bring it back up, and it stays. Just a strange glitch.The controller is good, but I will admit i think the Xbox controller (even on 360) has a bigger, more controlled feel.Mixed feelings about the new Playstation Now, since I'll never get rid of my PS3, for all my multimedia. And backlog of games. Also I won't need to play old games much.No MP3 streaming or playback from a USB Flashdrive device (yet).Xbox One ProsThe Kinect when it works, but this feature is a gimmick and got/will get old with time.The controllerA few games (more) from launch and recently that are not on PS4. Nothing spectacular though.Xbox Cons-Hence why I didn't go with it.Big, bulky, the power brick, looks like a 1977 beta player. May help keep it cooler, that's about it.Games feel bogged down, even the simple ones. Some games have framerate drops, and shouldn't.Interface it ok, but feels very convoluted, messy, and needs a lot of fine tuning.Poor sales, reviews, no promotion, and overall hate for the system doesn't really make you want to keep it.I feel at this point in technologies era, everything should be full 1080p or close, and have the latest hardware. Xbox One doesn't.Having to pay for apps you're already paying for via Xbox Live is robbery, IMO. Netflix being the most popular.Not nearly as many exclusives as PS4 will have. You can do a lot more with games like Uncharted, a next gen The Last Of Us, God Of War, Motorstorm etc. Than you can with Halo and Gears of Bore.So that's basically it, I feel that IMO the PS4 is superior, and the Xbox One is inferior. And it should be a good creative balance, which to me it is not, with the Xbox lagging behind in every way. I'm a 38 year old man btw, not some fanboy, or young teen defending my product so all of my friends will think I'm the man. I have worked on computers for years, built gaming rigs, so I prefer quality, and quantity. And I know great technology when I see it. And even though there isn't a lot happening right now, the PS4 flies off shelves faster than any console I've ever seen, and this is starting from Atari back in 1978, when I was about 3. I don't hate the Xbox, but I feel it wasn't promoted, or built with the future in mind, for gamers. Only for multimedia living rooms where people can take advantage of it. Also Sony is certainly known for it's great reliability, and has been around for nearly 60 years. So as I said not really many questions left to ask as to why I chose it.""",5,Why I Ultimately Chose The PS4,2013/11/16 0:00
A1TY4TRLA4QK5Y,B00C7103DO,"Brian Long Brian""""",3,2,"Batman needs no introduction. From the wonderful beginnings of Arkham Asylum, the new chefs that've taken over cooked up another awesome batch of asskicking from the same tried recipe.The story is top notch. Batman, much younger and still feeling out a relationship with Gotham PD. This gives a great chance to introduce new and old villains with a feel of novelty and adventure. And the twists are so subtlely delivered that only on the second playthrough can you see them being set up.Gameplay is classic, with a few enhancements. Several new enemy types add real spice and novelty to the traditional setup, and the gadgets are clumsier and bulkier to reflect them being in development. I really liked how the disruptor was the size of a shotgun rather than a garage door opener. Upgrades and level are vastly more expansive and organic, and the leveling is spaced enough to not feel dumped on you but consistent enough you don't feel like you're grinding.Also novel are the crime scenes. While they're a bit railroaded in feel, its nice to have the new feel be more exploration and discovery than just scan four items and be done with it. The enigma riddle setup is slightly modified as well, with more a feel of eroding an enemy power base than collecting randomly scattered trophies, as well as a much more organic reason for doing the collection.Only a handful of issues prevent this from being five stars. Most infuriating, combat has reintroduced the flawed ground takedown that renders you helpless for several moments, meaning its very easy to have a freeflow interrupted. The story hiccups at a few points. At one point, you have to enter Lacey Towers. But theres no indication where that is on the map, and when you find it, to get inside you have to somehow know you need to beat up two cops on a different nearby building, cause that makes total sense. Some of the side bosses are so brief as to not even be appetizers, such as deathstroke being a single fight despite being touted as a major villain. Some aspects aren't well explained, like there's no on"" button on the generators you find, you have to have a story gadget. But even these glitches are only a few smudges.Overall, this is superb. Great story, well revamped combat, and novel, well crafted villains make this another great addition to the series.""",4,"Still Batman, but a little unpolished (Minor spoilers)",2013/10/27 0:00

AFV2584U13XP3,B00C7103DO,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),17,10,"Just started playing the game and all I can say is Awesome! The game is set more in the open world of Arkham City rather the Arkham Asylum as you're allowed more free roaming experience around the city then in a set area.The gampeplay controls are pretty much exactly like the previous two games meaning that you have the X or square button(Xbox 360/PS3 controller) for attacks or dive attacks if your on a higher area looking down at the enemies,Y or triangle for the counter attacks when you see the lightning bolt symbol above the enemies heads signalling that their about to attack you or to drop a smoke pellet if enemies or armed,the A or X button to jump or evade certain attacks, and B or the circle button to use Batman's cape to disorientate enemies rather then do the counter move.  And of course when you're target with either the Batarang or Batclaw you use L2 or LT to target and R2 or RT to fire.The cross control pad allows you to access Batman's array of gadgets like the batclaw/batarang/explosive gel etc,etc. The LB or L1 allows you to enter detective mode to see certain aspects like enemies or clues and such just like the previous games.The graphics are topnotch a little better detailed then Arkham City though just by a little and the buildings around the city do indeed seem taller allowing you more range to scout and glide down and around the city.  The A.I. for the enemies and villains seemed more adept too though again not by much from the previous games.The story so far shows it is before Arkham Asylum where Batman has apparently just started making a name for himself in Gotham so the bad guys still think of him as more a bogey man rather then the known crime fighter he is in Arkham Asylum/City.So if you played or have the previous two games I definitely say this one is a must have though it's not really necessary to have the previous games if you just started as this is a prequel to those games it's still a good choice to add those to your gaming library.",5,Great Game After Arkham City Though Technically The Story Is Set Before Arkham Asylum,2013/10/25 0:00

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00C7103DO,S. Rhodes,84,71,"The Good:+A really good story+Good graphics+Strong voice acting brings it to life+Familiar free flowing combat is still satisfying+Lots of side missions to keep you busy+A strong multiplayer componentThe Bad:-Gotham City feels strangely lifeless-Some of it is just a little too familiar.  There's nothing here that builds upon what Arkham City established before it.  This isn't necessarily &#34;bad&#34; but the experience feels far too similar---When Batman Arkham Asylum came out, it was a burst of fresh air and a relief.  For the first time in a very long time the Batman license was put to good use.  Arkham City then turned out to be a really good sequel in its own right with a fantastic story and a fantastic open world, building up on what Arkham Asylum established and managing to feel different just the same.  Now we have Batman Arkham Origins.  A prequel that is set in Gotham just two years after Wayne has dawned the cape and cowl.  It's a good game in its own right, and is really only hindered by the fact that it does little (if anything) to set itself apart from the game that came before it.  But then again... Arkham City is a hard act to follow.The criminal Black Mask has put a 50 million dollar bounty on Batman's head.  As such, assassins from all over are coming to Gotham to take that bounty on.  In conjunction with that, the police aren't sure if Batman is helping to escalate crime or if he's actually stopping them.  Origins actually has a really good story.  It doesn't reach the heights of Arkham City, but it's good nonetheless, establishing the relationships that Batman has with some criminals and with some of the characters we've come to know and love.  The production values are as top notch as you'd expect.  The voice acting, despite a different cast of voice actors for Batman and The Joker, is quite good in its own right.  The game also has a good graphical presentation, making for a good looking game.  Although the one problem I have with it is that the game gives a pitiful excuse as to why there are no citizens wandering the city--a curfew.  In a way it sort of drains Gotham of life and more or less just makes Gotham seem like a bigger Arkham City.  There are side missions but none of them ever really involve saving citizens.  Usually just going around beating up criminals.Speaking of that, the free-flowing combat is exactly the same as you remember.  This isn't such a bad thing.  You'll be beating up thugs and have a chance to counter them just as you always have.  You get weapons that help you in your beat downs, but aside from that this is the same familiar combat system you've always known.  Which is fine and dandy, although this doesn't make boss fights exciting on any level.  In the previous games some bosses there were very specific tasks that had to be done.  The fight with characters like Mr. Freeze in Arkham City come to mind.  But here it's mostly just like fighting another thug.  The boss fights here just aren't that exciting to play.Like in previous games you'll find lots of gadgets for Batman to use.  However, just like the combat, there's not really anything new here.  At some point a lot of ground just feels too familiar.  The new studio behind Batman Arkham Origins seems to have gotten caught in the trap that many developers get caught in.  Certainly you don't need to fix what isn't broken, but there are times when Batman Arkham Origins feels like it's lifting far too much from the previous game without laying down any new track.  It's not really building on the foundation set before it, This isn't quite as bothersome in many regards, but it makes the game feel like baby steps from the previous game as opposed to great strides.  Many of the side missions you'll come to expect such as the Riddler trophies or just running around the city to beat up thugs.  But there are some pretty cool side missions that actually do add to the story and give you the sense of the relationship that Batman has with his adversaries.  That's not to say there is nothing new.  You can actually access the Batcave here.  You can get some advice from Alfred and you can change your suit and go train.  It's nice to have a bit of a hub area this time around.What actually works out surprisingly well is the multiplayer.  I never pictured the Arkham games as needing a multiplayer.  And a lot of the times when there's a multiplayer component added to a game that was clearly not built up for one it's usually pretty poor (Tomb Raider comes to mind).  Here it actually works.  You play as either Batman and Robin or as thugs trying to take them down.  It's actually really intense and quite fun.  Batman and Robin employ various takedowns while thugs have guns at their disposal.  It's surprisingly fun to play.Arkham Origins exceeds on a technical level, having some really good looking character models and good looking environments.  As mentioned it doesn't feel as alive as it could be, but it's not a bad looking game by any means.  The soundtrack is one of the biggest rewards here.  It's a really good one.  About what you'd expect from an Arkham game.  The only thing that keeps Arkham Origins down is that so much of it feels like a retread of familiar territory.  There's nothing here that really tries to build on the foundation of what was already established in the game before it.  Arkham City did a good job of building up on what was established in Asylum despite having a lot of familiar gameplay.  It feels like the developers here were playing it safe.  The good news is that Origins isn't a step back.  It's just not a big step forward.  It does have it where it counts, though.  A strong story and a good narrative to accompany it.  If you liked the previous Arkham games then Origins is worth your time.",4,"Familiar Territory, But a Fun Game Nonetheless",2013/10/26 0:00
A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B00C7103DO,Winter,0,0,"DISCLAIMER:  I've fully played this game on both the PS3 and the PC.The short version:As a fan of both Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, I would have been perfectly happy with 'more of the same', and in many ways that's what we get in Arkham Origins.  Most of the game only slightly expands upon the previous two entries.Unfortunately, here we are 6 months later and its biggest detriment is still the bugs--not just annoying glitches but real show-stoppers.  If these could be ironed out, we'd have a 5-star entry in the series that lacks only a bit in the area of storyline and 'new ideas'.The details:Arkham Origins tells us the story of Gotham City prior to the Arkham Asylum and Arkham City storylines.  What makes the story so wonderful is not only some excellent writing that really digs into the depth of Batman and the Joker, and reaches into the mob families that flesh out Batman's world in works like 'The Long Halloween' and 'Dark Victory'...but we also gain insights into a ton of hanging story ideas that were there in Arkham City, making the entire arc of these games seamless.  In Arkham City, you have clues that talk about Black Mask and he's never in the game--why?  Because we get his story here.  Why did Penguin refer in Arkham City to something Batman did to him?  Little details like this add to the magic.  Arkham City also begs the question, Why is everything in here blown up and ruined?"" and we get answers to that too.  In fact, it's pretty breathtaking the first time you set foot into the Gotham of Arkham Origins and it's not only whole, it's colorful and lit up for Christmastime.The beginning of the game establishes that right now the cops in Gotham City are really corrupt, and Jim Gordon is one of the few who isn't on the take from mobs and/or supervillains.  It also sets the stage for a mostly-empty city by saying a severe storm has forced evacuation...leaving us with cops and criminals wandering around looking for a fight.Unfortunately, the much larger territory and more open-world feel also take us away from a sense of the story's urgency.  Arkham Asylum walked you on a path to the final battle, and it was a big important fight.  Arkham City played connect-the-dots with the main story elements and its 'Protocol Ten' countdown really built the tension.  Arkham Origins hits you the wrong way at both ends:  storylines swearing you need to act fast aren't affected if you decided to wander around and explore...and at the same time, random police alerts go off on the radio and after the first dozen red-alert alarm calls you start to feel like stopping crimes won't make a difference because 30 seconds later there will be another one demanding you answer it...but not really meaning anything except lost XP if you don't.The Good:Combat flow is intricate and harder--you really need to take a more defensive stance and be willing to give yourself an edge by using gadgets.The achievement trees are hard to navigate because it appears that you have to knock out most of the achievements in order.The storyline does make the boss battles vary, though for the most part the combinations you use aren't any different from the prior games.We get some great dialog.  For example, (minor spoiler here) that first exchange in which Gordon meets Batman, that we've seen played over and over in movies and books, has Jim basically saying, ""We have a system!"" (and vigilantes don't fit) and Batman calmly responding, ""If your system worked, I wouldn't be here.""The Bad:The PS3 version of the game strains under the load:  frame rate can get really choppy at times or the game itself seems to periodically need to take a deep breath between actions.Bugs can deny you an achievement.  They can cause the combat flow to come to a halt.  They can punish you for blocking because someone else got inserted in between you and your opponent.  An exciting multiple-takedown move usually starts with Batman popping up in the air, time slowing down...and then there's about a 50/50 chance that the move breaks and nothing happens.  Combat seems far too eager to take guy-with-knife and lock you into having to take him on head-to-head, even when you're ridiculously far away and moving further.  At least one bug has had me finish one of the hardest boss battles I've ever faced, only to be unable to leave the arena.  We've had major fixes released, but this one hit me again just last week.  More than one time I've had to reload a checkpoint and replay to re-earn what I'd rightfully accomplished.  And there are times when someone you're supposed to interrogate simply can't be interacted with--leave the area and/or reload.Really, given that 'more of the same' would make me happy, it's the bugs that make Arkham Origins such a disappointment.The Ugly:The PS3 version of the game is so unstable that I've twice had it freeze up a PS3 system that's less than a year old, completely shutting the machine down.It was kind of fun in the earlier games having to take snapshots of clues to answer the Riddler--that has been removed and I suspect it's because it was too hard or required too much Batman knowledge.  We don't have green question marks, so instead we collect green data packets.  Some of the data packets won't be there until you Interrogate one of the bad guys, which can get annoying when the packet in question requires a long one-way walk back through a level you've completed...and in one case the Interrogate suspect never showed due to a bug and I had to keep waiting until another time and checking again until he showed up.  Some of these one-way levels then require you to turn around and go all the way back to leave again.  It tends to turn things into a bit of a rote exercise, and that can be more frustrating when you realize that you're going to need to complete a large chunk of the main story just to be able to try your hand at the puzzles.  I won't spoil the game for you but I will say that one particular large confrontation turns into a nothing of non-battle, no exploration, just a tiny room and words exchanged.  The world is really huge, so they've added a 'fast travel' ability, but you won't be able to fast travel to an area until you've completely taken down a random scattering of items.  Last, playing 'New Game Plus' does NOT give you access to all of the gadgets you earned beating the game, but only those not central to the storyline...this is a shame because I really didn't want to repeat some of the boss battles and now that will be the only way to really get through the side stories, clues, and achievements.All in all, I loved the game enough to play it through twice, but I also found myself far more disappointed when things went wrong: it's like taking delivery of a beautiful Ferrari, only to find that the motor misfires and the Check Engine Light makes constant beeping noises.

A2IGEPJJYKMOWK,B00CMQTVK0,UziHorowitz,3,1,"Xbox One was initially announced and revealed this past June and received a lot of heat for its DRM policy that would've hurt used game sales. I was one of those people who wasn't fond of such an idea. Even though I buy mostly new games, I didn't like that the disc was pretty much a coaster after you installed it, as I'm the kind of gamer that likes to have a collection of physical games and not have everything online-only. So I wasn't going to buy an Xbox One.Fast forward to them announcing that they were doing away with the awful DRM stuff and I was sold. I then pre-ordered one along with a PS4. While I was turned off by their original plans for the console, they heard the complaints and did the right thing, even if it was a tough pill for Microsoft to swallow.So now what we have is a game console like any other. Whether it's a new or used game, it'll work, and this is the way it should remain for any future game consoles. As we saw with the PSP Go, the digital-only model doesn't work for this industry unless we're talking Steam.Onto the console, the Xbox One is a large device and pretty weighty, but it has a very reliable feel to it. The Blu-ray drive is quiet and takes the disc smoothly, you can hardly hear the fans, and the whole thing is generally whisper quiet. In addition, the user interface is smooth and works very intuitively with the new Kinect.And let's not forget the Xbox One controller which feels like a durable and well-made piece of hardware including an improved d-pad and ergonomics from the Xbox 360 controller.As for games, Xbox One has a great launch library.A quick rundown of some of the games I've played:Dead Rising 3 - Large sandbox game, tons of zombies, tons of weapons and vehicles to combine and modify, lots of side quests and leveling up, etc. Nice graphics for a sandbox game this large.Ryse - Very underrated. Not sure what's with the low reviews, to be honest. It's a bit repetitive, I do agree, but the graphics are the best I've seen and the combat is excellent. It also has a nice story.Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag - This version looks a lot better than the last gen version. Open world game with nice lighting and weather effects.Killer Instinct - Buttery smooth net code, good roster of characters, nice fighting mechanics. This game will continue to get new content throughout 2014.Crimson Dragon - Classic on-rails game in the vein of Panzer Dragoon. Another underrated game.Forza Motorsport 5 - Great graphics, nice tracks, good physics, etc. Lots of content to be had.Xbox One is a great console with great games. And to make it even better, 2014 is shaping up to be a great year for exclusives.Here are some 2014 exclusives:Quantum BreakTitanfall (also on PC but exclusive to Xbox One on consoles)Sunset OverdriveD4Kinect Sports RivalsHalo 5Fable Legends",5,Xbox One's a top notch gaming console and entertainment device all in one,2013/11/22 0:00
A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B00CMQTVK0,Winter,8,6,"The XBox One is a sizeable step forward.  Like any technological gadget, there are some aspects where you can see the vision, but we're not there yet...however Microsoft has done very well this time around and I'm confident the console will continue to improve as time goes on.  As someone who rants a lot about horrible Live experiences, overheating power bricks, and the Red Ring of Death, that's saying a lot.HARDWARE AND CONTROLSFirst, the box isn't smaller than an XBox 360, but it is very quiet, even when it's been on for a while.  It still has a slab of a power brick and big clunky connectors for it.  The unit is smart enough to integrate with your home theater system, detecting your model of TV and/or Receiver and trying to communicate with it where possible (for me, it could turn the TV on and off but not the receiver).  The Kinect device that connects to the unit is a bigger chunk of hardware than the 360's Kinect, and I get the impression there's more under the hood that we'll be seeing from the new Kinect.  For now, its primary purpose is to let you log in by sitting down, knowing which person is playing (and setting up separate profiles) via face recognition, and listening for your voice commands.Voice commands are mostly there, but not perfect.  It's easy to issue orders like Xbox On"", or even ""XBox, I want to listen to Imagine Dragons"", but then sometimes commanding a button with a phrase like ""Accept this setting"" doesn't go well.  It helps to speak naturally and not try to enunciate words slowly, and I understand that over time it will learn your voice.The controller feels like a more compact version of the XBox 360 controller, which is a bit of a shame in that I really loved the larger 360's spread.  Still, the controller works great.  Apart from feeling my left thumb stretch a bit more to reach the stick, I'm satisfied.  The XBox logo button is at the top edge, reducing the possibility of accidentally bumping it when things get frantic, and Start and Select are tiny--which does mean in low light I have to look closely to find them...I imagine I'll get the hang of that over time though.APPS AND INTERFACESome of the Windows 8 features make their way to the One:  the interface looks similar, as if the XBox 360's menus were further condensed to look even more like Windows 8's Start Menu.  The apps and Store look the same (and probably are the same under the covers) and so we easily get Skype, Netflix, and Amazon Instant Video with a download.  A lot of the basic setup menus are made as simple as possible, and one of my favorite aspects is how the XBox One simplifies all those darn codes:  when you want to unlock something you no longer have to use a controller to type in that long string of letters and numbers--just wave the QR Code in front of the Kinect and it'll do the rest.That said, some of these apps really need some polish.  The Music application doesn't appear to let you do much beyond access the Microsoft-supplied content and my SkyDrive, and when I told it to stream Imagine Dragons (and similar sounds--it shuffles other artists in like Pandora does), it probably shouldn't have handed me Eminem's ""Mockingbird"" and a country-pop hit that I couldn't stand.  Trying to add a local source of music or manage any of my collection that wasn't in my SkyDrive turned out to be impossible, and it has no idea I have a home network, let alone that I have two Windows Home Servers (a 2003 and a 2011) or that just about everything in my home is DLNA-capable in one way or another.  The same is also true of Video--right now, unless I use content available in an app, nothing's available...and this is also limited.  My Music session counted down that I can listen to X many songs before I have to pay to have it.  US$99/year or more...no thank you.  There are a lot of TV-centric functions that work when you connect your cable box/DVR, but you'll have to have an HDMI out to do it--no older Component/optical options.GAMESSo now we're on to games, and with the unit being only a few days old, thus far I only have Forza Motorsport 5.  However, I can tell the XBox One's hardware is well-used:  not only are Forza's graphics gorgeous, but there are times when the physics engine is put to the test.  I'm thinking in particular of one Top Gear track where hundreds of random objects are getting crashed into and bounced around, flying all over the place in a realistic fashion but with not one stutter to the framerate.  There's a huge amount of controversy right now in that the games are rendered in 1080p by upscaling a 720p resolution on the fly.  I've got good eyes, but try as I might really cannot tell the difference.  Graphics are simply beautiful.  It's also nice that you can multi-task:  for example, spin up some music while playing a game (now if Music could just work a bit better!).  We are definitely looking at next-gen hardware, and I look forward to seeing more titles (Halo, anyone?) added to the console in the coming months.If you're considering the XBox One, it really is a great console.  It's rough around the edges in ways that I expect to be resolved over time.  It doesn't have a huge game library to offer out-of-the-gate, but thus far we do have a lot or greatness ahead of us.""",4,Off to a Great Start,2013/11/25 0:00
A2582KMXLK2P06,B00DC7G0GG,B. E Jackson,12,7,"For me Super Mario 3D World is only a passable sequel to Super Mario 3D Land.  The biggest problem is that despite the staggering amount of ideas found throughout the game, most of them are only encountered a couple times, or never last long enough to leave much of an impression.  This makes the game feel less of an adventure and more like a series of mini games, which is what Galaxy 2 mostly suffers from.  The clear pipe concept is a new addition to the series, but it's actually overrated because it's never particularly fun for one thing (except for level 6-3 which uses the pipes more than the other stages) and also because it's hardly ever used extensively.  For 90% of the time you encounter clear pipes, they only serve a brief purpose of going to a new area which is basically a similar idea to the launching stars from the Super Mario Galaxy series.  Hopefully people are exaggerating when they say it's innovative- all you do is automatically go through pipes, and rarely collect items or dodge traps and enemies.  It's not very interesting, trust me.  Then again, something other than the standard green pipes is a nice change of direction for Mario I suppose.  I can understand people defending it entirely for this reason.Another problem is that many people assumed with a new Nintendo console we'd have an epic and original Mario adventure on an innovative scale like the Galaxy series, but 3D World falls incredibly short in that regard.  A sequel to a handheld game being advertised a a mega Mario adventure on Nintendo's relatively new Wii U console has to be considered a disappointment.  Not exactly a brilliant way to show off a new gaming system. The good news is that you can play as four different characters each with their own unique moves- Luigi jumps high, Toad moves fast, Princess Peach floats a great distance, and Mario is the most well-rounded character of the bunch.  This feature was first introduced in Super Mario Bros. 2 for the NES and, even though most of the stages in 3D World are easily beatable regardless of the character (which could be considered a flaw as well, since it means these levels weren't designed with each characters strengths and weaknesses in mind) the choices in playable characters is a nice feature.While the cat suit is a unique suit that moves realistically to an actual cat, it's probably the most broken item in the Mario series due to the fact you can not only attack with it, you can also climb walls and skip portions of levels.  It's really fun to mess around with don't get me wrong, but it's also overused like mad since at least half of the stages in the game use it.  The double cherry"" concept where you have more than one Mario, Luigi, Toad or Princess Peach on screen at the same time is somewhat enjoyable, but also distracting and often times confusing as well.  Too much of a good thing.  Also, small complaint, but the flagpole finish has been used way too often by this point, and I'd like to see Nintendo offer more in the way of variety and other options because jumping on a flagpole and being encouraged to reach the top is not only tiresome and overused, but needlessly nostalgic.  Maybe something like matching 3 mushrooms, flowers or stars like in Super Mario Bros. 3 would be a more interesting way to end a level in the next Mario title, or better yet, the flower roulette wheel from Yoshi's Island (a personal favorite of mine).  Or perhaps something else entirely.  Something other than the dang flagpole all the time.The one really bright spot is the music.  I'm someone who can live without most of the music in Mario games but Super Mario 3D World is a major exception.  The variety is astounding, but it's also the type of music never heard before in a Mario game.  Some people argue whether catchy music or more classical compositions are more appropriate for the Mario series but the truth is, what *really* matters is whether the notes are good or not.  In this case, the music is constantly terrific.  It's jazzy but not in an annoying and distracting kind of way like in Galaxy 2, but in a more upbeat and memorable way that fits well with the level themes.  The water levels jazzy music is amazingly good for example.  There's so many excellent theme songs in this game that it's ridiculous.  An *incredible* well-done job there.  Also the green star concept has returned.  You have to collect 3 green stars per stage to open up other levels later on.  It's important to try and make an effort to collect *all* of these so you can see all the levels the game has to offer.Now let me describe each level in specific detail.  I will rank the amount of enjoyment each level provides using a familiar 1-5 scale, and mention how difficult the stage is for me using ""easy, medium or hard"".  This is going to be fun!  Hope you like reading!  Please note that the rest of this review from here on out can be interpreted as major SPOILERS.  Please keep this in mind.  If you haven't played the game yet and don't want to know what happens, don't read the rest of my review.1-1.  Generic grasslands stage, first appearance of the cat suit, sparse enemy-wise, catch rabbits (2-easy) 1-2.  Underground stage with purple bricks, goombas, green koopas, a cool infinite 1-up secret, same underground music since the original SMB on the NES but of course remixed (2-easy).  Love how the sunlight shines through the cracks.  1-3.  Another grasslands level with piranha plants that recalls Yoshi Star Galaxy from Super Mario Galaxy 2 where you climb higher on generic building blocks, and a cloud world similar to the ones you experience in 3D Land is found here (2-easy).  1-A.  A room where you have to battle charging chucks, a returning enemy from Super Mario World (3-easy).  1-4.  Riding a big dinosaur creature (NOT Yoshi) through rings and across ramps over a river of water.  Too short but fun while it lasts.  It feels like a less adventurous version of the Manta Ray levels from Super Mario Galaxy due to lacking the adrenaline rush of surfing the big waves (4-easy).  1-5.  A carninal/palace type setting that's very colorful.  You have to jump on blue tiles and turn them yellow while climbing through the stage which is a clear Galaxy reference- magikoopas first appear here too (3-easy).  1-Toad.  This is the first of many Toad levels in the game where you're in a tiny cube-shaped geometrical maze building and you have to obtain all the green stars.  You will be constantly rotating the camera around to get a better view, believe me.  In fact you HAVE to rotate the camera.  This one consists of green platforms and it's painfully simplistic (1-easy).  1-Castle.  You basically have to toss soccer ball-like cannon bombs at goombas while jumping across easy platforms and raising building structures.  While Bowser's car chase battle is barely strategic here, it does intensify later on in the game.  Love the jazzy/heavy metal music combination of the two styles during the Bowser fight (4-easy).2-1.  Egyptian/sand themed level with big pecking birds as enemies, quirky-moving platforms that can be quite the intimidating spectacle at first, and a cool bonus stage with falling coins as the Super Mario Bros. 2 character select music plays here.  The violin music is great in the main area of the stage (4-easy).  2-2.  Beautiful nighttime and pink/purple platform setting with ambient piano.  Reminds me of Sweet Mystery Galaxy from Galaxy 2 in both level design and music.  The glowing debris particles provides beautiful eye candy.  Another cloud world as well (3-easy).  2-3.  Underground level surrounded by silver bricks where you can pick up and carry a piranha plant and make it munch/eat other enemies which honestly makes it comparable to using Yoshi.  A fine substitute to Yoshi.  Love the way you can walk behind walls and see nothing but the shadows of yourself and the enemies.  Can you say ""crumbling Bowser statue?"" (3-easy).  2-4.  The most popular level in the game due to it being the example level we've been seeing for months illustrating the cat suits abilities.  Grassland level with decent design- an improvement over the similar grass-themed levels in World 1.  Monty moles everywhere, and the underground portion's too brief (3-easy).  2-A.  Battle 3 large monty moles (2-easy).  2-B.  Battle a variety of enemies in succession (4-medium).  2-5.  A pink Barbie doll-type level.  Very straight forward with the ability to collect the double cherries that I mention in paragraph 3.  Platforms comparable to skateboard ramps but it's a dull level without the use of the double cherries.  Makes me think it's a deliberately unspectacular level designed just so Nintendo can sell the double cherry concept (2-easy).  2-Castle.  Scrolling diagonal tank level with bullet bills and smashable crates where you have the ability to shoot cannonballs wearing a suit.  Cool concept.  Boom Boom fight identical to 3D Land's except he turns invincible sometimes (3-easy).3-1.  Straight forward snow level with snowman enemies, ability to pick up and toss snowballs at enemies, ride iceskate-shaped snowmobiles, knock out goombas riding in snowmobiles and chase rabbits.  Winter music is heroic and memorable (4-easy).  3-2.  A scrolling grassland level where you have to jump over (or climb with the cat suit) upright-moving gates.  The big band music is somewhat inappropriate for such a stage, but still a pretty good theme.  You encounter donut lifts later on (2-easy).  3-3.  A ghost house.  LOVE the violin classical music.  Floating couches can be found, as well as a cube-shaped rotating green star room that's enough to make you dizzy!  Boos and big boos, library setting in the background- surprised the books don't fly off the shelves!  Love the giant mirror, falling escalator steps and the surprising fake flagpole at the end (4-easy).  3-4.  A short timer level where you have to jump across platforms that resemble a cake with one or more pieces missing while collecting 10-second timer-increasing clocks like in Galaxy 2.  Avoid piranha plants and goombas, find another cloud bonus and search for more catchable rabbits.  It's too short (3-easy).  3-Toad.  Less generic than the Toad cube house in World 1 but still easy (2-easy).  3-A.  Defeat 3 magikoopas (1-easy).  3-5.  Beach level with goombas floating on rafts- more jazz music that's even better than the music found in 3-2.  LOVE how the music changes to aquatic when you're underwater and avoiding spiked puffer fish.  The sunken ship background while flowing through clear pipes is *unbelievably* pretty (4-easy).  3-6.  Fast-paced running/jumping Sonic the Hedgehog or Super Mario Kart-type level with speed boosts and ramps and making sure you cross donut lifts and avoid piranha plants with care (5-medium).  3-7.  More jazzy instrumentation.  Unique level in appearance- Autumn-like setting with brown platforms, shallow water, bee enemies, electrical amp enemies from Super Mario Galaxy 2.  The waterfall portion is effectively atmospheric.  Love how you jump inside the waterfall in one part and move around on those returning left/right green arrow platforms from Super Mario 3D Land.  Avoid the rolling caterpillars!  A nice challenge of a stage (4-medium).  3-Castle.  You have to ride a train avoiding homing bullet bills  (some of them big) and avoid floaty-type enemies.  The battle with the female boomerang-tossing Boom Boom and her clones is easy but the level itself is hard (5-hard).  3-B.  A carnival level where you have to battle a purple snake- this is famous and familiar due to all the previews of the game showing it constantly.  Climb on top of the cymbal-like platforms attached to the heads of smaller snakes that pop out of the ground while avoiding boulders (3-medium).4-1.  A sandy level where you have to climb across platforms avoiding/defeating purple ant-like clingy enemies that can walk around platforms (Metroid Prime 2 influence no doubt).  Later on you have to bounce on top of super-sized ants to avoid dropping into the spikes below (3-easy).  4-2.  A beautiful jungle theme with pink-headed vined piranha plants slithering out of walls, ceilings and floors like snakes.  Strange level, but awesome in appearance.  The green platforms mixed with purple lava (or dark matter) is a sight to behind (3-easy).  4-A.  Simply throw boulders into the lava (2-easy).  4-3.  Similar to Beat Block Galaxy from SMG2 with the disappearing platforms.  You have to avoid boomerang brothers.  The level is bland and derivative except for the long slide at the end which makes the challenge go up a tad (3-easy).  4-4.  Grasslands stage with bounceable platforms and spinys.  Fun but very easy except for the enemy-populated area near the end (2-easy).  4-B.  A series of easy tasks- bouncy grassland platforms, running up a ramp, being chased by big homing bullet bills, avoiding the dropping thwomps, riding across swingable platforms, avoiding rolling spiked logs, etc.  Medium challenge due to so much taking place.  Admittedly it can seem like an overwhelming series of incoherent chores until you get the hang of it (4-medium).  4-5.  Stone structure level where you must avoid rolling spiked logs, climb ramps, turn blue panels yellow, deal with swinging platforms with rolling spiked logs on top of them (VERY tricky part here if you're too slow) (4-medium).  4-Castle.  Disappointingly short level with boulders you can pick up (like in 4-A) and toss them at stacked goombas walking around and very little in the way of threats.  Giant boulder boss is fun but way too easy (2-easy).5-Toad.  Toad ghost house-themed cube level with trippy and awesome music.  Collect the green stars.  I can tell these type of levels are getting more elaborate with each one (3-easy).  5-1.  Beach level with green koopas and charging chucks.  Memorable jazzy beach music like in 3-5.  You can experiment with a wide variety of power-ups including koopa shell, goomba and boomerang brother constumes which are all really fun to use.  The rainbow-colored underground floor panel segment is cool, as is the dinosaur water ride.  The variety is really solid (4-easy).  5-2.  A carnival castle level with upbeat carnival music and a dark cloudy background which makes the level unusual to admire.  You have to swing across colorful panels that basically serve as vines like in Donkey Kong.  The piranha plant merry-go-round is neat to see (2-easy).  5-3.  100 seconds to grab green stars/reach flagpole.  Really short and bland with very little danger (1-easy).  5-A.  A room filled with charging chucks.  Easy and short (2-easy).  5-4.  Grassy level with a beautiful shade of yellow due to a sunset in the background.  Avoid fuzzies between clear pipes and more purple ants.  The second half is better with rotating platforms and a wide open grassy/bushy Zelda-like section chasing rabbits and avoiding a trail of coin-carrying ants (2-easy).  5-5.  Underground bob-omb level with rotating platform rabbit chases, and having to toss bombs at stacked goombas to create explosions and open new areas and secrets.  Simplistic floor panel puzzle (3-easy).  5-6.  Flippable blue/red panels from 3D Land and Galaxy, electrical round currents return from the Galaxy series too.  Really unique platform jumping puzzle can be found here that involves properly rolling a boulder to a location at the bottom in a screen that resembles the original Mario Bros. arcade game from the mid 80's.  Pretty fun level despite being generic and familiar (3-easy).  5-7.  Weird robotic snapping-type square enemies that are pesky but can be picked-up and carried, or used to bounce on top of as a way to reach higher areas.  Homing torpedoes, lava and crumbling bridges are a few of the dangers found within- avoid being detected by Bowser's spotlight as much as you can!  Not technically a castle level but it sure feels like one- the torpedoes definitely boost the challenge but it's fun (5-hard).  5-Castle.  Avoid upright square-shaped spiked platforms that flip forward on the path you're walking on as well as charging chucks which is basically the entire theme of the level.  Eventually the platforms alter the way they move and there's a clever green star that's very tricky to grab later on- very tricky Nintendo!  Clever boss fight too (a giant spiky square-shaped upright-moving platform like the rest of them you see throughout the level, but this one's strategic with a weak spot.  Fast movements and accuracy are requirements to conquer it) (5-hard).6-1.  Finally a level that really takes advantage of the clear pipes!!  Popular preview level too, so I already knew what it was like- dodge fuzzies in pipes, a cloud level where you have to pick up a piranha plant and eat enemies with it as you race towards the end, etc.  Clear pipes are everywhere in this stage and it's pretty cool (3-easy).  6-2.  That eerie violin music from the ghost house in 3-3 returns however the concept here is to walk across a broken ship while absorbing a depressing tone overall.  Bullies from Super Mario 64 return.  Such annoying enemies they are too!  If you're not familiar with bullies, they make you bounce backwards when you bump into them which can be quite the hassle when all you're trying to do is avoid them.  This entire level is like a radically different perspective on the Super Mario World sunken ship stage.  The uniqueness of this stage gives it major points (4-easy).  6-3.  The craziest setting for a Mario game yet- a castle... but not any ordinary/redundant castle.  A Chinese pagoda castle!  With gongs and red sheets hanging across the walls in the background!  It's sort of maze-like where you have to hit switches to open/activate doorways and stairways while unintentionally releasing goombas.  After a while you go outside to the rooftop while hearing crickets chirping in the night background, and you use propeller blocks from Super Mario 3D Land to spin around and collect green coins and stars located in tricky spots while avoiding thwomps.  Eventually you arrive to a place where you have to avoid more rolling spiked logs (this time even trickier than before).  There's even a boomerang brothers suit.  Favorite level in the game (5-medium).  6-4.  Purple dark matter surrounds gated platforms that you have to walk across in addition to more colorful swingable vine-like panels and snake-resembling piranhas coming out of walls- the isometric design of this level makes it easy to miss where you need to go which can result in several unnecessary deaths.  The raft ride is too much fun to end so soon (3-medium).  6-A.  A clever boss fight involving a bully but colored gray and much bigger.  The clear pipe strategy is pretty cool and had me stumped for a little while.6-5.  A snow level with some really bizarre enemies; one a cloud that blows gusts of wind and subsequently blows you off the path and two, some kind of sidestepping brick foe (perhaps a miniature thwomp).  More snowmobile riding fun around the icy ponds avoiding snowmobile-riding goombas.  Beautifully created level.  This is a tricky level for a few reasons, mainly the wind-blowing clouds, slippery snowmobile controlling toughness, accidentally taking damage from slippery goombas on ice, a VERY tricky and short-timed green star area using the snowmobile, and a part where you can easily fall to your death if you don't properly time the rising wind (5-hard).  6-6.  A drab (brownish) setting where you climb the outside of a building using cloud platforms and make your way up higher.  Bullet bills occasionally make it hard since it's sometimes confusing knowing where to go (3-easy).  6-7.  A climbing/scrolling level that's sort of scary because of the approaching black mass (that sort of resembles a swarm of bees) that can instantly be the end of your life if you fall too far behind.  The closing trash-compactor like platforms at the end are quite tricky too.  I like the fluttering winged dry bones (4-medium).  6-B.  A series of snowball (or baseball) tossing tests to acquire a green star- one of them reminds me of basketball trampoline which is a creative idea for a Mario game.  The 2D ball-tossing thwomps room is fun too (4-medium).  6-Castle.  A scrolling stage where you have to toss bob-ombs to explode new areas and avoid fireball-shooting brothers.  Easy Boom Boom fight too (3-easy).  6-C.  A giant stone creature that reminds me of an identical-looking statue creature in the room before entering the snow area of Metroid Prime 3.  You have to avoid his pounding jumps and his round uh, rock bubbles? (2-easy).By the way I LOVE how frightening the world map looks in world 7.  Incredibly dangerous and threatening, as well as deceiving since it makes you believe it's the final world in the game but it's not.  7-1 (Castle).  When you first arrive, up ahead you will see fireball brothers shooting fireballs through clear pipes.  Eventually thwomps, stacked goombas, and generic clear pipes can be found.  It's boring and short (2-easy).  7-2 (Castle).  A top-down view in an underground stage.  Very similar to Galaxy 2's Boo Moon Galaxy.  You have to light blue panels yellow by walking on top of them while avoiding spinys and fireball-spitting piranhas.  Terrible stage (1-easy).  7-3 (Castle).  You have 100 seconds to run forward through rings, speed boosts, clear pipes, spikes... incredibly short but fun (4-easy).  7-4 (Castle).  The light blue matter that surrounds the stage is beautiful and reminds me of the Phazon in the final stage of Metroid Prime 3.  You have to climb across purple rock platforms with arrow-providing directions on top of them showing where you need to jump.  Expect to see flying dry bones, dangerous spiked logs rotating around, and being encouraged to push more bullies off the sides of the cliff (3-medium).  7-A (Castle).  Return of the boulder boss, this time much harder since you have to dodge fireballs that crawl on the ground AND fireballs that shoot in the air (4-hard).  7-B (Castle).  A return of the bully boss from 6-A.  This time he shoots blue fire (2-easy).  7-5 (Castle).  Climbing the inside of a glass building avoiding giant-sized thwomps, flying dry bones and magikoopas while surrounded by lava outside as heavy metal/slow moving music with a hint of Santana's mid 70's jazzy rhythmic period and particularly reminiscent of the song ""Dance Sister Dance"" serves as the main theme.  I LOVE it!  Anyway, guess what happens when you reach the very top?  You quickly have to run back down again to avoid an approaching cloud of dark matter (4-medium).7-6 (Castle).  Underground water stage with bloopers and purple fish with spiked logs.  A stone structure in the middle presents a dilemma for the player because it's hard to properly swim around the beautiful (but deadly) purple fish.  After this you're above ground temporarily to participate in a little koopa shell action and bounce around eliminating foes until you're underground again dealing with tougher fish due to an even tighter area compared to the fish-infested area in the beginning of the stage.  Love the flying fish near the flagpole finish (4-medium).  7-7 (Castle).  Intense lava-rising/lowering stage and avoiding a persistent type of fireball that shoots out of the lava and leaves a trail of hard-to-avoid fire.  Lots of fire dangers throughout this stage (5-hard).  7-Castle.  Another lava stage but this time with normal shooting lava balls (like the ones from the original NES Super Mario Bros.).  You will encounter boomerang brothers, spinning fireball rods, having to knock flame boulders into walls to open bridges, avoiding more of those upright-flipping square shaped platforms, hammer brothers... basically a VERY chaotic stage.  Love the cool ""James Bond meets heavy metal"" theme song during the Bowser fight.  The objective is to punch giant flaming boulders at Bowser's car while dodging fireballs and spike traps.  It's pretty hard.  REALLY awesome level overall (5-hard).  7-Toad.  This Toad level is really fun since it's the most challenging one so far- thwomps, conveyor belts, bullet bills... an abundance of obstacles with little room for error... yeah, best one yet (3-medium).The beginning levels of World 7 are sort of disappointing since those particular levels hardly ever match the intimidating fire-drenched presentation of the world map but the good news is that World 8's map has some catchy carnival-like music.8-1 (Bowser).  Expect to see spikes rotating on floors, flying dry bones, fireball brothers, and a cool setting with metal platforms above the sky.  I appreciate the detail of showing realistic raindrops dripping on the camera making it look like it's raining on our TV screen.  Mostly easy (3-easy).  8-2 (Bowser).  Flying fast-paced dinosaur-riding action across several patches of sky sand (yes, sandy skies!) avoiding goombas and wigglers.  Really fun.  Too bad the annoying hayride-like music from Super Mario 64 and again in Super Mario Galaxy 2 for Rolling Coaster Galaxy returns for this stage.  Worst. Music. Ever (5-easy).  8-3 (Bowser).  Platform-dominated level with barrel (cylinder) and Clockwork Ruins Galaxy-type wheel-shaped rotating platforms (from Super Mario Galaxy 2) but significantly toned down in difficulty and confusion in comparison to *that* extremely hard Galaxy (4-easy).  Bowser (Train Level).  A scrolling train level with long-necked birds, bullies, a fish tank (cool idea there) and swinging spiked logs standing in your way.  The female Boom Boom fight is surprisingly easy (2-easy).  8-4 (Bowser).  This level is made up of beautiful purple clouds with very dreamy Sweet Mystery Galaxy-like piano ambience and a similar concept in design- magical light blue portions of platforms that only become visible when you walk on them, giant thwomps, tricky placed rolling spiked logs and bullet bills.  Basically a Super Mario Galaxy ripoff with the floors and music, but it's fun at least (4-medium).  8-5 (Bowser).  In the first half you arrive to an underground water level where the water rises and lowers with huge spiked balls standing in your way.  You will ride a dinosaur in the second half, but unfortunately it's a horribly underused concept this time around- you ride him for what, 10 seconds?  Disappointing level overall. (2-easy).8-6 (Bowser).  Ghost house where you walk around inside a box costume with a ghost-destroying light attached to it.  You ride around on platforms, some of which are broken, and you're encouraged to make ghosts vanish the entire time.  It gets hard on the final platform ride due to so many ghosts appearing at once (2-medium).  Bowser Mystery Room (Level).  A series of 10 rooms with 10 green stars where you have to conquer several wall jumping skills that require fast movements and fancy accurate moves in order to be successful (4-hard).  8-7 (Bowser).  A lava stage where you have to make your way across by riding giant block-shaped platforms that literally flip back and forth across a path approximately every second.  You have to adjust/prepare for each flip accordingly because if not... down to your death you go.  Luckily there's a pattern to this.  Later on they become rectangular shaped.  This is *insanely* hard and requires absolute patience on the part of the player with an extra alert attention span.  Also you have to avoid fireballs that come out of the lava, crawl around on the ground, and leave a trail of fire behind (5-hard).  8-A (Castle).  A repeat of the 6-C boss, this time shiny bronze-colored and much faster.  Same strategy (4-medium).  8-B (Castle).  Repeat of 3-B boss with no noticeable differences (2-medium).  Bowser Final Castle Stage.  This is certainly a disappointment in both the level itself and the Bowser fight.  It begins on a rooftop with fireballs raining down from above (avoid them).  Soon you arrive to the Bowser fight.  It's a slow-moving scrolling climb up the outside of a building while wearing the cat suit making for a superhero-like (Spiderman) comparison.  You have to avoid Bowser whenever he appears on screen.  The second half of the battle is slightly harder in both avoiding Bowser's clones and the remainder of the climb to the top with the occasional twists and turns, but nothing too overwhelming, threatening or challenging.  POW!  So cheap!""",4,super mario craziness!,2013/11/30 0:00
A20DZX38KRBIT8,B00DC7G0GG,"Deimos .""""",90,6,"The game is well done graphically, the visuals are wonderful, the new 3d style is well done again graphically and the fun factor is decent.  Compared to the awesome control of Mario U im still trying to get used to the controls in a 3d style as for me Mario will always be a 2d game regardless of how good the graphics are. In this game and Mario U they are stunning but this game is hard to navigate as it's damn near impossible to determine where you going to land....again I love the smooth controls and camera angles of Mario U.  The multiplayer is kind of fun, my wife and I tried to enjoy it but it gets frustrating quickly for the control/camera limitations I mentioned above.  Once again going through the levels together is tough and if you get a little ahead of the other player(s) it kills you all or bubbles everyone which is very annoying.  The next thing is the cat suit power up, its way to overused like in every level, where are the racoon suits?  If you die 5 times in a level you get the while tanookie suit rendering you invincible save from pit falls which this whole game is.....  Overall Mario U is all you need for a great new Mario game this one is a real dud, it tries to pride itself on nestalgia but fails and the levels range from easy as hell to damn near impossible again due to the 3d mess of the controls and camera angles.  Not worth 60+ dollars by any stretch.",1,Bad camera angles lead to bad controls and becomes boring quickly.,2014/1/15 0:00
A2TCG2HV1VJP6V,B00DC7G0GG,Ryan Sil. (Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...,3,2,"Lately, the Mario series has been met with a couplecreativelybankrupttitles, leaving me to worry about the series's future a bit. However, those were just New Super Mario Bros. installments. Games like Super Mario 3D World show that THIS is where the effort is REALLY poured into! Super Mario 3D World is supposed to be the sequel to 2011'sSuper Mario 3D Landfor, well, the Nintendo 3DS.That's one thing that had me concerned during the first time the game was revealed. It's no doubt people were unimpressed at first, because it initially looked like a 3D Land rehash, and was not the super-rad 3D Mario platformer continuing in the structures ofMario 64,Sunshine, andGalaxy 1& 2.Honestly, though? I'm perfectly fine with this game.What Super Mario 3D World lacks in feeling like a successor to Galaxy, it makes up for in literally EVERYTHING ELSE! Nearly every single level in the game offers something new to the table, whether it be a new enemy, toy to play around with, or interesting and completely interactive scenery. One world in the game features more creativity and imagination than the New Super Mario series as a whole!!I mean, seriously. There's a level where you're on a speeding train, a level where you watch your shadows, a level taking place in an ancient city, a maze-like level with switch-like pads on the ground, a level where you use a Piranha Plant to eat other enemies, a level or few where you ride on a cute sea creature's back.....I could go on and on here. It's just absolutely fantastic.Oh yeah, get this - Peach isn't kidnapped here! Instead, you're saving fairies that are a lot like that of the ones inSuper Mario Bros. 2. And like that game, you get to choose from four different characters, each with their own abilities. Mario's average, Luigi jumps higher, Toad is quicker, and Peach glides (There's also a secret"" fifth character reappearing from Mario Galaxy). I love seeing Peach finally getting in on the action after so many years of saving her, and seeing her and Toad shoot fireballs and using the Cat Suit makes me smile.The game also lets you play with 2 to 4 other players. I'm pretty sure it was already chaotic enough to have to try and fight through the New Super Mario Bros. console games with your friends! But you know what? The chaos the multiplayer brings has always been great fun, regardless of whether or not you actually make progress. Plus, it's about time a 3D Mario game incorporated a legitimate multiplayer mode. I played through a majority of the main game with my two brothers, and things got crazy in the best way possible!If you're actually progressing through the game (Obviously best done in single-player), you may come across the fact that you will need to collect Green Stars to be able to enter various levels in the game. If you're familiar with collecting Yoshi Coins inSuper Mario World, or the Star Medals in 3D Land, then this is familiar territory. The Green Stars are hidden around every level,  and you can earn more by playing unique puzzle levels where you navigate Captain Toad to collect all of them, or by entering a series of challenges via the Mystery Boxes found on the map.I rememberSonic Lost Worldhad a feature like this, where you had to rescue amounts of animals to move on certain areas, but the problem in that game was that the amounts required were usually excessive, which meant you had to backtrack at least a little bit. Here, in Mario's case, it's not anywhere as annoying because there's so many alternative paths to take or unexplored levels still waiting to be played. You won't have to play a single level you already played. That is, unless you really want to dig deeper and deeper into the game to unlock even more levels, but I'll leave that up to you to decide.If there's anything I have to remotely complain about in Super Mario 3D World, it's...not really in the game itself, but rather Luigi Bros. Luigi Bros. is a version of theNES port of the Mario Bros. arcade gamethat serves as unlockable content (or if you have New Super Luigi U, you could already unlock it). Thing is - Luigi Bros. is literally just Mario Bros. except with two Luigis. Nothing else is different, which is rather disappointing.Super Mario 3D World is not exactly what I'd consider to be better than the 3D Mario games that preceded it (except for 3D Land), but those games have set the bar tremendously high, and this game is still one of the best Wii U games around, as well as the best Mario game since Galaxy. If you're a video game fan at all, you need to experience this game at..at least some point in your life. It can't go without saying that it's loads of fun.""",5,"Mario's BACK, baby!!!",2014/5/18 0:00

Since Mario started as a handheld game for simple minds.There were already attempts to make 3D games on Vectrex, Atari 2600, and even NES.I guess Mario finally made it on the Wii U.That proves how bad Mario games really are.And that is the same reason why Mario games appeal to babies and toddlers.Unfortunately they are the ones buying and rating this game, giving it a skewed 5-star rating.I suppose adults could buy one as a donation to the orphanage this Christmas.ONLY IF there is a major price drop for the holidays.",1,Mario is FINALLY 3D after so many years!

A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00DC7G0GG,S. Rhodes,5,3,"The Good:+The perfect blend of 2D and 3D Mario action+Really creative levels+New power ups are welcome+Lots of levels to explore and secrets to unlock+Simple gameplayThe Bad:-Some jumps are easy to misjudge-There is a really low challenge level to the game.  Lots of fun, but there's no need to coddle inexperienced players by giving them an item that completely takes away the challenge when the challenge here is fairly lowA couple of years ago on the 3DS there was a game called Super Mario 3D Land that came out, sold millions of copies and was regarded as one of Mario's finest adventures.  It was the perfect blend of what made the side scrolling Mario games so good mixed with the fun and exploration of the three dimensional Mario games.  It was a great hybrid that help remind us that Mario games are still fun nearly three decades later.  Super Mario 3D World continues what Mario 3D Land started, but it's a lot more creative and a lot more enthralling as a result.  Make no mistakes, this is one of Mario's best outings.One usually doesn't pick up a Mario game expecting story.  The same is true of 3D World.  What does change, however, is that this time Princess Peach isn't getting kidnapped.  Instead, Mario, Luigi, Peach and Toad are out exploring when they meet the Sprixie princess.  Suddenly Bowser shows up and kidnaps her.  So Mario and company go to the Sprixie Kingdom to save her.  As I said, Mario is never much for story.  It's all about the gameplay.  And here things go quite smoothly for Mario.  For those who picked up 3D Land everything about the basic gameplay will be familiar.  There are a couple of tweaks and additions that are nice, however.  Some that you might be wondering why Mario didn't do this ages ago.Like before, there is a world map.  Although this time around you aren't confided to just the basic path.  You can free roam the map and play some levels out of order. Each level has three green stars to collect, which more or less replace the star coins found in other Mario outings.  They help to unlock other levels as you progress.  Roaming the world map helps to establish that exploration is pretty important here and you'll find it in some of the levels as well.  There are mystery houses to go to and sometimes even puzzles to solve.  But best of all, it provides this sense that we're not just barreling down one path as we did before.  The levels themselves aren't too terribly long, but there is a huge variety of them, many of which you'll have to play a second time just to get a hold of all those stars and sometimes just to find things you may have missed.Mario 3D World allows you to play as four different characters.  Mario, Luigi, Toad or Peach.  Like Super Mario Bros. 2 the four have the same basic moves, but have different variations in some areas.  Mario is balanced in everything, for instance.  But Luigi jumps higher and falls slower.  Toad runs faster than everyone else while Peach can hover for a brief period of time.  There are many ways to approach a level, but you'll find that in some instances using one character is clearly better than another.  Everyone does, however, have the same basic move set.  Ground pounds, wall jumps and the like are all present.  Up to four players can team up at once and go around causing mayhem.  You can cooperate with each other and compete.  It's often far too tempting to mess your friends up just as much as help them.  As with New Super Mario Bros. you'll have fun with friends, but the game is certainly far more rewarding a solo experience.  The gamepad isn't neglected.  It can be used to reveal hidden secrets or stop enemies for a time, but it's hardly ever essential to the experience of the game.Returning once again is the &#34;suit&#34; system which allows Mario to transform.  Most everything here is pretty familiar.  Once again you have the fire flower and the mushroom.  Also returning is the Mega Mushroom and the Tanooki suit which will certainly make successful jumps a lot easier.  Most of these are brought directly from 3D Land and New Super Mario Bros.  The newest addition here is the cat suit which Mario and his allies can use to climb walls (or scale a flagpole at the end of a level).  There is also the cherry which make a duplicate Mario that can all be controlled by a single player.  These are awesome additions but they're not mind blowing additions unfortunately.  Mario is still impressive, but there is something to be said about the over-reliance on the tried and true as opposed to adding too many new things.  The level designs more than make up for this, but it's still quite sad that in this regard, Mario has made a significant leap in a long time.  At least it's all fun and really well designed and comes together in a strikingly good way.The only downside to all this is that Mario 3D World can sometimes be difficult because of how it is to judge jumps.  If you're not closely looking at your shadow or have a Tanooki suit you'll find some jumps can feel a bit off.  This isn't a huge problem as it is.  And even if it were, Mario 3D World is a far too forgiving game for it to give anyone any trouble.  The game is quite generous about giving you extra lives.  But more than that, Nintendo persists in giving players a leg up should they fail too many times.  If you die too often you'll get a white Tanooki suit which makes you invincible and able to coax through the level with no worries whatsoever.  You aren't obligated to take this option by any means... but by now the idea of the &#34;Super Guide&#34; (or pity token as I call it) is just sad.  In a game that gives you so many extra lives and isn't that punishing in the first place, players aren't likely to actually need this.Visually Mario is much more reliant on its aesthetic quality rather than it's outright power.  It's definitely a great looking game on all fronts, but the levels themselves and the characters benefit more from their artistic design.  It's got that charming cartoony look to it.  It's a good looking game with some really well designed stages.  The soundtrack, as always, is catchy.  Providing us with some nice new tunes while remixing familiar ones.There are some pretty cool creative choices and leaps for Super Mario 3D World.  The only thing that really keeps it down is that while it has some nice new additions, so much of it is relying quite heavily on what we've already grown familiar with in the Mario realm.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing because the levels are still fantastically creative.  Likewise, that blend of 2D and 3D Mario gameplay helps old and new fans alike really jump into the game.  For Mario fans, 3D World is a must own game.",5,Among the Best the Wii U Has to Offer,2013/11/22 0:00
